2HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE
CHAPTER ONE - THE RIDDLE HOUSE
The villagers of Little Hangleron still called it "the Riddle House," even though it
had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there. It stood on a hill
overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof,
and ivy spreading unchecked over its face. Once a fine-looking manor, and easily
the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House was now
damp, derelict, and unoccupied.
The Little Hagletons all agreed that the old house was "creepy." Half a century
ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older
inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce.
The story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so
many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore. Every
version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty years before, at
daybreak on a fine summer's morning when the Riddle House had still been well
kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles
dead.
The maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many
people as she could.
"Lying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice! Still in their dinner things!"
The police were summoned, and the whole of Little Hangleton had seethed with
shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement. Nobody wasted their breath
pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they had been most unpopular.
Elderly Mr. and Mrs. Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up
son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse. All the villagers cared about was the
identity of their murderer -- for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all
drop dead of natural causes on the same night.
The Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the whole village
seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders. They were rewarded for leaving
their firesides when the Riddles' cook arrived dramatically in their midst and
announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just been
arrested.
"Frank!" cried several people. "Never!"
Frank Bryce was the Riddles' gardener. He lived alone in a run-down cottage on
the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war with a very
stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for
the Riddles ever since.
3There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.
"Always thought he was odd," she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her
fourth sherry. "Unfriendly, like. I'm sure if I've offered him a cuppa once, I've
offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn't."
"Ah, now," said a woman at the bar, "he had a hard war, Frank. He likes the quiet
life. That's no reason to --"
"Who else had a key to the back door, then?" barked the cook. "There's been a
spare key hanging in the gardener's cottage far back as I can remember! Nobody
forced the door last night! No broken windows! All Frank had to do was creep up
to the big house while we was all sleeping..."
The villagers exchanged dark looks.
"I always thought that he had a nasty look about him, right enough," grunted a
man at the bar.
"War turned him funny, if you ask me," said the landlord.
"Told you I wouldn't like to get on the wrong side of Frank, didn't I, Dot?" said an
excited woman in the corner.
"Horrible temper," said Dot, nodding fervently. "I remember, when he was a
kid..."
By the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted that Frank
Bryce had killed the Riddles.
But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police
station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and
that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles' deaths
had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale. Nobody else in the
village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure Frank had invented
him.
Then, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on the
Riddles' bodies came back and changed everything.
The police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors had examined the
bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed,
shot, strangles, suffocated, or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all. In fact (the
report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all
appeared to be in perfet health -- apart from the fact that they were all dead. The
doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies)
that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face -- but as the
frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death?
As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were
4forced to let Frank go. The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton
churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while. To
everyone's surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his
cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.
"'S far as I'm concerned, he killed them, and I don't care what the police say," said
Dot in the Hanged Man. "And if he had any decency, he'd leave here, knowing as
how we knows he did it."
But Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden for the next family who
lived in the Riddle House, and then the next -- for neither family stayed long.
Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty
feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into
disrepair.
The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived there nor
put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it for "tax reasons," though
nobody was very clear what these might be. The wealthy owner continued to pay
Frank to do the gardening, however. Frank was nearing his seventy-seventh
birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering
around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds were starting to
creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them.
Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either. Boys from the
village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle House.
They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth.
Once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare. They knew that old Frank's
devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost to an obsession, and it
amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and
yelling croakily at them. Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him
because they, like their parents and grandparents, though him a murderer. So when
Frank awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old house,
he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to
punish him.
It was Frank's bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in his old
age. He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his
hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee. Standing at the sink, filling the
kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper
windows. Frank knew at once what was going on. The boys had broken into the
house again, and judging by the flickering quality of the light, they had started a
fire.
Frank had no telephone, in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police ever
since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles' deaths. He put down
the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was
soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook
by the door. He picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall,
5and set off into the night.
The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor did any of
the windows. Frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door
almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and
opened the door noiselessly.
He let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not entered it for many years;
nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the
hall was, and he groped his way towards it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay,
ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He reached the
hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side
of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick
upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick.
On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders were: At
the every end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone through
the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor. Frank edged closer and
closer, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.
The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised him. Then he
stopped moving and listened intently, for a man's voice spoke within the room; it
sounded timid and fearful.
"There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still hungry."
"Later," said a second voice. This too belonged to a man -- but it was strangely
high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind. Something about that voice
made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank's neck stand up. "Move me closer to
the fire, Wormtail."
Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. There came the clink
of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping
noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a
small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was wearing a
long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head. Then he went
out of sight again.
"Where is Nagini?" said the cold voice.
"I -- I don't know, My Lord," said the first voice nervously. "She set out to explore
the house, I think..."
"You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail," said the second voice. "I will need
feeding in the night. The journey has tired me greatly."
Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door, listening very
hard. There was a pause, and then the man called Wormtail spoke again.
"My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?"
6"A week," said the cold voice. "Perhapse longer. The place is moderately
comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the
Quidditch World Cup is over."
Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a
buildup of earwax, he had heard the word "Quidditch," which was not a word at
all.
"The -- the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?" said Wormtail. (Frank dug his finger
still more vigorously into his ear.) "Forgive me, but -- I do not understand -- why
should we wait until the World Cup is over?"
"Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all
over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on
the watch for signs of ususual activity, checking and double-checking identities.
They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we
wait."
Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the words
"Ministry of Magic," "wizards," and "Muggles." Plainly, each of these expressions
meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who
would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking
stick once more, and listened more closely still.
"Your Lordship is still determined, then?" Wormtail said quietly.
"Certainly I am determined, Wormtail." There was a note of menace in the cold
voice now.
A slight pause followed -- and the Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him
in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve.
"It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord."
Another pause, more protracted, and then --
"Without Harry Potter?" breathed the second voice softly. "I see..."
"My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!" said Wormtail, his voice
rising squeakily. "The boy is nothing to me, nothing at all! It is merely that if we
were to use another witch or wizard -- any wizard -- the thing could be done so
much more quickly! If you allowed me to leave you for a short while -- you know
that I can disguise myself most effectively -- I could be back here in as little as
two days with a suitable person --"
"I could use another wizard," said the cold voice softly, "that is true..."
"My Lord, it makes sense," said Wormtail, sounding thoroughly relieved now.
"Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult, he is so well protected --"
7"And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute? I wonder...perhaps the task
of nursing me has become wearisome for you, Wormtail? Could this suggestion of
abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me?"
"My Lord! I -- I have no wish to leave you, none at all --"
"Do not lie to me!" hissed the second voice. "I can always tell, Wormtail! You are
regretting that you ever returned to me. I revolt you. I see you flinch when you
look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me..."
"No! My devotion to Your Lordship --"
"Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here if you had
anywhere else to go. How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding every
few hours? Who is to milk Nagini?"
"But you seem so much stronger, My Lord --"
"Liar," breathed the second voice. "I am no stronger, and a few days alone would
be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your clumsy care.
Silence!"
Wormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at once. For a few
seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling. The the second man
spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.
"I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained to you, and I will
use no other. I have waited thirteen years. A few more months will make no
difference. As for the protection surrounding the boy, I believe my plan will be
effective. All that is needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail -- courage you
will find, unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldermort's wrath --"
"My Lord, I must speak!" said Wormtail, panic in his voice now. "All through our
journey I have gone over the plan in my head -- My Lord, Bertha Jorkin's
disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if we proceed, if I murder --"
"If?" whispered the second voice. "If? If you follow the plan, Wormtail, the
Ministry need never know that anyone else has died. You will do it quietly and
without fuss; I only wish that i could do it myself, but in my present
condition...Come, Wormtail, one more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear.
I am not asking you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful serant will have
rejoined us --"
"I am a faithful servant," said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his voice.
"Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never
wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement."
"I found you," said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice
now. "I was the one who found you. I brought you Bertha Jorkins."
8"That is true," said the second man, sounding amused. "A stroke of brilliance I
would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail -- though, if truth be told,
you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her, were you?"
"I -- I thought she might be useful, My Lord --"
"Liar," said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more pronounced than
ever. "However, I do not deny that her information was invaluable. Without it, I
could never have formed our plan, and for that, you will have your reward,
Wormtail. I will allow you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of
my followers would give their right hands to perform..."
"R-really, My Lord? What -- ?" Wormtail sounded terrified again.
"Ah, Wormtail, you don't want me to spoil the surprise? Your part will come at the
very end...but I promise you, you will have the honor of being just as useful as
Bertha Jorkins."
"You...you..." Wormtail's voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as though his mouth had
gone very dry. "You...are going...to kill me too?"
"Wormtail, Wormtail," said the cold voice silkily, "why would I kill you? I killed
Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite
useless. In any case, awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone
back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays. Wizards
who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic
witches at wayside inns..."
Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but it made
the second man laugh -- an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.
"We could have modified her memory? But Memory Charms can be broken by a
powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her. It would be an insult to her
memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail."
Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his
walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with the cold voice had killed a
woman. He was talking about it without any kind of remorse -- with amusement.
He was dangerous -- a madman. And he was planning more murders -- this boy,
Harry Potter, whoever he was -- was in danger --
Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police. He
would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the
village...but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was,
frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.
"One more murder...my faithful servant at Hogwarts...Harry Potter is as good as
mine, Wormtail. It is decided. There will be no more argument. But quiet...I think
I hear Nagini..."
9And the second man's voice changed. He started making noises such as Frank had
never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath. Frank
thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure.
And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway. He turned to
look, and found himself paralyzed with fright.
Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as it drew
nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a
gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long. Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared as its
undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor,
coming closer and closer -- What was he to do? The only means of escape was
into the room where the two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where he
was the snake would surely kill him --
But before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him, and then,
incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the spitting, hissing
noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in seconds, the tip of its
diamond-patterned tail had vanished through the gap.
There was sweat on Frank's forehead now, and the hand on the walking stick was
trembling. Inside the room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and Frank was
visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea...This man could talk to snakes.
Frank didn't understand what was going on. He wanted more than anything to be
back in his bed with his hot-water bottle. The problem was that his legs didn't
seem to want to move. As he stood there shaking and trying to master himself, the
cold voice switched abruptly to English again.
"Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail," it said.
"In-indeed, My Lord?" said Wormtail.
"Indeed, yes," said the voice, "According to Nagini, there is an old Muggle
standing right outside this room, listening to every word we say."
Frank didn't have a chance to hide himself. There were footsteps and then the door
of the room was flung wide open.
A short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed nose, and small, watery eyes
stood before Frank, a mixture of fear and alarm in his face.
"Invite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your manners?"
The cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire, but Frank
couldn't see the speaker. the snake, on the other hand, was curled up on the rotting
hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet dog.
Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still deeply shaken, Frank took a
firmer grip on his walking stick and limped over the threshold.
10The fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long, spidery shadows
upon the walls. Frank stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it seemed
to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn't even see the back of his
head.
"You heard everything, Muggle?" said the cold voice.
"What's that you're calling me?" said Frank defiantly, for now that he was inside
the room, now that the time had come for some sort of action, he felt braver; it had
always been so in the war.
"I am calling you a Muggle," said the voice coolly. "It means that you are not a
wizard."
"I don't know what you mean by wizard," said Frank, his voice growing steadier.
"All I know is I've heard enough to interest the police tonight, I have. You've done
murder and you're planning more! And I'll tell youthis too," he added, on a sudden
inspiration, "my wife knows I'm up here, and if I don't come back --"
"You have no wife," said te cold voice, very quietly. "Nobody knows you are here.
You told nobody that you were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle,
for he knows...he always knows..."
"Is that right?" said Frank roughly. "Lord, is it? Well, I don't think much of your
manners, My Lord. Turn 'round and face me like a man, why don't you?"
"But I am not a man, Muggle," said the cold voice, barely audible now over the
crackling of the flames. "I am much, much more than a man. However...why not? I
will face you...Wormtail, come turn my chair around."
The servant gave a whimper.
"You heard me, Wormtail."
Slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have done anything
than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay, the small man
walked forward and began to turn the chair. The snake lifted its ugly triangular
head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.
And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it. His
walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let out a
scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the
chair spoke as it raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound,
and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was dead before he hit the floor.
Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with a start.
11CHAPTER TWO - THE SCAR
Harry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running. He had
awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face. The old scar on
his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath his
fingers as though someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his skin.
He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other hand reaching out in the darkness
for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put them on and his bedroom
came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange light that was filtering through
the curtains from the street lamp outside the window.
Harry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still painful. He turned on the
lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe,
and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door. A skinny boy of fourteen
looked back at him, his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He
examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely. It looked normal,
but it was still stinging.
harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken. It
had seemed so real...There had been two people he knew and one he didn't ...He
concentrated hard, frowning, trying to remember...
The dim picture of a darkened room came to him...There had been a snake on a
hearth rug...a small man called Peter, nicknamed Wormtail...and a cold, high
voice...the voice of Lord Voldemort. Harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped
down into his stomach at the very thought...
He closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what Voldemort had looked like,
but it was impossible...All Harry knew was that at the moment when Voldemort's
chair had swung around, and he, Harry, had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt
a spasm of horror, which had awoken him...or had that been the pain in his scar?
And who had the old man been? For there had definitely been an old man; Harry
had watched him fall to the ground. It was all becoming confused. Harry put his
face into his hands, blocking out his bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of
that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands; the
details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them...Voldemort
and Wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed, though Harry could
not remember the name...and they had been plotting to kill someone else...him!
Harry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, and stared around his
bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there. As it happened,
there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room. A large wooden
trunk stood open at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron, broomstick, black
robes, and assorted spellbooks. Rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk
that was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which his snowy owl, Hedwig,
12usually perched. On the floor beside his bed a book lay open; Harry had been
reading it before he fell asleep last night. The pictures in this book were all
moving. Men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on
broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another.
Harry walked over to the book, picked it up, and watched on of the wizards score a
spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty-foot-high hoop. Then he
snapped the book shut. Even Quidditch -- in Harry's opinion, the best sport in the
world -- couldn't distract him at the moment. He placed Flying with the Cannons
on his bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew back the curtains to survey
the street below.
Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to
look inthe early hours of Saturday morning. All the curtains were closed. As far as
Harry could see through the darkness, there wasn't a living creature in sight, not
even a cat.
And yet...and yet...Harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it,
running a finger over his scar again. It wasn't the pain that bothered him; Harry
was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost all the bones from his right arm
once and had them painfully regrown in a night. The same arm had been pierced
by a venemous foot-long fang not long afterward. Only last year Harry had fallen
fifty feet from an airborn broomstick. He was used to bizarre accidents and
injuries; they were unavoidable if you attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble.
No, the thing that was bothering Harry was the last time his scar had hurt him, it
had been because Voldemort had been close by...But Voldemort couldn't be here,
now...The idea of Voldemort lurking in Privet Drive was absurd, impossible...
Harry listened closely to the silence around him. Was he half expecting to hear the
creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak? And then he jumped slightly as he heard
his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room.
Harry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid. There was no one in the house
with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, and they were plainly
still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless.
Asleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it wasn't as though they were
ever any help to him awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were
Harry's only living relatives. They were Muggles who hated and despised magic in
any form, which meant that Harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot.
They had explained away Harry's long absences at Hogwarts over the last three
years by telling everyone that he went to St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably
Criminal Boys. They knew perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, Harry
wasn't allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him
for anything that went wrong about the house. Harry had never been able to
confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world. The
13very idea of going to them when they awoke, and telling them about his scar
hurting him, and about his worries about Voldemort, was laughable.
And yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had come to live with the
Dursleys in the first place. If it hadn't been for Voldemort, Harry would not have
had the lightning scar on his forehead. If it hadn't been for Voldemort, Harry
would still have had parents...
Harry had been a year old the night that Voldemort -- the most powerful Dark
wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven
years -- arrived at his house and killed his father and mother. Voldemort had then
turned his wand on Harry; he had performed the curse that had disposed of many
full-grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power -- and, incredibly, it
had not worked. Instead of killing the small boy, the curse had rebounded upon
Voldemort. Harry had survived with nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on his
forehead, and Voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive. His powers
gone, his life almost extinguished, Voldemort had fled; the terror in which the
secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted,
Voldemort's followers had disbanded, and Harry Potter had become famous.
It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his eleventh birthday, that
he was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in
the hidden wizarding world knew his name. Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find
that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went. But he was used
to it now: At the end of this summer, he would be starting his fourth year at
Hogwarts, and Harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the
castle again.
But there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school. He looked
hopelessly around his room again, and his eye paused on the birthday cards his
two best friends had sent him at the end of July. What would they say if Harry
wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting?
At once, Hermione Granger's voice seemed to fill his head, shrill and panicky.
"Your scar hurt? Harry, that's really serious.... Write to Professor Dumbledore!
And I'll go and check Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions.... Maybe there's
something in there about curse scars. . . ."
Yes, that would be Hermione's advice: Go straight to the headmaster of Hogwarts,
and in the meantime, consult a book. Harry stared out of the window at the inky
blue-black sky. He doubted very much whether a book could help him now. As far
as he knew, he was the only living person to have survived a curse like
Voldemort's; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his symptoms
listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions. As for informing the
headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore went during the summer
holidays. He amused himself for a moment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long
silver beard, full length wizard's robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach
14somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose. Wherever
Dumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that Hedwig would be able to find him;
Harry's owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even without an
address. But what would he write?
Dear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to bother you, but my scar hurt this morning.
Yours sincerely, Harry Potter.
Even inside his head the words sounded stupid.
And so he tried to imagine his other best friend, Ron Weasley's, reaction, and in a
moment, Ron's red hair and long-nosed, freckled face seemed to swim before
Harry, wearing a bemused expression.
"Your scar hurt? But ... but You-Know-Who can't be near you now, can he? I
mean ... you'd know, wouldn't you? He'd be trying to do you in again, wouldn't be?
I dunno, Harry, maybe curse scars always twinge a bit... I'll ask Dad. . . ."
Mr. Weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the Misuse of Muggle
Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, but he didn't have any particular
expertise in the matter of curses, as far as Harry knew. In any case, Harry didn't
like the idea of the whole Weasley family knowing that he, Harry, was getting
jumpy about a few moments' pain. Mrs. Weasley would fuss worse than
Hermione, and Fred and George, Ron's sixteen- year-old twin brothers, might
think Harry was losing his nerve. The Weasleys were Harry's favorite family in the
world; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now (Ron had
mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn't
want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.
Harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What he really wanted (and it felt
almost shameful to admit it to himself) was someone like - someone like a parent:
an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who
cared about him, who had had experience with Dark Magic....
And then the solution came to him. It was so simple, and so obvious, that he
couldn't believe it had taken so long - Sirius.
Harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at his desk; he
pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded his eagle-feather quill with ink,
wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, still
marveling at the fact that he hadn't thought of Sirius straight away. But then,
perhaps it wasn't so surprising - after all, he had only found out that Sirius was his
godfather two months ago.
There was a simple reason for Sirius's complete absence from Harry's life until
then - Sirius had been in Azkaban, the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures
called dementors, sightless, soul-sucking fiends who had come to search for Sirius
at Hogwarts when he had escaped. Yet Sirius had been innocent - the murders for
which he had been convicted had been committed by Wormtail, Voldemort's
15supporter, whom nearly everybody now believed dead. Harry, Ron, and Hermione
knew otherwise, however; they had come face-to-face with Wormtail only the
previous year, though only Professor Dumbledore had believed their story.
For one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving the Dursleys at last,
because Sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared. But the
chance had been snatched away from him - Wormtail had escaped before they
could take him to the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for his life.
Harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak, and
since then, Sirius had been on the run. The home Harry might have had if
Wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer. It had been doubly
hard to return to the Dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever.
Nevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry, even if he couldn't be with
him. It was due to Sirius that Harry now had all his school things in his bedroom
with him. The Dursleys had never allowed this before; their general wish of
keeping Harry as miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his powers, had
led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer
prior to this. But their attitude had changed since they had found out that Harry
had a dangerous murderer for a godfather - for Harry had conveniently forgotten
to tell them that Sirius was innocent.
Harry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been back at Privet Drive.
Both had been delivered, not by owls (as was usual with wizards), but by large,
brightly colored tropical birds. Hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders;
she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before
flying off again. Harry, on the other hand, had liked them; they put him in mind of
palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that, wherever Sirius was (Sirius never
said, in case the letters were intercepted), he was enjoying himself. Somehow,
Harry found it hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight,
perhapse that was why Sirius had gone South. Sirius's letters, which were now
hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboards under Harry's bed, sounded
chearful, and in both of them he had reminded Harry to call on him if ever Harry
needed to. Well, he needed to right now, all right...
Harry's lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise
slowly crept into the room. Finally, when the sun had risen, when his bedroom
walls had turned gold, and when sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle
Vernon and Aunt Petunia's room, Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of
parchment and reread his finished letter.
Dear Sirius,
Thanks for your last letter. That bird was enormous; it could hardly get through
my window. Things are the same as usual here. Dudley's diet isn't going too well.
My aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday. They told him
they'd have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it, so he got really angry and
chucked his PlayStation out of the window. That's a sort of computer thing you
16can play games on. Bit stupid really, now he hasn't even got Mega-Mutilation Part
Three to take his mind off things.
I'm okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn
them all into bats if I ask you to.
A weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar hurt again. Last time that
happened it was because Voldemort was at Hogwarts. But I don't reckon he can be
anywhere near me now, can he? Do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years
afterward?
I'll send this with Hedwig when she gets back; she's off hunting at the moment.
Say hello to Buckbeak for me. Harry
Yes, thought Harry, that looked all right. There was no point putting in the dream;
he didn't want it to look as though he was too worried. He folded up the parchment
and laid it aside on his desk, ready for when Hedwig returned. Then he got to his
feet, stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more. Without glancing at his
reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast.
17CHAPTER THREE - THE INVITATION
By the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three Dursleys were already seated
around the table. None of them looked up as he entered or sat down. Uncle
Vernon's large red face was hidden behind the morning's Daily Mail, and Aunt
Petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her horselike
teeth.
Dudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow seemed to be taking up even more
space than usual. This was saying something, as he always took up an entire side
of the square table by himself. When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened
grapefruit onto Dudley's plate with a tremulous "There you are, Diddy darling,"
Dudley glowered at her. His life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had
come home for the summer with his end-of-year report.
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as
usual: Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy whose
teachers didn't understand him, while Uncle Vernon maintained that "he didn't
want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway." They also skated over the
accusations of bullying in the report - "He's a boisterous little boy, but he wouldn't
hurt a fly!" Aunt Petunia had said tearfully.
However, at the bottom of the report there were a few well-chosen comments from
the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could explain
away. No matter how much Aunt Petunia wailed that Dudley was big-boned, and
that his poundage was really puppy fat, and that he was a growing boy who needed
plenty of food, the fact remained that the school outfitters didn't stock
knickerbockers big enough for him anymore. The school nurse had seen what
Aunt Petunia's eyes - so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her
gleaming walls, and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors -
simply refused to see: that far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had
reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale.
So - after many tantrums, after arguments that shook Harry's bedroom floor, and
many tears from Aunt Petunia - the new regime had begun. The diet sheet that had
been sent by the Smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had
been emptied of all Dudley's favorite things - fizzy drinks and cakes, chocolate
bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things
that Uncle Vernon called "rabbit food." To make Dudley feel better about it all,
Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She now
passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed that it was a lot smaller than
Dudley's. Aunt Petunia seemed to feet that the best way to keep up Dudley's
morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get more to eat than Harry.
But Aunt Petunia didn't know what was hidden under the loose floorboard
upstairs. She had no idea that Harry was not following the diet at all. The moment
he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot
18sticks, Harry had sent Hedwig to his friends with pleas for help, and they had risen
to the occasion magnificently. Hedwig had returned from Hermione's house with a
large box stuffed full of sugar-free snacks. (Hermione's parents were dentists.)
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had obliged with a sack full of his own
homemade rock cakes. (Harry hadn't touched these; he had had too much
experience of Hagrid's cooking.) Mrs. Weasley, however, had sent the family owl,
Errol, with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies. Poor Errol, who was
elderly and feeble, had needed a full five days to recover from the journey. And
then on Harry's birthday (which the Dursleys had completely ignored) he had
received four superb birthday cakes, one each from Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and
Sirius. Harry still had two of them left, and so, looking forward to a real breakfast
when he got back upstairs, he ate his grapefruit without complaint.
Uncle Vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked
down at his own grapefruit quarter.
"Is this it?" he said grumpily to Aunt Petunia.
Aunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then nodded pointedly at Dudley, who
had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing Harry's with a very
sour look in his piggy little eyes.
Uncle Vernon gave a great sigh, which ruffled his large, bushy mustache, and
picked up his spoon.
The doorbell rang. Uncle Vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down
the hall. Quick as a flash, while his mother was occupied with the kettle, Dudley
stole the rest of Uncle Vernon's grapefruit.
Harry heard talking at the door, and someone laughing, and Uncle Vernon
answering curtly. Then the front door closed, and the sound of ripping paper came
from the hall.
Aunt Petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see
where Uncle Vernon had got to. She didn't have to wait long to find out; after
about a minute, he was back. He looked livid.
"You," he barked at Harry. "In the living room. Now."
Bewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time,
Harry got up and followed Uncle Vernon out of the kitchen and into the next
room. Uncle Vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them.
"So," he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face Harry as though
he were about to pronounce him under arrest. "So."
Harry would have dearly loved to have said, "So what?" but he didn't feel that
Uncle Vernon's temper should be tested this early in the morning, especially when
it was already under severe strain from lack of food. He therefore settled for
19looking politely puzzled.
"This just arrived," said Uncle Vernon. He brandished a piece of purple writing
paper at Harry. "A letter. About you."
Harry's confusion increased. Who would be writing to Uncle Vernon about him?
Who did he know who sent letters by the postman?
Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, then looked down at the letter and began to read
aloud:
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley,
We have never been introduced, but I am sure you have heard a great deal from
Harry about my son Ron.
As Harry might have told you, the final of the Quidditch World Cup takes place
this Monday night, and my husband, Arthur, has just managed to get prime tickets
through his connections at the Department of Magical Games and Sports.
I do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match, as this really is a once-in-a-
lifetime opportunity; Britain hasn't hosted the cup for thirty years, and tickets are
extremely hard to come by. We would of course be glad to have Harry stay for the
remainder of the summer holidays, and to see him safely onto the train back to
school.
It would be best for Harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the
normal way, because the Muggle postman has never delivered to our house, and I
am not sure he even knows where it is.
Hoping to see Harry soon,
Yours sincerely,
Molly Weasley
P.S. I do hope we've put enough stamps on.
Uncle Vernon finished reading, put his hand back into his breast pocket, and drew
out something else.
"Look at this," he growled.
He held up the envelope in which Mrs. Weasley's letter had come, and Harry had
to fight down a laugh. Every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square
inch on the front, into which Mrs. Weasley had squeezed the Dursleys' address in
minute writing.
"She did put enough stamps on, then," said Harry, trying to sound as though Mrs.
Weasley's was a mistake anyone could make. His uncle's eyes flashed.
20"The postman noticed," he said through gritted teeth. "Very interested to know
where this letter came from, he was. That's why he rang the doorbell. Seemed to
think it was funny."
Harry didn't say anything. Other people might not understand why Uncle Vernon
was making a fuss about too many stamps, but Harry had lived with the Dursleys
too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the
ordinary. Their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were
connected (however distantly) with people like Mrs. Weasley.
Uncle Vernon was still glaring at Harry, who tried to keep his expression neutral.
If he didn't do or say anything stupid, he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime.
He waited for Uncle Vernon to say something, but he merely continued to glare.
Harry decided to break the silence.
"So - can I go then?" he asked.
A slight spasm crossed Uncle Vernon's large purple face. The mustache bristled.
Harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache: a furious battle as
two of Uncle Vernon's most fundamental instincts came into conflict. Allowing
Harry to go would make Harry happy, something Uncle Vernon had struggled
against for thirteen years. On the other hand, allowing Harry to disappear to the
Weasleys' for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than
anyone could have hoped, and Uncle Vernon hated having Harry in the house. To
give himself thinking time, it seemed, he looked down at Mrs. Weasley's letter
again.
"Who is this woman?" he said, staring at the signature with distaste.
"You've seen her," said Harry. "She's my friend Ron's mother, she was meeting
him off the Hog - off the school train at the end of last term."
He had almost said "Hogwarts Express," and that was a sure way to get his uncle's
temper up. Nobody ever mentioned the name of Harry's school aloud in the
Dursley household.
Uncle Vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember
something very unpleasant.
"Dumpy sort of woman?" he growled finally. "Load of children with red hair?"
Harry frowned. He thought it was a bit rich of Uncle Vernon to call anyone
"dumpy," when his own son, Dudley, had finally achieved what he'd been
threatening to do since the age of three, and become wider than he was tall.
Uncle Vernon was perusing the letter again.
"Quidditch," he muttered under his breath. "Quidditch - what is this rubbish?"
Harry felt a second stab of annoyance.
21"It's a sport," he said shortly. "Played on broom- "
"All right, all right!" said Uncle Vernon loudly. Harry saw, with some satisfaction,
that his uncle looked vaguely panicky. Apparently his nerves couldn't stand the
sound of the word "broomsticks" in his living room. He took refuge in perusing
the letter again. Harry saw his lips form the words "send us your answer ... in the
normal way." He scowled.
"What does she mean, 'the normal way'?" he spat.
"Normal for us," said Harry, and before his uncle could stop him, he added, "you
know, owl post. That's what's normal for wizards."
Uncle Vernon looked as outraged as if Harry had just uttered a disgusting
swearword. Shaking with anger, he shot a nervous look through the window, as
though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the
glass.
"How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my
roof?" he hissed, his face now a rich plum color. "You stand there, in the clothes
Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back -"
"Only after Dudley finished with them," said Harry coldly, and indeed, he was
dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five
times so as to be able to use his hands, and which fell past the knees of his
extremely baggy jeans.
"I will not be spoken to like that!" said Uncle Vernon, trembling with rage.
But Harry wasn't going to stand for this. Gone were the days when he had been
forced to take every single one of the Dursleys' stupid rules. He wasn't following
Dudley's diet, and he wasn't going to let Uncle Vernon stop him from going to the
Quidditch World Cup, not if he could help it. Harry took a deep, steadying breath
and then said, "Okay, I can't see the World Cup. Can I go now, then? Only I've got
a letter to Sirius I want to finish. You know - my godfather."
He had done it, he had said the magic words. Now he watched the purple recede
blotchily from Uncle Vernon's face, making it look like badly mixed black currant
ice cream.
"You're - you're writing to him, are you?" said Uncle Vernon, in a would-be calm
voice - but Harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear.
"Well - yeah," said Harry, casually. "It's been a while since he heard from me, and,
you know, if he doesn't he might start thinking something's wrong."
He stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words. He could almost see the cogs
working under Uncle Vernon's thick, dark, neatly parted hair. If he tried to stop
Harry writing to Sirius, Sirius would think Harry was being mistreated. If he told
Harry he couldn't go to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would write and tell
22Sirius, who would know Harry was being mistreated. There was only one thing for
Uncle Vernon to do. Harry could see the conclusion forming in his uncle's mind as
though the great mustached face were transparent. Harry tried not to smile, to keep
his own face as blank as possible. And then -
"Well, all right then. You can go to this ruddy ... this stupid ... this World Cup
thing. You write and tell these - these Weasleys they're to pick you up, mind. I
haven't got time to go dropping you off all over the country. And you can spend
the rest of the summer there. And you can tell your - your godfather ... tell him ...
tell him you're going."
"Okay then," said Harry brightly.
He turned and walked toward the living room door, fighting the urge to jump into
the air and whoop. He was going ... he was going to the Weasleys', he was going
to watch the Quidditch World Cup!
Outside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley, who had been lurking behind the
door, clearly hoping to overhear Harry being told off. He looked shocked to see
the broad grin on Harry's face.
"That was an excellent breakfast, wasn't it?" said Harry. "I feel really full, don't
you?"
Laughing at the astonished look on Dudley's face, Harry took the stairs three at a
time, and hurled himself back into his bedroom.
The first thing he saw was that Hedwig was back. She was sitting in her cage,
staring at Harry with her enormous amber eyes, and clicking her beak in the way
that meant she was annoyed about something. Exactly what was annoying her
became apparent almost at once.
"OUCH!" said Harry as what appeared to be a small, gray, feathery tennis ball
collided with the side of his head. Harry massaged the spot furiously, looking up
to see what had hit him, and saw a minute owl, small enough to fit into the palm of
his hand, whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework. Harry then
realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet. Harry bent down, recognized
Ron's handwriting, then tore open the envelope. Inside was a hastily scribbled
note.
Harry - DAD GOT THE TICKETS - Ireland versus Bulgaria, Monday night.
Mum's writing to the Muggles to ask you to stay. They might already have the
letter, I don't know how fast Muggle post is. Thought I'd send this with Pig
anyway.
Harry stared at the word "Pig," then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming
around the light fixture on the ceiling. He had never seen anything that looked less
like a pig. Maybe he couldn't read Ron's writing. He went back to the letter:
23We're coming for you whether the Muggles like it or not, you can't miss the World
Cup, only Mum and Dad reckon it's better if we pretend to ask their permission
first. If they say yes, send Pig back with your answer pronto, and we'll come and
get you at five o'clock on Sunday. If they say no, send Pig back pronto and we'll
come and get you at five o'clock on Sunday anyway.
Hermione's arriving this afternoon. Percy's started work - the Department of
International Magical Cooperation. Don't mention anything about Abroad while
you're here unless you want the pants bored off you.
See you soon - Ron
"Calm down!" Harry said as the small owl flew low over his head, twittering
madly with what Harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter
to the right person. "Come here, I need you to take my answer back!"
The owl fluttered down on top of Hedwig's cage. Hedwig looked coldly up at it, as
though daring it to try and come any closer.
Harry seized his eagle-feather quill once more, grabbed a fresh piece of
parchment, and wrote:
Ron, it's all okay, the Muggles say I can come. See you five o'clock tomorrow.
Can't wait. Harry
He folded this note up very small, and with immense difficulty, tied it to the tiny
owl's leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement. The moment the note was
secure, the owl was off again; it zoomed out of the window and out of sight.
Harry turned to Hedwig.
"Feeling up to a long journey?" he asked her.
Hedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way.
"Can you take this to Sirius for me?" he said, picking up his letter. "Hang on ... I
just want to finish it."
He unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript.
If you want to contact me, I'll be at my friend Ron Weasley's for the rest of the
summer. His dad's got us tickets for the Quidditch World Cup!
The letter finished, he tied it to Hedwig's leg; she kept unusually still, as though
determined to show him how a real post owl should behave.
"I'll be at Ron's when you get back, all right?" Harry told her.
She nipped his finger affectionately, then, with a soft swooshing noise, spread her
enormous wings and soared out of the open window.
24Harry watched her out of sight, then crawled under his bed, wrenched up the loose
floorboard, and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake. He sat there on the floor
eating it, savoring the happiness that was flooding through him. He had cake, and
Dudley had nothing but grapefruit; it was a bright summer's day, he would be
leaving Privet Drive tomorrow, his scar felt perfectly normal again, and he was
going to watch the Quidditch World Cup. It was hard, just now, to feel worried
about anything - even Lord Voldemort.
25CHAPTER FOUR - BACK TO THE BURROW
By twelve o'clock the next day, Harry's school trunk was packed with his school
things and all his most prized possessions - the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited
from his father, the broomstick he had gotten from Sirius, the enchanted map of
Hogwarts he had been given by Fred and George Weasley last year. He had
emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food, double-checked
every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills, and taken
down the chart on the wall counting down the days to September the first, on
which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to Hogwarts.
The atmosphere inside number four, Privet Drive was extremely tense. The
imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the
Dursleys uptight and irritable. Uncle Vernon had looked downright alarmed when
Harry informed him that the Weasleys would be arriving at five o'clock the very
next day.
"I hope you told them to dress properly, these people," he snarled at once. "I've
seen the sort of stuff your lot wear. They'd better have the decency to put on
normal clothes, that's all."
Harry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He had rarely seen Mr. or Mrs. Weasley
wearing anything that the Dursleys would call "normal." Their children might don
Muggle clothing during the holidays, but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley usually wore long
robes in varying states of shabbiness. Harry wasn't bothered about what the
neighbors would think, but he was anxious about how rude the Dursleys might be
to the Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards.
Uncle Vernon had put on his best suit. To some people, this might have looked
like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it was because Uncle Vernon wanted to
look impressive and intimidating. Dudley, on the other hand, looked somehow
diminished. This was not because the diet was at last taking effect, but due to
fright. Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with
a curly pig's tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle
Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in London. It wasn't
altogether surprising, therefore, that Dudley kept running his hand nervously over
his backside, and walking sideways from room to room, so as not to present the
same target to the enemy.
Lunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn't even protest at the food (cottage
cheese and grated celery). Aunt Petunia wasn't, eating anything at all. Her arms
were folded, her lips were pursed, and she seemed to be chewing her tongue, as
though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.
"They'll be driving, of course?" Uncle Vernon barked across the table.
26"Er," said Harry.
He hadn't thought of that. How were the Weasleys going to pick him up? They
didn't have a car anymore; the old Ford Anglia they had once owned was currently
running wild in the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts. But Mr. Weasley had borrowed
a Ministry of Magic car last year; possibly he would do the same today?
"I think so," said Harry.
Uncle Vernon snorted into his mustache. Normally, Uncle Vernon would have
asked what car Mr. Weasley drove; he tended to judge other men by how big and
expensive their cars were. But Harry doubted whether Uncle Vernon would have
taken to Mr. Weasley even if he drove a Ferrari.
Harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he couldn't stand watching Aunt
Petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds, as though there had
been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros. Finally, at a quarter to five, Harry
went back downstairs and into the living room.
Aunt Petunia was compulsively straightening cushions. Uncle Vernon was
pretending to read the paper, but his tiny eyes were not moving, and Harry was
sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car.
Dudley was crammed into an armchair, his porky hands beneath him, clamped
firmly around his bottom. Harry couldn't take the tension; he left the room and
went and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping
fast from excitement and nerves.
But five o'clock came and then went. Uncle Vernon, perspiring slightly in his suit,
opened the front door, peered up and down the street, then withdrew his head
quickly.
"They're late!" he snarled at Harry.
I know," said Harry. "Maybe - er - the traffic's bad, or something."
Ten past five ... then a quarter past five ... Harry was starting to feel anxious
himself now. At half past, he heard Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia conversing in
terse mutters in the living room.
"No consideration at all."
"We might've had an engagement."
"Maybe they think they'll get invited to dinner if they're late."
"Well, they most certainly won't be," said Uncle Vernon, and Harry heard him
stand up and start pacing the living room. "They'll take the boy and go, there'll be
no hanging around. That's if they're coming at all. Probably mistaken the day. I
daresay their kind don't set much store by punctuality. Either that or they drive
some tin-pot car that's broken d- AAAAAAAARRRRRGH!"
27Harry jumped up. From the other side of the living room door came the sounds of
the three Dursleys scrambling, panic-stricken, across the room. Next moment
Dudley came flying into the hall, looking terrified.
"What happened?" said Harry. "What's the matter?"
But Dudley didn't seem able to speak. Hands still clamped over his buttocks, he
waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen. Harry hurried into the living room.
Loud bangings and scrapings were coming from behind the Dursleys' boarded-up
fireplace, which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it.
"What is it?" gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall and was staring,
terrified, toward the fire. "What is it, Vernon?"
But they were left in doubt barely a second longer. Voices could be heard from
inside the blocked fireplace.
"Ouch! Fred, no - go back, go back, there's been some kind of mistake - tell
George not to - OUCH! George, no, there's no room, go back quickly and tell Ron-
"
"Maybe Harry can hear us, Dad - maybe he'll be able to let us out-"
There was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fire.
"Harry? Harry, can you hear us?"
The Dursleys rounded on Harry like a pair of angry wolverines.
"What is this?" growled Uncle Vernon. "What's going on?"
"They - they've tried to get here by Floo powder," said Harry, fighting a mad
desire to laugh. "They can travel by fire - only you've blocked the fireplace - hang
on -"
He approached the fireplace and called through the boards.
"Mr. Weasley? Can you hear me?"
The hammering stopped. Somebody inside the chimney piece said, "Shh!"
"Mr. Weasley, it's Harry ... the fireplace has been blocked up. You won't be able to
get through there."
"Damn!" said Mr. Weasley's voice. "What on earth did they want to block up the
fireplace for?"
"They've got an electric fire," Harry explained.
"Really?" said Mr. Weasley's voice excitedly. "Eclectic, you say? With a plug?
Gracious, I must see that.... Let's think ... ouch, Ron!"
28Ron's voice now joined the others'.
"What are we doing here? Has something gone wrong?"
"Oh no, Ron," came Fred's voice, very sarcastically. "No, this is exactly where we
wanted to end up."
"Yeah, we're having the time of our lives here," said George, whose voice sounded
muffled, as though he was squashed against the wall.
"Boys, boys. . ." said Mr. Weasley vaguely. "I'm trying to think what to do.... Yes
... only way. . . Stand back, Harry."
Harry retreated to the sofa. Uncle Vernon, however, moved forward.
"Wait a moment!" he bellowed at the fire. "What exactly are you going to -"
BANG.
The electric fire shot across the room as the boarded-up fireplace burst outward,
expelling Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, and Ron in a cloud of rubble and loose
chippings. Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table; Uncle
Vernon caught her before she hit the floor, and gaped, speechless, at the Weasleys,
all of whom had bright red hair, including Fred and George, who were identical to
the last freckle.
"That's better," panted Mr. Weasley, brushing dust from his long green robes and
straightening his glasses. "Ah - you must be Harry's aunt and uncle!"
Tall, thin, and balding, he moved toward Uncle Vernon, his hand outstretched, but
Uncle Vernon backed away several paces, dragging Aunt Petunia. Words utterly
failed Uncle Vernon. His best suit was covered in white dust, which had settled in
his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty years.
"Er - yes - sorry about that," said Mr. Weasley, lowering his hand and looking
over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace. "It's all my fault. It just didn't occur to
me that we wouldn't be able to get out at the other end. I had your fireplace
connected to the Floo Network, you see - just for an afternoon, you know, so we
could get Harry. Muggle fireplaces aren't supposed to be connected, strictly
speaking - but I've got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it
for me. I can put it right in a jiffy, though, don't worry. I'll light a fire to send the
boys back, and then I can repair your fireplace before I Disapparate."
Harry was ready to bet that the Dursleys hadn't understood a single word of this.
They were still gaping at Mr. Weasley, thunderstruck. Aunt Petunia staggered
upright again and hid behind Uncle Vernon.
"Hello, Harry!" said Mr. Weasley brightly. "Got your trunk ready?"
"It's upstairs," said Harry, grinning back.
29"We'll get it," said Fred at once. Winking at Harry, he and George left the room.
They knew where Harry's bedroom was, having once rescued him from it in the
dead of night. Harry suspected that Fred and George were hoping for a glimpse of
Dudley; they had heard a lot about him from Harry.
"Well," said Mr. Weasley, swinging his arms slightly, while he tried to find words
to break the very nasty silence. "Very - erm - very nice place you've got here."
As the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick, this
remark didn't go down too well with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon's face purpled
once more, and Aunt Petunia started chewing her tongue again. However, they
seemed too scared to actually say anything.
Mr. Weasley was looking around. He loved everything to do with Muggles. Harry
could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder.
"They run off eckeltricity, do they?" he said knowledgeably. "Ah yes, I can see the
plugs. I collect plugs," he added to Uncle Vernon. "And batteries. Got a very large
collection of batteries. My wife thinks I'm mad, but there you are."
Uncle Vernon clearly thought Mr. Weasley was mad too. He moved ever so
slightly to the right, screening Aunt Petunia from view, as though he thought Mr.
Weasley might suddenly run at them and attack.
Dudley suddenly reappeared in the room. Harry could hear the clunk of his trunk
on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared Dudley out of the kitchen.
Dudley edged along the wall, gazing at Mr. Weasley with terrified eyes, and
attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father. Unfortunately, Uncle
Vernon's bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt Petunia, was nowhere near
enough to conceal Dudley.
"Ah, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?" said Mr. Weasley, taking another brave stab
at making conversation.
"Yep," said Harry, "that's Dudley."
He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other; the
temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming. Dudley was still
clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off. Mr. Weasley, however,
seemed genuinely concerned at Dudley's peculiar behavior. Indeed, from the tone
of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr. Weasley thought
Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought he was, except that Mr. Weasley
felt sympathy rather than fear.
"Having a good holiday, Dudley?" he said kindly.
Dudley whimpered. Harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive
backside.
Fred and George came back into the room carrying Harry's school trunk. They
30glanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley. Their faces cracked into
identical evil grins.
"Ah, right," said Mr. Weasley. "Better get cracking then."
He pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand. Harry saw the
Dursleys draw back against the wall as one.
"Incendio!" said Mr. Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind
him.
Flames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though they had been
burning for hours. Mr. Weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket,
untied it, took a pinch of the powder inside, and threw it onto the flames, which
turned emerald green and roared higher than ever.
"Off you go then, Fred," said Mr. Weasley.
"Coming," said Fred. "Oh no - hang on -"
A bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred's pocket and the contents were now rolling
in every direction - big, fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers.
Fred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pocket, then gave the
Dursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward, and walked right into the fire, saying
"the Burrow!" Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering gasp. There was a whooshing
sound, and Fred vanished.
"Right then, George," said Mr. Weasley, "you and the trunk."
Harry helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its
end so that he could hold it better. Then, with a second whoosh, George had cried
"the Burrow!" and vanished too.
"Ron, you next," said Mr. Weasley.
"See you," said Ron brightly to the Dursleys. He grinned broadly at Harry, then
stepped into the fire, shouted "the Burrow!" and disappeared.
Now Harry and Mr. Weasley alone remained.
"Well . . . 'bye then," Harry said to the Dursleys.
They didn't say anything at all. Harry moved toward the fire, but just as he reached
the edge of the hearth, Mr. Weasley put out a hand and held him back. He was
looking at the Dursleys in amazement.
"Harry said good-bye to you," he said. "Didn't you hear him?"
"It doesn't matter," Harry muttered to Mr. Weasley. "Honestly, I don't care."
Mr. Weasley did not remove his hand from Harry's shoulder.
31"You aren't going to see your nephew till next summer," he said to Uncle Vernon
in mild indignation. "Surely you're going to say good-bye?"
Uncle Vernon's face worked furiously. The idea of being taught consideration by a
man who had just blasted away half his living room wall seemed to be causing
him intense suffering. But Mr. Weasley's wand was still in his hand, and Uncle
Vernon's tiny eyes darted to it once, before he said, very resentfully, "Good-bye,
then."
"See you," said Harry, putting one foot forward into the green flames, which felt
pleasantly like warm breath. At that moment, however, a horrible gagging sound
erupted behind him, and Aunt Petunia started to scream.
Harry wheeled around. Dudley was no longer standing behind his parents. He was
kneeling beside the coffee table, and he was gagging and sputtering on a foot-long,
purple, slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth. One bewildered second
later, Harry realized that the foot-long thing was Dudley's tongue - and that a
brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him.
Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley, seized the end of his
swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth; unsurprisingly,
Dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever, trying to fight her off. Uncle Vernon
was bellowing and waving his arms around, and Mr. Weasley had to shout to
make himself heard.
"Not to worry, I can sort him out!" he yelled, advancing on Dudley with his wand
outstretched, but Aunt Petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top
of Dudley, shielding him from Mr. Weasley.
"No, really!" said Mr. Weasley desperately. "It's a simple process it was the toffee
- my son Fred - real practical joker - but it's only an Engorgement Charm - at least,
I think it is - please, I can correct it -"
But far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more panic- stricken; Aunt
Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging Dudley's tongue as though determined
to rip it out; Dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his
mother and his tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had lost control completely, seized
a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at Mr. Weasley,
who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace.
"Now really!" said Mr. Weasley angrily, brandishing his wand. "I'm trying to
help!"
Bellowing like a wounded hippo, Uncle Vernon snatched up another ornament.
"Harry, go! Just go!" Mr. Weasley shouted, his wand on Uncle Vernon. "I'll sort
this out!"
Harry didn't want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon's second ornament narrowly
32missed his left ear, and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to Mr.
Weasley. He stepped into the fire, looking over his shoulder as he said "the
Burrow!" His last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of Mr. Weasley blasting
a third ornament out of Uncle Vernon's hand with his wand, Aunt Petunia
screaming and lying on top of Dudley, and Dudley's tongue lolling around like a
great slimy python. But next moment Harry had begun to spin very fast, and the
Dursleys' living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald-green flames.
33CHAPTER FIVE - WEASLEYS' WIZARD WHEEZES
Harry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to his sides, blurred fireplaces
flashing past him, until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes. Then, when at
last he felt himself slowing down, he threw out his hands and came to a halt in
time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the Weasleys' kitchen fire.
"Did he eat it?" said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull Harry to his fee
"Yeah," said Harry, straightening up. "What was it?"
"Ton-Tongue Toffee," said Fred brightly. "George and I invented them, and we've
been looking for someone to test them on all summer. . . ."
The tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked around and saw that Ron
and George were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red-haired people
Harry had never seen before, though he knew immediately who they must be: Bill
and Charlie, the two eldest Weasley brothers.
"How're you doing, Harry?" said the nearer of the two, grinning at him and
holding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under
his fingers. This had to be Charlie, who worked with dragons in Romania. Charlie
was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were both
long and lanky. He had a broad, good-natured face, which was weather-beaten and
so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were muscular, and one of them
had a large, shiny burn on it.
Bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry's hand. Bill came as something
of a surprise. Harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank, Gringotts, and
that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts; Harry had always imagined Bill to be an
older version of Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone
around. However, Bill was - there was no other word for it - cool. He was tall,
with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail. He was wearing an earring with
what looked like a fang dangling from it. Bill's clothes would not have looked out
of place at a rock concert, except that Harry recognized his boots to be made, not
of leather, but of dragon hide.
Before any of them could say anything else, there was a faint popping noise, and
Mr. Weasley appeared out of thin air at George's shoulder. He was looking angrier
than Harry had ever seen him.
"That wasn't funny Fred!" he shouted. "What on earth did you give that Muggle
boy?"
"I didn't give him anything," said Fred, with another evil grin. I just dropped it.... It
was his fault he went and ate it, I never told him to."
34"You dropped it on purpose!" roared Mr. Weasley. "You knew he'd eat it, you
knew he was on a diet -"
"How big did his tongue get?" George asked eagerly.
"It was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it!"
Harry and the Weasleys roared with laughter again.
"It isn't funny!" Mr. Weasley shouted. "That sort of behavior seriously undermines
wizard-Muggle relations! I spend half my life campaigning against the
mistreatment of Muggles, and my own sons
"We didn't give it to him because he's a Muggle!" said Fred indignantly.
"No, we gave it to him because he's a great bullying git," said George. "Isn't he,
Harry?"
"Yeah, he is, Mr. Weasley," said Harry earnestly.
"That's not the point!" raged Mr. Weasley. "You wait until I tell your mother -"
"Tell me what?" said a voice behind them.
Mrs. Weasley had just entered the kitchen. She was a short, plump woman with a
very kind face, though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion.
"Oh hello, Harry, dear," she said, spotting him and smiling. Then her eyes snapped
back to her husband. "Tell me what, Arthur?"
Mr. Weasley hesitated. Harry could tell that, however angry he was with Fred and
George, he hadn't really intended to tell Mrs. Weasley what had happened. There
was a silence, while Mr. Weasley eyed his wife nervously. Then two girls
appeared in the kitchen doorway behind Mrs. Weasley. One, with very bushy
brown hair and rather large front teeth, was Harry's and Ron's friend, Hermione
Granger. The other, who was small and red-haired, was Ron's younger sister,
Ginny. Both of them smiled at Harry, who grinned back, which made Ginny go
scarlet - she had been very taken with Harry ever since his first visit to the
Burrow.
"Tell me what, Arthur?" Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of voice.
"It's nothing, Molly," mumbled Mr. Weasley, "Fred and George just - but I've had
words with them -"
"What have they done this time?" said Mrs. Weasley. "If it's got anything to do
with Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes -"
"Why don't you show Harry where he's sleeping, Ron?" said Hermione from the
doorway.
35"He knows where he's sleeping," said Ron, "in my room, he slept there last -"
"We can all go," said Hermione pointedly.
"Oh," said Ron, cottoning on. "Right."
"Yeah, we'll come too," said George.
"You stay where you are!" snarled Mrs. Weasley.
Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set off
along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the
house to the upper stories.
"What are Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes?" Harry asked as they climbed.
Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn't.
"Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George's
room," said Ron quietly. "Great long price lists for stuff they've invented. Joke
stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. It was brilliant, I
never knew they'd been inventing all that . . ."
"We've been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought
they were actually making things," said Ginny. "We thought they just liked the
noise."
"Only, most of the stuff - well, all of it, really - was a bit dangerous," said Ron,
"and, you know, they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money,
and Mum went mad at them. Told them they weren't allowed to make any more of
it, and burned all the order forms.... She's furious at them anyway. They didn't get
as many O.W.L.s as she expected."
O.W.L.s were Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the examinations Hogwarts students
took at the age of fifteen.
"And then there was this big row," Ginny said, "because Mum wants them to go
into the Ministry of Magic like Dad, and they told her all they want to do is open a
joke shop."
Just then a door on the second landing opened, and a face poked out wearing horn-
rimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression.
"Hi, Percy," said Harry.
"Oh hello, Harry," said Percy. "I was wondering who was making all the noise.
I'm trying to work in here, you know I've got a report to finish for the office - and
it's rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the
stairs."
"We're not thundering, "said Ron irritably. "We're walking. Sorry if we've
36disturbed the top-secret workings of the Ministry of Magic."
"What are you working on?" said Harry.
"A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation," said Percy
smugly. "We're trying to standardize cauldron thickness. Some of these foreign
imports are just a shade too thin - leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost
three percent a year -"
"That'll change the world, that report will," said Ron. "Front page of the Daily
Prophet, I expect, cauldron leaks."
Percy went slightly pink.
"You might sneer, Ron," he said heatedly, "but unless some sort of international
law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow-
bottomed products that seriously endanger -"
"Yeah, yeah, all right," said Ron, and he started off upstairs again. Percy slammed
his bedroom door shut. As Harry, Hermione, and Ginny followed Ron up three
more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them. It sounded
as though Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Weasley about the toffees.
The room at the top of the house where Ron slept looked much as it had the last
time that Harry had come to stay: the same posters of Ron's favorite Quidditch
team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping
ceiling, and the fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously held frog
spawn, now contained one extremely large frog. Ron's old rat, Scabbers, was here
no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered Ron's letter to
Harry in Privet Drive. It was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering
madly.
"Shut up, Pig," said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had
been squeezed into the room. "Fred and George are in here with us, because Bill
and Charlie are in their room," he told Harry. "Percy gets to keep his room all to
himself because he's got to work."
"Er - why are you calling that owl Pig?" Harry asked Ron.
"Because he's being stupid," said Ginny, "Its proper name is Pigwidgeon."
"Yeah, and that's not a stupid name at all," said Ron sarcastically. "Ginny named
him," he explained to Harry. "She reckons it's sweet. And I tried to change it, but it
was too late, he won't answer to anything else. So now he's Pig. I've got to keep
him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes. He annoys me too, come to
that.
Pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly. Harry knew Ron too
well to take him seriously. He had moaned continually about his old rat, Scabbers,
but had been most upset when Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have
37eaten him.
"Where's Crookshanks?" Harry asked Hermione now.
"Out in the garden, I expect," she said. "He likes chasing gnomes. He's never seen
any before."
"Percy's enjoying work, then?" said Harry, sitting down on one of the beds and
watching the Chudley Cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceiling.
"Enjoying it?" said Ron darkly. "I don't reckon he'd come home if Dad didn't make
him. He's obsessed. Just don't get him onto the subject of his boss. According to
Mr. Crouch ... as I was saying to Mr. Crouch ... Mr. Crouch is of the opinion ...
Mr. Crouch was telling me ... They'll be announcing their engagement any day
now."
"Have you had a good summer, Harry?" said Hermione. "Did you get our food
parcels and everything?"
"Yeah, thanks a lot, " said Harry. "They saved my life, those cakes.
"And have you heard from -?" Ron began, but at a look from Hermione he fell
silent. Harry knew Ron had been about to ask about Sirius. Ron and Hermione had
been so deeply involved in helping Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that
they were almost as concerned about Harry's godfather as he was. However,
discussing him in front of Ginny was a bad idea. Nobody but themselves and
Professor Dumbledore knew about how Sirius had escaped, or believed in his
innocence.
"I think they've stopped arguing," said Hermione, to cover the awkward moment,
because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron to Harry. "Shall we go down and
help your mum with dinner?"
"Yeah, all right," said Ron. The four of them left Ron's room and went back
downstairs to find Mrs. Weasley alone in the kitchen, looking extremely bad-
tempered.
"We're eating out in the garden," she said when they came in. "There's just not
room for eleven people in here. Could you take the plates outside, girls? Bill and
Charlie are setting up the tables. Knives and forks, please, you two," she said to
Ron and Harry, pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended
at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so fast that they
ricocheted off the walls and ceiling.
"Oh for heaven's sake," she snapped, now directing her wand at a dustpan, which
hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the floor, scooping up the
potatoes. "Those two!" she burst out savagely, now pulling pots and pans out of a
cupboard, and Harry knew she meant Fred and George. I don't know what's going
to happen to them, I really don't. No ambition, unless you count making as much
38trouble as they possibly can...."
Mrs. Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and
began to wave her wand around inside it. A creamy sauce poured from the wand
tip as she stirred.
"It's not as though they haven't got brains, she continued irritably, taking the
saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand, "but
they're wasting them, and unless they pull themselves together soon, they'll be in
real trouble. I've had more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put
together. If they carry on the way they're going, they'll end up in front of the
Improper Use of Magic Office."
Mrs. Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer, which shot open. Harry and
Ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it, flew across the
kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which had just been tipped back into the
sink by the dustpan.
"I don't know where we went wrong with them," said Mrs. Weasley, putting down
her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans. "It's been the same for
years, one thing after another, and they won't listen to - OH NOT AGAIN!"
She had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted a loud squeak and
turned into a giant rubber mouse.
"One of their fake wands again!" she shouted. "How many times have I told them
not to leave them lying around?"
She grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove
was smoking.
"C'mon," Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a handful of cutlery from the open
drawer, "let's go and help Bill and Charlie."
They left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door into the yard.
They had only gone a few paces when Hermione's bandy-legged ginger cat,
Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottle-brush tail held high in the air,
chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs. Harry recognized it instantly as
a gnome. Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very fast as it
sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the Wellington boots that
lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as
Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to reach it. Meanwhile, a very
loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house. The source of
the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden, and saw that Bill and
Charlie both had their wands out, and were making two battered old tables fly high
above the lawn, smashing into each other, each attempting to knock the other's out
of the air. Fred and George were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione
was hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety.
39Bill's table caught Charlie's with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off.
There was a clatter from overhead, and they all looked up to see Percy's head
poking out of a window on the second floor.
"Will you keep it down?!" he bellowed.
"Sorry, Perce," said Bill, grinning. "How're the cauldron bottoms coming on?"
"Very badly," said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window shut. Chuckling,
Bill and Charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass, end to end, and then, with
a flick of his wand, Bill reattached the table leg and conjured tablecloths from
nowhere.
By seven o'clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of Mrs.
Weasley's excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione were
settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep-blue sky. To somebody who
had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise,
and at first, Harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken and
ham pie, boiled potatoes, and salad.
At the far end of the table, Percy was telling his father all about his report on
cauldron bottoms.
"I've told Mr. Crouch that I'll have it ready by Tuesday," Percy was saying
pompously. "That's a bit sooner than he expected it, but I like to keep on top of
things. I think he'll be grateful I've done it in good time, I mean, its extremely busy
in our department just now, what with all the arrangements for the World Cup.
We're just not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical Games
and Sports. Ludo Bagman -"
"I like Ludo," said Mr. Weasley mildly. "He was the one who got us such good
tickets for the Cup. I did him a bit of a favor: His brother, Otto, got into a spot of
trouble - a lawnmower with unnatural powers - I smoothed the whole thing over."
"Oh Bagman's likable enough, of course," said Percy dismissively, "but how he
ever got to be Head of Department ... when I compare him to Mr. Crouch! I can't
see Mr. Crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out
what's happened to them. You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a
month now? Went on holiday to Albania and never came back?"
"Yes, I was asking Ludo about that," said Mr. Weasley, frowning. "He says
Bertha's gotten lost plenty of times before now - though must say, if it was
someone in my department, I'd be worried. . . ."
"Oh Bertha's hopeless, all right," said Percy. "I hear she's been shunted from
department to department for years, much more trouble than she's worth ... but all
the same, Bagman ought to be trying to find her. Mr. Crouch has been taking a
personal interest, she worked in our department at one time, you know, and I think
Mr. Crouch was quite fond of her - but Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she
40probably misread the map and ended up in Australia instead of Albania. However"
- Percy heaved an impressive sigh and took a deep swig of elderflower wine -
"we've got quite enough on our plates at the Department of International Magical
Cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too. As you
know, we've got another big event to organize right after the World Cup."
Percy cleared his throat significantly and looked down toward the end of the table
where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sitting. "You know the one I'm talking
about, Father." He raised his voice slightly. "The top-secret one."
Ron rolled his eyes and muttered to Harry and Hermione, "He's been trying to get
us to ask what that event is ever since he started work. Probably an exhibition of
thick-bottomed cauldrons."
In the middle of the table, Mrs. Weasley was arguing with Bill about his earring,
which seemed to be a recent acquisition.
". . . with a horrible great fang on it. Really, Bill, what do they say at the bank?"
"Mum,.no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home plenty
of treasure," said Bill patiently.
"And your hair's getting silly, dear," said Mrs. Weasley, fingering her wand
lovingly." I wish you'd let me give it a trim. . . ."
"I like it," said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill. "You're so old-fashioned,
Mum. Anyway, it's nowhere near as long as Professor Dumbledore's...."
Next to Mrs. Weasley, Fred, George, and Charlie were all talking spiritedly about
the World Cup.
"It's got to be Ireland," said Charlie thickly, through a mouthful of potato. "They
flattened Peru in the semifinals."
"Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum, though," said Fred.
"Krum's one decent player, Ireland has got seven," said Charlie shortly. "I wish
England had got through. That was embarrassing, that was."
"What happened?" said Harry eagerly, regretting more than ever his isolation from
the wizarding world when he was stuck on Privet Drive.
"Went down to Transylvania, three hundred and ninety to ten," said Charlie
gloomily. "Shocking performance. And Wales lost to Uganda, and Scotland was
slaughtered by Luxembourg."
Harry had been on the Gryffindor House Quidditch team ever since his first year at
Hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the world, a Firebolt. Flying
came more naturally to Harry than anything else in the magical world, and he
played in the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor House team.
41Mr. Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had
their homemade strawberry ice cream, and by the time they had finished, moths
were fluttering low over the table, and the warm air was perfumed with the smells
of grass and honeysuckle. Harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with
the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes,
laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks.
Ron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy
talking, then he said very quietly to Harry, "So - have you heard from Sirius
lately?"
Hermione looked around, listening closely.
"Yeah," said Harry softly, "twice. He sounds okay. I wrote to him yesterday. He
might write back while I'm here."
He suddenly remembered the reason he had written to Sirius, and for a moment
was on the verge of telling Ron and Hermione about his scar hurting again, and
about the dream that had awoken him ... but he really didn't want to worry them
just now, not when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful.
"Look at the time," Mrs. Weasley said suddenly, checking her wristwatch. "You
really should be in bed, the whole lot of you you'll be up at the crack of dawn to
get to the Cup. Harry, if you leave your school list out, I'll get your things for you
tomorrow in Diagon Alley. I'm getting everyone else's. There might not be time
after the World Cup, the match went on for five days last time."
"Wow - hope it does this time!" said Harry enthusiastically.
"Well, I certainly don't," said Percy sanctimoniously. "I shudder to think what the
state of my in-tray would be if I was away from work for five days."
"Yeah, someone might slip dragon dung in it again, eh, Perce?" said Fred.
"That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway!" said Percy, going very red in the
face. "It was nothing personal!"
"It was," Fred whispered to Harry as they got up from the table. "We sent it."
42CHAPTER SIX - THE PORTKEY
Harry felt as though he had barely lain down to steep in Ron's room when he was
being shaken awake by Mrs. Weasley.
"Time to go, Harry, dear," she whispered, moving away to wake Ron.
Harry felt around for his glasses, put them on, and sat up. It was still dark outside.
Ron muttered indistinctly as his mother roused him. At the foot of Harry's mattress
he saw two large, disheveled shapes emerging from tangles of blankets.
"'S' time already?" said Fred groggily.
They dressed in silence, too sleepy to talk, then, yawning and stretching, the four
of them headed downstairs into the kitchen.
Mrs. Weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot on the stove, while Mr.
Weasley was sitting at the table, checking a sheaf of large parchment tickets. He
looked up as the boys entered and spread his arms so that they could see his
clothes more clearly. He was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a
very old pair of jeans, slightly too big for him and held up with a thick leather belt.
"What d'you think?" he asked anxiously. "We're supposed to go incognito - do I
look like a Muggle, Harry?"
"Yeah," said Harry, smiling, "very good."
"Where're Bill and Charlie and Per-Per-Percy?" said George, failing to stifle a
huge yawn.
"Well, they're Apparating, aren't they?" said Mrs. Weasley, heaving the large pot
over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls. "So they can have a bit
of a lie-in."
Harry knew that Apparating meant disappearing from one place and reappearing
almost instantly in another, but had never known any Hogwarts student to do it,
and understood that it was very difficult.
"So they're still in bed?" said Fred grumpily, pulling his bowl of porridge toward
him. "Why can't we Apparate too?"
"Because you're not of age and you haven't passed your test," snapped Mrs.
Weasley. "And where have those girls got to?"
She bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the stairs.
"You have to pass a test to Apparate?" Harry asked.
43"Oh yes," said Mr. Weasley, tucking the tickets safely into the back pocket of his
jeans. "The Department of Magical Transportation had to fine a couple of people
the other day for Apparating without a license. It's not easy, Apparition, and when
it's not done property it can lead to nasty complications. This pair I'm talking about
went and splinched themselves."
Everyone around the table except Harry winced.
"Er - splinched?" said Harry.
"They left half of themselves behind," said Mr. Weasley, now spooning large
amounts of treacle onto his porridge. "So, of course, they were stuck. Couldn't
move either way. Had to wait for the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to sort
them out. Meant a fair old bit of paperwork, I can tell you, what with the Muggles
who spotted the body parts they'd left behind....."
Harry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an eyeball lying abandoned on the
pavement of Privet Drive.
"Were they okay?" he asked, startled.
"Oh yes," said Mr. Weasley matter-of-factly. "But they got a heavy fine, and I
don't think they'll be trying it again in a hurry. You don't mess around with
Apparition. There are plenty of adult wizards who don't bother with it. Prefer
brooms - slower, but safer."
"But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it?"
"Charlie had to take the test twice," said Fred, grinning. "He failed the first time.
Apparated five miles south of where he meant to, right on top of some poor old
dear doing her shopping, remember?"
"Yes, well, he passed the second time," said Mrs. Weasley, marching back into the
kitchen amid hearty sniggers.
"Percy only passed two weeks ago," said George. "He's been Apparating
downstairs every morning since, just to prove he can."
There were footsteps down the passageway and Hermione and Ginny came into
the kitchen, both looking pale and drowsy.
"Why do we have to be up so early?" Ginny said, rubbing her eyes and sitting
down at the table.
"We've got a bit of a walk," said Mr. Weasley.
"Walk?" said Harry. "What, are we walking to the World Cup?"
"No, no, that's miles away," said Mr. Weasley, smiling. "We only need to walk a
short way. It's just that it's very difficult for a large number of wizards to
congregate without attracting Muggle attention. We have to be very careful about
44how we travel at the best of times, and on a huge occasion like the Quidditch
World Cup..."
"George!" said Mrs. Weasley sharply, and they all jumped.
"What?" said George, in an innocent tone that deceived nobody.
"What is that in your pocket?"
"Nothing!"
"Don't you lie to me!"
Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at George's pocket and said, "Accio!"
Several small, brightly colored objects zoomed out of George's pocket; he made a
grab for them but missed, and they sped right into Mrs. Weasley's outstretched
hand.
"We told you to destroy them!" said Mrs. Weasley furiously, holding up what
were unmistakably more Ton-Tongue Toffees. "We told you to get rid of the lot!
Empty your pockets, go on, both of you!"
It was an unpleasant scene; the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle as
many toffees out of the house as possible, and it was only by using her
Summoning Charm that Mrs. Weasley managed to find them all.
"Accio! Accio! Accio!" she shouted, and toffees zoomed from all sorts of unlikely
places, including the lining of George's jacket and the turn-ups of Fred's jeans.
"We spent six months developing those!" Fred shouted at his mother as she threw
the toffees away.
"Oh a fine way to spend six months!" she shrieked. "No wonder you didn't get
more O.W.L.s!"
All in all, the atmosphere was not very friendly as they took their departure. Mrs.
Weasley was still glowering as she kissed Mr. Weasley on the cheek, though not
nearly as much as the twins, who had each hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs
and walked out without a word to her.
"Well, have a lovely time," said Mrs. Weasley, "and behave yourselves," she
called after the twins' retreating backs, but they did not look back or answer. "I'll
send Bill, Charlie, and Percy along around midday," Mrs. Weasley said to Mr.
Weasley, as he, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny set off across the dark yard
after Fred and George.
It was chilly and the moon was still out. Only a dull, greenish tinge along the
horizon to their right showed that daybreak was drawing closer. Harry, having
been thinking about thousands of wizards speeding toward the Quidditch World
Cup, sped up to walk with Mr. Weasley.
45"So how does everyone get there without all the Muggles noticing?" he asked.
"It's been a massive organizational problem," sighed Mr. Weasley. "The trouble is,
about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the World Cup, and of course, we just
haven't got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all. There are places
Muggles can't penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards
into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three-quarters. So we had to find a nice
deserted moor, and set up as many anti-Muggle precautions as possible. The whole
Ministry's been working on it for months. First, of course, we have to stagger the
arrivals. People with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand. A
limited number use Muggle transport, but we can't have too many clogging up
their buses and trains - remember, wizards are coming from all over the world.
Some Apparate, of course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear,
well away from Muggles. I believe there's a handy wood they're using as the
Apparition point. For those who don't want to Apparate, or can't, we use Portkeys.
They're objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a
prearranged time. You can do large groups at a time if you need to. There have
been two hundred Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain, and the
nearest one to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that's where we're headed."
Mr. Weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large black mass rose beyond the
village of Ottery St. Catchpole.
"What sort of objects are Portkeys?" said Harry curiously.
"Well, they can be anything," said Mr. Weasley. "Unobtrusive things, obviously,
so Muggles don't go picking them up and playing with them ... stuff they'll just
think is litter...."
They trudged down the dark, dank lane toward the village, the silence broken only
by their footsteps. The sky lightened very slowly as they made their way through
the village, its inky blackness diluting to deepest blue. Harry's hands and feet were
freezing. Mr. Weasley kept checking his watch.
They didn't have breath to spare for talking as they began to climb Stoatshead Hill,
stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit holes, slipping on thick black tuffets of
grass. Each breath Harry took was sharp in his chest and his legs were starting to
seize up when, at last, his feet found level ground.
"Whew," panted Mr. Weasley, taking off his glasses and wiping them on his
sweater. "Well, we've made good time - we've got ten minutes."
Hermione came over the crest of the hill last, clutching a stitch in her side.
"Now we just need the Portkey," said Mr. Weasley, replacing his glasses and
squinting around at the ground. "It won't be big.... Come on..."
They spread out, searching. They had only been at it for a couple of minutes,
however, when a shout rent the still air.
46"Over here, Arthur! Over here, son, we've got it."
Two tall figures were silhouetted against the starry sky on the other side of the
hilltop.
"Amos!" said Mr. Weasley, smiling as he strode over to the man who had shouted.
The rest of them followed.
Mr. Weasley was shaking hands with a ruddy-faced wizard with a scrubby brown
beard, who was holding a moldy-looking old boot in his other hand.
"This is Amos Diggory, everyone," said Mr. Weasley. "He works for the
Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. And I think you
know his son, Cedric?"
Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen. He was
Captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts.
"Hi," said Cedric, looking around at them all.
Everybody said hi back except Fred and George, who merely nodded. They had
never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their team, Gryffindor, in the first
Quidditch match of the previous year.
"Long walk, Arthur?" Cedric's father asked. "Not too bad," said Mr. Weasley. "We
live just on the other side of the village there. You?"
"Had to get up at two, didn't we, Ced? I tell you, I'll be glad when he's got his
Apparition test. Still ... not complaining ... Quidditch World Cup, wouldn't miss it
for a sackful of Galleons - and the tickets cost about that. Mind you, looks like I
got off easy. . . ." Amos Diggory peered good-naturedly around at the three
Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny. "All these yours, Arthur?"
"Oh no, only the redheads," said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his children. "This is
Hermione, friend of Ron's - and Harry, another friend -"
"Merlin's beard," said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening. "Harry? Harry Potter?"
"Er - yeah," said Harry.
Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him, used to the
way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it always
made him feel uncomfortable.
"Ced's talked about you, of course," said Amos Diggory. "Told us all about
playing against you last year... I said to him, I said - Ced, that'll be something to
tell your grandchildren, that will.... You beat Harry Potter!"
Harry couldn't think of any reply to this, so he remained silent. Fred and George
were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.
47"Harry fell off his broom, Dad," he muttered. I told you ... it was an accident...."
"Yes, but you didn't fall off, did you?" roared Amos genially, slapping his son on
his back. "Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman ... but the best man
won, I'm sure Harry'd say the same, wouldn't you, eh? One falls off his broom, one
stays on, you don't need to be a genius to tell which one's the better flier!"
"Must be nearly time," said Mr. Weasley quickly, pulling out his watch again. "Do
you know whether we're waiting for any more, Amos?"
"No, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts couldn't
get tickets," said Mr. Diggory. "There aren't any more of us in this area, are
there?"
"Not that I know of," said Mr. Weasley. "Yes, it's a minute off ... We'd better get
ready...."
He looked around at Harry and Hermione.
"You just need to touch the Portkey, that's all, a finger will do -"
With difficulty, owing to their bulky backpacks, the nine of them crowded around
the old boot held out by Amos Diggory.
They all stood there, in a tight circle, as a chill breeze swept over the hilltop.
Nobody spoke. It suddenly occurred to Harry how odd this would look if a
Muggle were to walk up here now ... nine people, two of them grown men,
clutching this manky old boot in the semidarkness, waiting....
"Three. . ." muttered Mr. Weasley, one eye still on his watch, two. . . one. . ."
It happened immediately: Harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had
been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward. His feet left the ground; he could feel
Ron and Hermione on either side of him, their shoulders banging into his; they
were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his forefinger was
stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then -
His feet slammed into the ground; Ron staggered into him and he fell over; the
Portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud.
Harry looked up. Mr. Weasley, Mr. Diggory, and Cedric were still standing,
though looking very windswept; everybody else was on the ground.
"Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill," said a voice.
48CHAPTER SEVEN - BAGMAN AND CROUCH
Harry disentangled himself from Ron and got to his feet. They had arrived on what
appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor. In front of them was a pair of
tired and grumpy-looking wizards, one of whom was holding a large gold watch,
the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill. Both were dressed as Muggles,
though very inexpertly: The man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thigh-
length galoshes; his colleague, a kilt and a poncho.
"Morning, Basil," said Mr. Weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to the
kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys beside him; Harry
could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can, and a punctured football.
"Hello there, Arthur," said Basil wearily. "Not on duty, eh? It's all right for
some.... We've been here all night.... You'd better get out of the way, we've got a
big party coming in from the Black Forest at five fifteen. Hang on, I'll find your
campsite.... Weasley ... Weasley...." He consulted his parchment list. "About a
quarter of a mile's walk over there, first field you come to. Site manager's called
Mr. Roberts. Diggory ... second field ... ask for Mr. Payne."
"Thanks, Basil," said Mr. Weasley, and he beckoned everyone to follow him.
They set off across the deserted moor, unable to make out much through the mist.
After about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view.
Beyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds
of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the
horizon. They said good-bye to the Diggorys and approached the cottage door.
A man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents. Harry knew at a
glance that this was the only real Muggle for several acres. When he heard their
footsteps, he turned his head to look at them.
"Morning!" said Mr. Weasley brightly.
"Morning," said the Muggle.
"Would you be Mr. Roberts?"
"Aye, I would," said Mr. Roberts. "And who're you?"
"Weasley - two tents, booked a couple of days ago?"
"Aye," said Mr. Roberts, consulting a list tacked to the door. "You've got a space
up by the wood there. Just the one night?"
"That's it," said Mr. Weasley.
"You'll be paying now, then?" said Mr. Roberts.
49"Ah - right - certainly -" said Mr. Weasley. He retreated a short distance from the
cottage and beckoned Harry toward him. "Help me, Harry," he muttered, pulling a
roll of Muggle money from his pocket and starting to peel the notes apart. "This
one's a - a - a ten? Ah yes, I see the little number on it now... So this is a five?"
"A twenty," Harry corrected him in an undertone, uncomfortably aware of Mr.
Roberts trying to catch every word.
"Ah yes, so it is.... I don't know, these little bits of paper..."
"You foreign?" said Mr. Roberts as Mr. Weasley returned with the correct notes.
"Foreign?" repeated Mr. Weasley, puzzled.
"You're not the first one who's had trouble with money," said Mr. Roberts,
scrutinizing Mr. Weasley closely. "I had two try and pay me with great gold coins
the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago."
"Did you really?" said Mr. Weasley nervously.
Mr. Roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change.
"Never been this crowded," he said suddenly, looking out over the misty field
again. "Hundreds of pre-bookings. People usually just turn up...."
"Is that right?" said Mr. Weasley, his hand held out for his change, but Mr.
Roberts didn't give it to him.
"Aye," he said thoughtfully. "People from all over. Loads of foreigners. And not
just foreigners. Weirdos, you know? There's a bloke walking 'round in a kilt and a
poncho."
"Shouldn't he?" said Mr. Weasley anxiously
"It's like some sort of... I dunno ... like some sort of rally," said Mr. Roberts. "They
all seem to know each other. Like a big party."
At that moment, a wizard in plus-fours appeared out of thin air next to Mr.
Roberts's front door.
"Obliviate!" he said sharply, pointing his wand at Mr. Roberts.
Instantly, Mr. Roberts's eyes slid out of focus, his brows unknitted, and a took of
dreamy unconcern fell over his face. Harry recognized the symptoms of one who
had just had his memory modified.
"A map of the campsite for you," Mr. Roberts said placidly to Mr. Weasley. "And
your change."
"Thanks very much," said Mr. Weasley.
The wizard in plus-fours accompanied them toward the gate to the campsite. He
50looked exhausted: His chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple
shadows under his eyes. Once out of earshot of Mr. Roberts, he muttered to Mr.
Weasley, "Been having a lot of trouble with him. Needs a Memory Charm ten
times a day to keep him happy. And Ludo Bagman's not helping. Trotting around
talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice, not a worry about anti-
Muggle security Blimey, I'll be glad when this is over. See you later, Arthur."
He Disapparated.
"I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports," said Ginny,
looking surprised. "He should know better than to talk about Bludgers near
Muggles, shouldn't he?"
"He should," said Mr. Weasley, smiling, and leading them through the gates into
the campsite, "but Ludo's always been a bit ... well . . . lax about security. You
couldn't wish for a more enthusiastic head of the sports department though. He
played Quidditch for England himself, you know. And he was the best Beater the
Wimbourne Wasps ever had."
They trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents. Most looked almost
ordinary; their owners had clearly tried to make them as Muggle-like as possible,
but had slipped up by adding chimneys, or bellpulls, or weather vanes. However,
here and there was a tent so obviously magical that Harry could hardly be
surprised that Mr. Roberts was getting suspicious. Halfway up the field stood an
extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace, with several live
peacocks tethered at the entrance. A little farther on they passed a tent that had
three floors and several turrets; and a short way beyond that was a tent that had a
front garden attached, complete with birdbath, sundial, and fountain.
"Always the same," said Mr. Weasley, smiling. "We can't resist showing off when
we get together. Ah, here we are, look, this is us."
They had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field, and here was
an empty space, with a small sign hammered into the ground that read WEEZLY.
"Couldn't have a better spot!" said Mr. Weasley happily. "The field is just on the
other side of the wood there, we're as close as we could be." He hoisted his
backpack from his shoulders. "Right," he said excitedly, "no magic allowed,
strictly speaking, not when we're out in these numbers on Muggle land. We'll be
putting these tents up by hand! Shouldn't be too difficult.... Muggles do it all the
time.... Here, Harry, where do you reckon we should start?"
Harry had never been camping in his life; the Dursleys had never taken him on
any kind of holiday, preferring to leave him with Mrs. Figg, an old neighbor.
However, he and Hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should
go, and though Mr. Weasley was more of a hindrance than a help, because he got
thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet, they finally managed to
erect a pair of shabby two-man tents.
51All of them stood back to admire their handiwork. Nobody looking at these tents
would guess they belonged to wizards, Harry thought, but the trouble was that
once Bill, Charlie, and Percy arrived, they would be a party of ten. Hermione
seemed to have spotted this problem too; she gave Harry a quizzical look as Mr.
Weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent.
"We'll be a bit cramped," he called, "but I think we'll all squeeze in. Come and
have a look."
Harry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt his jaw drop. He had walked
into what looked like an old-fashioned, three room flat, complete with bathroom
and kitchen. Oddly enough, it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as
Mrs. Figg's house: There were crocheted covers on the mismatched chairs and a
strong smell of cats.
"Well, it's not for long," said Mr. Weasley, mopping his bald patch with a
handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom. I
borrowed this from Perkins at the office. Doesn't camp much anymore, poor
fellow, he's got lumbago."
He picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it. "We'll need water....
"There's a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave us," said Ron, who had
followed Harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its
extraordinary inner proportions. "It's on the other side of the field."
"Well, why don't you, Harry, and Hermione go and get us some water then" - Mr.
Weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans - "and the rest of us will
get some wood for a fire?"
"But we've got an oven," said Ron. "Why can't we just -"
"Ron, anti-Muggle security!" said Mr. Weasley, his face shining with anticipation.
"When real Muggles camp, they cook on fires outdoors. I've seen them at it!"
After a quick tour of the girls' tent, which was slightly smaller than the boys',
though without the smell of cats, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off across the
campsite with the kettle and saucepans.
Now, with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting, they could see the city of tents
that stretched in every direction. They made their way slowly through the rows,
staring eagerly around. It was only just dawning on Harry how many witches and
wizards there must be in the world; he had never really thought much about those
in other countries.
Their fellow campers were starting to wake up. First to stir were the families with
small children; Harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before. A
tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid-shaped tent,
holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling
52slowly to the size of a salami. As they drew level with him, his mother came
hurrying out of the tent.
"How many times, Kevin? You don't - touch - Daddy's - wand - yecchh! "
She had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her scolding carried after them on
the still air, mingling with the little boy's yells - "You bust slug! You bust slug!"
A short way farther on, they saw two little witches, barely older than Kevin, who
were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls' toes to skim
the dewy grass. A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past
Harry, Ron, and Hermione he muttered distractedly, "In broad daylight! Parents
having a lie-in, I suppose -"
Here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and
starting to cook breakfast. Some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires
with their wands; others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces,
as though sure this couldn't work. Three African wizards sat in serious
conversation, all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a
rabbit on a bright purple fire, while a group of middle-aged American witches sat
gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their tents that
read: THE SALEM WITCHES' INSTITUTE. Harry caught snatches of
conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed, and though
he couldn't understand a word, the tone of every single voice was excited.
"Er - is it my eyes, or has everything gone green?" said Ron.
It wasn't just Ron's eyes. They had walked into a patch of tents that were all
covered with a thick growth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though small, oddly
shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth. Grinning faces could be seen under
those that had their flaps open. Then, from behind them, they heard their names.
"Harry! Ron! Hermione!"
It was Seamus Finnigan, their fellow Gryffindor fourth year. He was sitting in
front of his own shamrock-covered tent, with a sandy-haired woman who had to
be his mother, and his best friend, Dean Thomas, also of Gryffindor.
"Like the decorations?" said Seamus, grinning. "The Ministry's not too happy."
"Ah, why shouldn't we show our colors?" said Mrs. Finnigan. "You should see
what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents. You'll be supporting
Ireland, of course?" she added, eyeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione beadily. When
they had assured her that they were indeed supporting Ireland, they set off again,
though, as Ron said, "Like we'd say anything else surrounded by that lot." I
wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents?" said
Hermione.
"Let's go and have a look," said Harry, pointing to a large patch of tents upfield,
53where the Bulgarian flag - white, green, and red - was fluttering in the breeze.
The tents here had not been bedecked with plant life, but each and every one of
them had the same poster attached to it, a poster of a very surly face with heavy
black eyebrows. The picture was, of course, moving, but all it did was blink and
scowl.
"Krum," said Ron quietly.
"What?" said Hermione.
"Krum!" said Ron. "Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker!"
"He looks really grumpy," said Hermione, looking around at the many Krums
blinking and scowling at them.
"'Really grumpy?" Ron raised his eyes to the heavens. "Who cares what he looks
like? He's unbelievable. He's really young too. Only just eighteen or something.
He's a genius, you wait until tonight, you'll see."
There was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field. Harry, Ron,
and Hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated
argument. One of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery
nightgown. The other was clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding out a pair of
pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.
"Just put them on, Archie, there's a good chap. You can't walk around like that, the
Muggle at the gate's already getting suspicious -
I bought this in a Muggle shop," said the old wizard stubbornly. "Muggles wear
them."
"Muggle women wear them, Archie, not the men, they wear these," said the
Ministry wizard, and he brandished the pinstriped trousers.
"I'm not putting them on," said old Archie in indignation. "I like a healthy breeze
'round my privates, thanks."
Hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she
had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected his
water and moved away.
Walking more slowly now, because of the weight of the water, they made their
way back through the campsite. Here and there, they saw more familiar faces:
other Hogwarts students with their families. Oliver Wood, the old captain of
Harry's House Quidditch team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged Harry over to
his parents' tent to introduce him, and told him excitedly that he had just been
signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team. Next they were hailed by Ernie
Macmillan, a Hufflepuff fourth year, and a little farther on they saw Cho Chang, a
very pretty girl who played Seeker on the Ravenclaw team. She waved and smiled
54at Harry, who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he waved back. More
to stop Ron from smirking than anything, Harry hurriedly pointed out a large
group of teenagers whom he had never seen before.
"Who d'you reckon they are?" he said. "They don't go to Hogwarts, do they?"
"'Spect they go to some foreign school," said Ron. "I know there are others. Never
met anyone who went to one, though. Bill had a penfriend at a school in Brazil ...
this was years and years ago ... and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but Mum
and Dad couldn't afford it. His penfriend got all offended when he said he wasn't
going and sent him a cursed hat. It made his ears shrivel up."
Harry laughed but didn't voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other
wizarding schools. He supposed, now that he saw representatives of so many
nationalities in the campsite, that he had been stupid never to realize that Hogwarts
couldn't be the only one. He glanced at Hermione, who looked utterly unsurprised
by the information. No doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding
schools in some book or other.
"You've been ages," said George when they finally got back to the Weasleys' tents.
"Met a few people," said Ron, setting the water down. "You've not got that fire
started yet?"
"Dad's having fun with the matches," said Fred.
Mr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but it wasn't for lack
of trying. Splintered matches littered the ground around him, but he looked as
though he was having the time of his life.
"Oops!" he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in
surprise.
"Come here, Mr. Weasley," said Hermione kindly, taking the box from him, and
showing him how to do it properly.
At last they got the fire lit, though it was at least another hour before it was hot
enough to cook anything. There was plenty to watch while they waited, however.
Their tent seemed to be pitched right alongside a kind of thoroughfare to the field,
and Ministry members kept hurrying up and down it, greeting Mr. Weasley
cordially as they passed. Mr. Weasley kept up a running commentary, mainly for
Harry's and Hermione's benefit; his own children knew too much about the
Ministry to be greatly interested.
"That was Cuthbert Mockridge, Head of the Goblin Liaison Office.... Here comes
Gilbert Wimple; he's with the Committee on Experimental Charms; he's had those
horns for a while now... Hello, Arnie ... Arnold Peasegood, he's an Obliviator -
member of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, you know... and that's Bode and
Croaker ... they're Unspeakables...."
55"They're what?"
"From the Department of Mysteries, top secret, no idea what they get up to...."
At last, the fire was ready, and they had just started cooking eggs and sausages
when Bill, Charlie, and Percy came strolling out of the woods toward them.
"Just Apparated, Dad," said Percy loudly. "Ah, excellent, lunch!"
They were halfway through their plates of eggs and sausages when Mr. Weasley
jumped to his feet, waving and grinning at a man who was striding toward them.
"Aha!" he said. "The man of the moment! Ludo!"
Ludo Bagman was easily the most noticeable person Harry had seen so far, even
including old Archie in his flowered nightdress. He was wearing long Quidditch
robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright yellow and black. An enormous picture
of a wasp was splashed across his chest. He had the look of a powerfully built man
gone slightly to seed; the robes were stretched tightly across a large belly he surely
had not had in the days when he had played Quidditch for England. His nose was
squashed (probably broken by a stray Bludger, Harry thought), but his round blue
eyes, short blond hair, and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown
schoolboy.
"Ahoy there!" Bagman called happily. He was walking as though he had springs
attached to the balls of his feet and was plainly in a state of wild excitement.
"Arthur, old man," he puffed as he reached the campfire, "what a day, eh? What a
day! Could we have asked for more perfect weather? A cloudless night coming ...
and hardly a hiccough in the arrangements.... Not much for me to do!"
Behind him, a group of haggard-looking Ministry wizards rushed past, pointing at
the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet sparks
twenty feet into the air.
Percy hurried forward with his hand outstretched. Apparently his disapproval of
the way Ludo Bagman ran his department did not prevent him from wanting to
make a good impression.
"Ah - yes," said Mr. Weasley, grinning, "this is my son Percy. He's just started at
the Ministry - and this is Fred - no, George, sorry - that's Fred - Bill, Charlie, Ron
- my daughter, Ginny and Ron's friends, Hermione Granger and Harry Potter."
Bagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard Harry's name, and his
eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on Harry's forehead.
"Everyone," Mr. Weasley continued, "this is Ludo Bagman, you know who he is,
it's thanks to him we've got such good tickets -"
Bagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothing.
56"Fancy a flutter on the match, Arthur?" he said eagerly, jingling what seemed to be
a large amount of gold in the pockets of his yellow-and-black robes. "I've already
got Roddy Pontner betting me Bulgaria will score first - I offered him nice odds,
considering Ireland's front three are the strongest I've seen in years - and little
Agatha Timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a weeklong match."
"Oh ... go on then," said Mr. Weasley. "Let's see ... a Galleon on Ireland to win?"
"A Galleon?" Ludo Bagman looked slightly disappointed, but recovered himself.
"Very well, very well ... any other takers?"
"They're a bit young to be gambling," said Mr. Weasley. "Molly wouldn't like -"
"We'll bet thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, three Knuts," said Fred as he and
George quickly pooled all their money, "that Ireland wins - but Viktor Krum gets
the Snitch. Oh and we'll throw in a fake wand."
"You don't want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish like that," Percy hissed, but
Bagman didn't seem to think the wand was rubbish at all; on the contrary, his
boyish face shone with excitement as he took it from Fred, and when the wand
gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken, Bagman roared with
laughter.
"Excellent! I haven't seen one that convincing in years! I'd pay five Galleons for
that!"
Percy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval.
"Boys," said Mr. Weasley under his breath, "I don't want you betting.... That's all
your savings .... Your mother -"
"Don't be a spoilsport, Arthur!" boomed Ludo Bagman, rattling his pockets
excitedly. "They're old enough to know what they want! You reckon Ireland will
win but Krum'll get the Snitch? Not a chance, boys, not a chance.... I'll give you
excellent odds on that one .... We'll add five Galleons for the funny wand, then,
shall we...."
Mr. Weasley looked on helplessly as Ludo Bagman whipped out a notebook and
quill and began jotting down the twins' names.
"Cheers," said George, taking the slip of parchment Bagman handed him and
tucking it away into the front of his robes. Bagman turned most cheerfully back to
Mr. Weasley.
"Couldn't do me a brew, I suppose? I'm keeping an eye out for Barty Crouch. My
Bulgarian opposite number's making difficulties, and I can't understand a word
he's saying. Barty'll be able to sort it out. He speaks about a hundred and fifty
languages."
"Mr. Crouch?" said Percy, suddenly abandoning his look of poker-stiff
57disapproval and positively writhing with excitement. "He speaks over two
hundred! Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll. . ."
"Anyone can speak Troll," said Fred dismissively. "All you have to do is point and
grunt."
Percy threw Fred an extremely nasty look and stoked the fire vigorously to bring
the kettle back to the boil.
"Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet, Ludo?" Mr. Weasley asked as Bagman settled
himself down on the grass beside them all.
"Not a dicky bird," said Bagman comfortably. "But she'll turn up. Poor old Bertha
... memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction. Lost, you take my word
for it. She'll wander back into the office sometime in October, thinking it's still
July."
"You don't think it might be time to send someone to look for her?" Mr. Weasley
suggested tentatively as Percy handed Bagman his tea.
"Barty Crouch keeps saying that," said Bagman, his round eyes widening
innocently, "but we really can't spare anyone at the moment. Oh - talk of the devil!
Barty!"
A wizard had just Apparated at their fireside, and he could not have made more of
a contrast with Ludo Bagman, sprawled on the grass in his old Wasp robes. Barty
Crouch was a stiff, upright, elderly man, dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and
tie. The parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight, and his
narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide rule. His
shoes were very highly polished. Harry could see at once why Percy idolized him.
Percy was a great believer in rigidly following rules, and Mr. Crouch had
complied with the rule about Muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have
passed for a bank manager; Harry doubted even Uncle Vernon would have spotted
him for what he really was.
"Pull up a bit of grass, Barry," said Ludo brightly, patting the ground beside him.
"No thank you, Ludo," said Crouch, and there was a bite of impatience in his
voice. "I've been looking for you everywhere. The Bulgarians are insisting we add
another twelve seats to the Top Box."
"Oh is that what they're after?" said Bagman. I thought the chap was asking to
borrow a pair of tweezers. Bit of a strong accent."
"Mr. Crouch!" said Percy breathlessly, sunk into a kind of halfbow that made him
look like a hunchback. "Would you like a cup of tea?"
"Oh," said Mr. Crouch, looking over at Percy in mild surprise. "Yes - thank you,
Weatherby."
58Fred and George choked into their own cups. Percy, very pink around the ears,
busied himself with the kettle.
"Oh and I've been wanting a word with you too, Arthur," said Mr. Crouch, his
sharp eyes falling upon Mr. Weasley. "Ali Bashir's on the warpath. He wants a
word with you about your embargo on flying carpets."
Mr. Weasley heaved a deep sigh.
"I sent him an owl about that just last week. If I've told him once I've told him a
hundred times: Carpets are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of
Proscribed Charmable Objects, but will he listen?"
"I doubt it," said Mr. Crouch, accepting a cup from Percy. "He's desperate to
export here."
"Well, they'll never replace brooms in Britain, will they?" said Bagman.
"Ali thinks there's a niche in the market for a family vehicle, said Mr. Crouch. "I
remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve - but that was
before carpets were banned, of course."
He spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his ancestors
had abided strictly by the law.
"So, been keeping busy, Barty?" said Bagman breezily.
"Fairly," said Mr. Crouch dryly. "Organizing Portkeys across five continents is no
mean feat, Ludo."
"I expect you'll both be glad when this is over?" said Mr. Weasley.
Ludo Bagman looked shocked.
"Glad! Don't know when I've had more fun.... Still, it's not as though we haven't
got anything to took forward to, eh, Barty? Eh? Plenty left to organize, eh?"
Mr. Crouch raised his eyebrows at Bagman.
"We agreed not to make the announcement until all the details -"
"Oh details!" said Bagman, waving the word away like a cloud of midges.
"They've signed, haven't they? They've agreed, haven't they? I bet you anything
these kids'll know soon enough anyway. I mean, it's happening at Hogwarts -"
"Ludo, we need to meet the Bulgarians, you know," said Mr. Crouch sharply,
cutting Bagman's remarks short. "Thank you for the tea, Weatherby."
He pushed his undrunk tea back at Percy and waited for Ludo to rise; Bagman
struggled to his feet, swigging down the last of his tea, the gold in his pockets
chinking merrily.
59"See you all later!" he said. "You'll be up in the Top Box with me - I'm
commentating!" He waved, Barty Crouch nodded curtly, and both of them
Disapparated.
"What's happening at Hogwarts, Dad?" said Fred at once. "What were they talking
about?"
"You'll find out soon enough," said Mr.Weasley, smiling.
"It's classified information, until such time as the Ministry decides to release it,"
said Percy stiffly. "Mr. Crouch was quite right not to disclose it."
"Oh shut up, Weatherby," said Fred.
A sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the
afternoon wore on. By dusk, the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with
anticipation, and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of waiting
wizards, the last vestiges of pretence disappeared: the Ministry seemed to have
bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now
breaking out everywhere.
Salesmen were Apparating every few feet, carrying trays and pushing carts full of
extraordinary merchandise. There were luminous rosettes - green for Ireland, red
for Bulgaria - which were squealing the names of the players, pointed green hats
bedecked with dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that
really roared, flags from both countries that played their national anthems as they
were waved; there were tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible
figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening
themselves.
"Been saving my pocket money all summer for this," Ron told Harry as they and
Hermione strolled through the salesmen, buying souvenirs. Though Ron purchased
a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette, he also bought a small figure of
Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker. The miniature Krum walked backward and
forward over Ron's hand, scowling up at the green rosette above him.
"Wow, look at these!" said Harry, hurrying over to a cart piled high with what
looked like brass binoculars, except that they were covered with all sorts of weird
knobs and dials.
"Omnioculars," said the saleswizard eagerly. "You can replay action ... slow
everything down ... and they flash up a play-by- play breakdown if you need it.
Bargain - ten Galleons each."
"Wish I hadn't bought this now," said Ron, gesturing at his dancing shamrock hat
and gazing longingly at the Omnioculars.
"Three pairs," said Harry firmly to the wizard.
"No - don't bother," said Ron, going red. He was always touchy about the fact that
60Harry, who had inherited a small fortune from his parents, had much more money
than he did.
"You won't be getting anything for Christmas," Harry told him, thrusting
Omnioculars into his and Hermione's hands. "For about ten years, mind."
"Fair enough," said Ron, grinning.
"Oooh, thanks, Harry," said Hermione. "And I'll get us some programs, look -"
Their money bags considerably lighter, they went back to the tents. Bill, Charlie,
and Ginny were all sporting green rosettes too, and Mr. Weasley was carrying an
Irish flag. Fred and George had no souvenirs as they had given Bagman all their
gold.
And then a deep, booming gong sounded somewhere beyond the woods, and at
once, green and red lanterns blazed into life in the trees, lighting a path to the
field.
"It's time!" said Mr. Weasley, looking as excited as any of them. "Come on, let's
go!"
61CHAPTER EIGHT - THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP
Clutching their purchases, Mr. Weasley in the lead, they all hurried into the wood,
following the lantern-lit trail. They could hear the sounds of thousands of people
moving around them, shouts and laughter, snatches of singing. The atmosphere of
feverish excitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn't stop grinning. They
walked through the wood for twenty minutes, talking and joking loudly, until at
last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a
gigantic stadium. Though Harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold
walls surrounding the field, he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably
inside it.
"Seats a hundred thousand," said Mr. Weasley, spotting the awestruck look on
Harry's face. "Ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year.
Muggle Repelling Charms on every inch of it. Every time Muggles have got
anywhere near here all year, they've suddenly remembered urgent appointments
and had to dash away again ... bless them," he added fondly, leading the way
toward the nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a swarm of
shouting witches and wizards.
"Prime seats!" said the Ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their
tickets. "Top Box! Straight upstairs, Arthur, and as high as you can go."
The stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple. They clambered upward
with the rest of the crowd, which slowly filtered away through doors into the
stands to their left and right. Mr. Weasley's party kept climbing, and at last they
reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box, set at the
highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal
posts. About twenty purple-and-gilt chairs stood in two rows here, and Harry,
filing into the front seats with the Weasleys, looked down upon a scene the likes of
which he could never have imagined.
A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats,
which rose in levels around the long oval field. Everything was suffused with a
mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself. The field
looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position. At either end of the field stood
three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite them, almost at Harry's eye level,
was a gigantic blackboard. Gold writing kept dashing across it as though an
invisible giant's hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off
again; watching it, Harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field.
The Bluebottle: A Broom for All the Family - safe, reliable, and with Built-in
Anti-Burgler Buzzer ... Mrs. Shower's All Purpose Magical Mess Remover: No
Pain, No Stain! ... Gladrags Wizardwear - London, Paris, Hogsmeade...
62Harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who
else was sharing the box with them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny creature
sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them. The creature,
whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair, was wearing a
tea towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in its hands. Yet those long,
batlike ears were oddly familiar....
"Dobby?" said Harry incredulously.
The tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing enormous brown
eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato. It wasn't Dobby - it
was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry's friend Dobby had been. Harry
had set Dobby free from his old owners, the Malfoy family.
"Did sir just call me Dobby?" squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers.
Its voice was higher even than Dobby's had been, a teeny, quivering squeak of a
voice, and Harry suspected though it was very hard to tell with a house-elf - that
this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to
look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never
actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest.
"Sorry," Harry told the elf, "I just thought you were someone I knew."
"But I knows Dobby too, sir!" squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face, as
though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not brightly lit. "My name is
Winky, sir - and you, sir -" Her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates
as they rested upon Harry's scar. "You is surely Harry Potter!"
"Yeah, I am," said Harry.
"But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!" s he said, lowering her hands very
slightly and looking awestruck.
"How is he?" said Harry. "How's freedom suiting him?"
"Ah, sir," said Winky, shaking her head, "ah sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but I is
not sure you did Dobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free."
"Why?" said Harry, taken aback. "What's wrong with him?"
"Freedom is going to Dobby's head, sir, " said Winky sadly. "Ideas above his
station, sir. Can't get another position, sir."
"Why not?" said Harry.
Winky lowered her voice by a half-octave and whispered, "He is wanting paying
for his work, sir."
"Paying?" said Harry blankly. "Well - why shouldn't he be paid?"
Winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her
63face was half-hidden again.
"House-elves is not paid, sir!" she said in a muffled squeak. "No, no, no. I says to
Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby. He is
getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-elf. You
goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear you's up in
front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, like
some common goblin."
"Well, it's about time he had a bit of fun," said Harry.
"House-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry Potter," said Winky firmly, from
behind her hands. "House-elves does what they is told. I is not liking heights at all,
Harry Potter" - she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped - "but my
master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir."
"Why's he sent you up here, if he knows you don't like heights?" said Harry,
frowning.
"Master - master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very busy," said
Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her. "Winky is wishing she
is back in master's tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does what she is told. Winky is a
good house-elf."
She gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes completely
again. Harry turned back to the others.
"So that's a house-elf?" Ron muttered. "Weird things, aren't they?"
"Dobby was weirder," said Harry fervently.
Ron pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into the
crowd on the other side of the stadium.
"Wild!" he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. I can make that old bloke
down there pick his nose again ... and again ... and again. . ."
Hermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through her velvetcovered, tasseled
program.
"'A display from the team mascots will precede the match,"' she read aloud.
"Oh that's always worth watching," said Mr. Weasley. "National teams bring
creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show."
The box filled gradually around them over the next half hour. Mr. Weasley kept
shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards. Percy
jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a
hedgehog. When Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself, arrived, Percy
bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered. Highly embarrassed, he
64repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat, throwing jealous
looks at Harry, whom Cornelius Fudge had greeted like an old friend. They had
met before, and Fudge shook Harry's hand in a fatherly fashion, asked how he
was, and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him.
"Harry Potter, you know," he told the Bulgarian minister loudly, who was wearing
splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didn't seem to understand a
word of English. "Harry Potter ... oh come on now, you know who he is ... the boy
who survived You-Know-Who ... you do know who he is -"
The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry's scar and started gabbling loudly
and excitedly, pointing at it.
"Knew we'd get there in the end," said Fudge wearily to Harry. "I'm no great
shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see his house-
elf's saving him a seat.... Good job too, these Bulgarian blighters have been trying
to cadge all the best places ... ah, and here's Lucius!"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging along the second row to three
still-empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby the house-
elf's former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman Harry supposed
must be Draco's mother.
Harry and Draco Malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first journey to
Hogwarts. A pale boy with a pointed face and white-blond hair, Draco greatly
resembled his father. His mother was blonde too; tall and slim, she would have
been nice-looking if she hadn't been wearing a look that suggested there was a
nasty smell under her nose.
"Ah, Fudge," said Mr. Malfoy, holding out his hand as he reached the Minister of
Magic. "How are you? I don't think you've met my wife, Narcissa? Or our son,
Draco?"
"How do you do, how do you do?" said Fudge, smiling and bowing to Mrs.
Malfoy. "And allow me to introduce you to Mr. Oblansk - Obalonsk - Mr. - well,
he's the Bulgarian Minister of Magic, and he can't understand a word I'm saying
anyway, so never mind. And let's see who else - you know Arthur Weasley, I
daresay?"
It was a tense moment. Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy looked at each other and
Harry vividly recalled the last time they had come face-to-face: It had been in
Flourish and Blotts' bookshop, and they had had a fight. Mr. Malfoy's cold gray
eyes swept over Mr. Weasley, and then up and down the row.
"Good lord, Arthur," he said softly. "What did you have to sell to get seats in the
Top Box? Surely your house wouldn't have fetched this much?"
Fudge, who wasn't listening, said, "Lucius has just given a very generous
contribution to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Arthur.
65He's here as my guest."
"How - how nice," said Mr. Weasley, with a very strained smile.
Mr. Malfoy's eyes had returned to Hermione, who went slightly pink, but stared
determinedly back at him. Harry knew exactly what was making Mr. Malfoy's lip
curl like that. The Malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods; in other words,
they considered anyone of Muggle descent, like Hermione, second-class.
However, under the gaze of the Minister of Magic, Mr. Malfoy didn't dare say
anything. He nodded sneeringly to Mr. Weasley and continued down the line to
his seats. Draco shot Harry, Ron, and Hermione one contemptuous look, then
settled himself between his mother and father.
"Slimy gits," Ron muttered as he, Harry, and Hermione turned to face the field
again. Next moment, Ludo Bagman charged into the box.
"Everyone ready?" he said, his round face gleaming like a great, excited Edam.
"Minister - ready to go?"
"Ready when you are, Ludo," said Fudge comfortably.
Ludo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat, and said "Sonorus!" and
then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium; his
voice echoed over them, booming into every corner of the stands.
"Ladies and gentlemen. . . welcome! Welcome to the final of the four hundred and
twenty-second Quidditch World Cup!"
The spectators screamed and clapped. Thousands of flags waved, adding their
discordant national anthems to the racket. The huge blackboard opposite them was
wiped clear of its last message (Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans - A Risk With
Every Mouthful!) and now showed BULGARIA: 0, IRELAND: 0.
"And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce. . . the Bulgarian National
Team Mascots!"
The right-hand side of the stands, which was a solid block of scarlet, roared its
approval.
"I wonder what they've brought," said Mr. Weasley, leaning forward in his seat.
"Aaah!" He suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his
robes. "Veela!"
"What are veel -?"
But a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and Harry's question was
answered for him. Veela were women. . . the most beautiful women Harry had
ever seen. . . except that they weren't - they couldn't be - human. This puzzled
Harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could
make their skin shine moon-bright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out behind
66them without wind.. . but then the music started, and Harry stopped worrying
about them not being human - in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all.
The veela had started to dance, and Harry's mind had gone completely and
blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the
veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen.
And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started
chasing through Harry's dazed mind. He wanted to do something very impressive,
right now. Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea. . . but
would it be good enough?
"Harry, what are you doing?" said Hermione's voice from a long way off.
The music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing up, and one of his legs was
resting on the wall of the box. Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that
looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard.
Angry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn't want the veela to go. Harry
was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered
vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest. Ron, meanwhile,
was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr. Weasley, smiling
slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his hands.
"You'll be wanting that," he said, "once Ireland have had their say."
"Huh?" said Ron, staring openmouthed at the veela, who had now lined up along
one side of the field.
Hermione made a loud tutting noise. She reached up and pulled Harry back into
his seat. "Honestly!" she said.
"And now," roared Ludo Bagman's voice, "kindly put your wands in the air. . . for
the Irish National Team Mascots!"
Next moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-gold comet came zooming
into the stadium. It did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two smaller
comets, each hurtling toward the goal posts. A rainbow arced suddenly across the
field, connecting the two balls of light. The crowd oooohed and aaaaahed, as
though at a fireworks display. Now the rainbow faded and the balls of light
reunited and merged; they had formed a great shimmering shamrock, which rose
up into the sky and began to soar over the stands. Something like golden rain
seemed to be falling from it - "Excellent!" yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over
them, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats.
Squinting up at the shamrock, Harry realized that it was actually comprised of
thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of
gold or green.
"Leprechauns!" said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd,
67many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to
retrieve the gold.
"There you go," Ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold coins into Harry's
hand, "for the Omnioculars! Now you've got to buy me a Christmas present, ha!"
The great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the
opposite side from the veela, and settled themselves cross-legged to watch the
match.
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome - the Bulgarian National
Quidditch Team! I give you - Dimitrov!"
A scarlet-clad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast it was blurred, shot out onto
the field from an entrance far below, to wild applause from the Bulgarian
supporters.
"Ivanova!"
A second scarlet-robed player zoomed out.
"Zograf! Levski! Vulchanov! Volkov! Aaaaaaand - Krum!"
"That's him, that's him!" yelled Ron, following Krum with his Omnioculars. Harry
quickly focused his own.
Viktor Krum was thin, dark, and sallow-skinned, with a large curved nose and
thick black eyebrows. He looked like an overgrown bird of prey. It was hard to
believe he was only eighteen.
"And now, please greet - the Irish National Quidditch Team!" yelled Bagman.
"Presenting - Connolly! Ryan! Troy! Mullet! Moran! Quigley! Aaaaaand -
Lynch!"
Seven green blurs swept onto the field; Harry spun a small dial on the side of his
Omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word "Firebolt" on
each of their brooms and see their names, embroidered in silver, upon their backs.
"And here, all the way from Egypt, our referee, acclaimed Chairwizard of the
International Association of Quidditch, Hassan Mostafa!"
A small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with a mustache to rival Uncle
Vernon's, wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the
field. A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and he was
carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the other.
Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as
Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open - four balls burst into
the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for the
briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch.
With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls.
68"Theeeeeeeey're OFF!" screamed Bagman. "And it's Mullet! Troy! Moran!
Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran!"
It was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He was pressing his
Omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his
nose. The speed of the players was incredible - the Chasers were throwing the
Quaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names.
Harry spun the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again, pressed the play-
by-play button on the top, and he was immediately watching in slow motion, while
glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd
pounded against his eardrums.
HAWKSHEAD ATTACKING FORMATION, he read as he watched the three
Irish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet
and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians. PORSKOFF PLOY flashed up
next, as Troy made as though to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the
Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran. One of the
Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small club,
knocking it into Moran's path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and dropped
the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it - "TROY SCORES!" roared
Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers. "Ten zero
to Ireland!"
"What?" Harry yelled, looking wildly around through his Omnioculars. "But
Levski's got the Quaffle!"
"Harry, if you're not going to watch at normal speed, you're going to miss things!"
shouted Hermione, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air
while Troy did a lap of honor around the field. Harry looked quickly over the top
of his Omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had
all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering shamrock. Across the
field, the veela were watching them sulkily.
Furious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed.
Harry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the Irish Chasers were superb.
They worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated that they
appeared to be reading one another's minds as they positioned themselves, and the
rosette on Harry's chest kept squeaking their names: "Troy - Mullet - Mo ran!"
And within ten minutes, Ireland had scored twice more, bringing their lead to
thirty-zero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the green-
clad supporters.
The match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and Vulchanov, the
Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish
Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves;
twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break
through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria's first goal.
69"Fingers in your ears!" bellowed Mr. Weasley as the veela started to dance in
celebration. Harry screwed up his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the
game. After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the field. The veela had stopped
dancing, and Bulgaria was again in possession of the Quaffle.
"Dimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova - oh I say!" roared Bagman.
One hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two Seekers, Krum and Lynch,
plummeted through the center of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as though they
had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes. Harry followed their descent
through his Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was -
"They're going to crash!" screamed Hermione next to Harry.
She was half right - at the very last second, Viktor Krum pulled out of the dive and
spiraled off. Lynch, however, hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard
throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose from the Irish seats.
"Fool!" moaned Mr. Weasley. "Krum was feinting!"
"It's time-out!" yelled Bagman's voice, "as trained mediwizards hurry onto the
field to examine Aidan Lynch!"
"He'll be okay, he only got ploughed!" Charlie said reassuringly to Ginny, who
was hanging over the side of the box, looking horror-struck. "Which is what Krum
was after, of course... ."
Harry hastily pressed the replay and play-by-play buttons on his Omnioculars,
twiddled the speed dial, and put them back up to his eyes.
He watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow motion. WRONSKI
DEFENSIVE FEINT - DANGEROUS SEEKER DIVERSION read the shining
purple lettering across his lenses. He saw Krum's face contorted with
concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time, while Lynch was flattened,
and he understood - Krum hadn't seen the Snitch at all, he was just making Lynch
copy him. Harry had never seen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as
though he was using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily through the air that he
looked unsupported and weightless. Harry turned his Omnioculars back to normal
and focused them on Krum. He was now circling high above Lynch, who was
being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion. Harry, focusing still more
closely upon Krum's face, saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred
feet below. He was using the time while Lynch was revived to look for the Snitch
without interference.
Lynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the green-clad supporters,
mounted his Firebolt, and kicked back off into the air. His revival seemed to give
Ireland new heart. When Mostafa blew his whistle again, the Chasers moved into
action with a skill unrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far.
70After fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland had pulled ahead by ten more
goals. They were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten, and the
game was starting to get dirtier.
As Mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again, clutching the Quaffle tightly under
her arm, the Bulgarian Keeper, Zograf, flew out to meet her. Whatever happened
was over so quickly Harry didn't catch it, but a scream of rage from the Irish
crowd, and Mostafa's long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a foul.
"And Mostafa takes the Bulgarian Keeper to task for cobbing -- excessive use of
elbows!" Bagman informed the roaring spectators. "And - yes, it's a penalty to
Ireland!"
The leprechauns, who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering
hornets when Mullet had been fouled, now darted together to form the words "HA,
HA, HA!" The veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet, tossed their
hair angrily, and started to dance again.
As one, the Weasley boys and Harry stuffed their fingers into their ears, but
Hermione, who hadn't bothered, was soon tugging on Harry's arm. He turned to
look at her, and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears.
"Look at the referee!" she said, giggling.
Harry looked down at the field. Hassan Mostafa had landed right in front of the
dancing veela, and was acting very oddly indeed. He was flexing his muscles and
smoothing his mustache excitedly.
"Now, we can't have that!" said Ludo Bagman, though he sounded highly amused.
"Somebody slap the referee!"
A mediwizard came tearing across the field, his fingers stuffed into his own ears,
and kicked Mostafa hard in the shins. Mostafa seemed to come to himself; Harry,
watching through the Omnioculars again, saw that he looked exceptionally
embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela, who had stopped dancing and
were looking mutinous.
"And unless I'm much mistaken, Mostafa is actually attempting to send off the
Bulgarian team mascots!" said Bagman's voice. "Now there's something we
haven't seen before. . . . Oh this could turn nasty. . .
It did: The Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov and Vulchanov, landed on either side of
Mostafa and began arguing furiously with him, gesticulating toward the
leprechauns, who had now gleefully formed the words "HEE, HEE, HEE."
Mostafa was not impressed by the Bulgarians' arguments, however; he was
jabbing his finger into the air, clearly telling them to get flying again, and when
they refused, he gave two short blasts on his whistle.
"Two penalties for Ireland!" shouted Bagman, and the Bulgarian crowd howled
71with anger. "And Volkov and Vulchanov had better get back on those brooms. . .
yes. . . there they go. . . and Troy takes the Quaffle. .
Play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen. The
Beaters on both sides were acting without mercy: Volkov and Vulchanov in
particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with Bludger or
human as they swung them violently through the air. Dimitrov shot straight at
Moran, who had the Quaffle, nearly knocking her off her broom.
"Foul!" roared the Irish supporters as one, all standing up in a great wave of green.
"Foul!" echoed Ludo Bagman's magically magnified voice. "Dimitrov skins
Moran - deliberately flying to collide there - and it's got to be another penalty -
yes, there's the whistle!"
The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant
hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field. At
this, the veela lost control. Instead of dancing, they launched themselves across the
field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns.
Watching through his Omnioculars, Harry saw that they didn't look remotely
beautiful now. On the contrary, their faces were elongating into sharp, cruel-
beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders -
"And that, boys," yelled Mr. Weasley over the tumult of the crowd below, "is why
you should never go for looks alone!"
Ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the
leprechauns, but with little success; meanwhile, the pitched battle below was
nothing to the one taking place above. Harry turned this way and that, staring
through his Omnioculars, as the Quaffie changed hands with the speed of a bullet.
"Levski - Dimitrov - Moran - Troy - Mullet - Ivanova - Moran again - Moran -
MORAN SCORES!"
But the cheers of the Irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the
veela, the blasts now issuing from the Ministry members' wands, and the furious
roars of the Bulgarians. The game recommenced immediately; now Levski had the
Quaffle, now Dimitrov -
The Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing Bludger, and hit it as hard as
possible toward Krum, who did not duck quickly enough. It hit him full in the
face.
There was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum's nose looked broken, there
was blood everywhere, but Hassan Mostafa didn't blow his whistle. He had
become distracted, and Harry couldn't blame him; one of the veela had thrown a
handful of fire and set his broom tail alight.
Harry wanted someone to realize that Krum was injured; even though he was
72supporting Ireland, Krum was the most exciting player on the field. Ron obviously
felt the same.
"Time-out! Ah, come on, he can't play like that, look at him -"
"Look at Lynch!" Harry yelled.
For the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive, and Harry was quite sure that
this was no Wronski Feint; this was the real thing...
"He's seen the Snitch!" Harry shouted. "He's seen it! Look at him go!"
Half the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening; the Irish supporters
rose in another great wave of green, screaming their Seeker on. . . but Krum was
on his tail. How he could see where he was going, Harry had no idea; there were
flecks of blood flying through the air behind him, but he was drawing level with
Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again -
"They're going to crash!" shrieked Hermione.
"They're not!" roared Ron.
"Lynch is!" yelled Harry.
And he was right - for the second time, Lynch hit the ground with tremendous
force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela.
"The Snitch, where's the Snitch?" bellowed Charlie, along the row.
"He's got it - Krum's got it - it's all over!" shouted Harry.
Krum, his red robes shining with blood from his nose, was rising gently into the
air, his fist held high, a glint of gold in his hand.
The scoreboard was flashing BULGARIA: 160, IRELAND: 170 across the crowd,
who didn't seem to have realized what had happened. Then, slowly, as though a
great jumbo jet were revving up, the rumbling from the Ireland supporters grew
louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight.
"IRELAND WINS!" Bagman shouted, who like the Irish, seemed to be taken
aback by the sudden end of the match.
"KRUM GETS THE SNITCH - BUT IRELAND WINS -- good lord, I don't think
any of us were expecting that!"
"What did he catch the Snitch for?" Ron bellowed, even as he jumped up and
down, applauding with his hands over his head. "He ended it when Ireland were a
hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!"
"He knew they were never going to catch up!" Harry shouted back over all the
noise, also applauding loudly. "The Irish Chasers were too good. . . . He wanted to
73end it on his terms, that's all. . .
"He was very brave, wasn't he?" Hermione said, leaning forward to watch Krum
land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns
and veela to get to him. "He looks a terrible mess. . ."
Harry put his Omnioculars to his eyes again. It was hard to see what was
happening below, because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the
field, but he could just make out Krum, surrounded by mediwizards. He looked
surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up. His team members were
around him, shaking their heads and looking dejected; a short way away, the Irish
players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots.
Flags were waving all over the stadium, the Irish national anthem blared from all
sides; the veela were shrinking back into their usual, beautiful selves now, though
looking dispirited and forlorn.
"Vell, ve fought bravely," said a gloomy voice behind Harry. He looked around; it
was the Bulgarian Minister of Magic.
"You can speak English!" said Fudge, sounding outraged. "And you've been
letting me mime everything all day!"
"Veil, it vos very funny," said the Bulgarian minister, shrugging.
"And as the Irish team performs a lap of honor, flanked by their mascots, the
Quidditch World Cup itself is brought into the Top Box!" roared Bagman.
Harry's eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light, as the Top Box was
magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside.
Squinting toward the entrance, he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden
cup into the box, which they handed to Cornelius Fudge, who was still looking
very disgruntled that he'd been using sign language all day for nothing.
"Let's have a really loud hand for the gallant losers - Bulgaria!" Bagman shouted.
And up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated Bulgarian players. The
crowd below was applauding appreciatively; Harry could see thousands and
thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction.
One by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box, and
Bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister
and then with Fudge. Krum, who was last in line, looked a real mess. Two black
eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face. He was still holding the
Snitch. Harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground. He
was slightly duck-footed and distinctly round-shouldered. But when Krum's name
was announced, the whole stadium gave him a resounding, earsplitting roar.
And then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran and
Connolly; the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked
74strangely unfocused. But he grinned happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup
into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval. Harry's hands were numb
with clapping.
At last, when the Irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on
their brooms (Aidan Lynch on the back of Confolly's, clutching hard around his
waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way), Bagman pointed his wand at his
throat and muttered, "Quietus."
"They'll be talking about this one for years," he said hoarsely, "a really unexpected
twist, that. . . . shame it couldn't have lasted longer. . . . Ah yes... . yes, I owe you. .
. how much?"
For Fred and George had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were
standing in front of Ludo Bagman with broad grins on their faces, their hands
outstretched.
75CHAPTER NINE - THE DARK MARK
Don't tell your mother you've been gambling," Mr. Weasley implored Fred and
George as they all made their way slowly down the purple-carpeted stairs.
"Don't worry, Dad," said Fred gleefully, "we've got big plans for this money. We
don't want it confiscated."
Mr. Weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big
plans were, but seemed to decide, upon reflection, that he didn't want to know.
They were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back
to their campsites. Raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they
retraced their steps along the lantern-lit path, and leprechauns kept shooting over
their heads, cackling and waving their lanterns. When they finally reached the
tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all, and given the level of noise around them,
Mr. Weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before
turning in. They were soon arguing enjoyably about the match; Mr. Weasley got
drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with Charlie, and it was only when
Ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor
that Mr. Weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go
to bed. Hermione and Ginny went into the next tent, and Harry and the rest of the
Weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks. From the other
side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang.
"Oh I am glad I'm not on duty," muttered Mr. Weasley sleepily. "I wouldn't fancy
having to go and tell the Irish they've got to stop celebrating."
Harry, who was on a top bunk above Ron, lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of
the tent, watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead,
and picturing again some of Krum's more spectacular moves. He was itching to get
back on his own Firebolt and try out the Wronski Feint. . . . Somehow Oliver
Wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling diagrams what that
move was supposed to look like.. . . Harry saw himself in robes that had his name
on the back, and imagined the sensation of hearing a hundred-thousand-strong
crowd roar, as Ludo Bagman's voice echoed throughout the stadium, "I give you. .
. Potter!"
Harry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to sleep - his
fantasies of flying like Krum might well have slipped into actual dreams - all he
knew was that, quite suddenly, Mr. Weasley was shouting.
"Get up! Ron - Harry - come on now, get up, this is urgent!"
Harry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas.
76"S' matter?" he said.
Dimly, he could tell that something was wrong. The noises in the campsite had
changed. The singing had stopped. He could hear screams, and the sound of
people running. He slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes, but
Mr. Weasley, who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas, said, "No time,
Harry - just grab a jacket and get outside - quickly!"
Harry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent, Ron at his heels.
By the light of the few fires that were still burning, he could see people running
away into the woods, fleeing something that was moving across the field toward
them, something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire.
Loud jeering, roars of laughter, and drunken yells were drifting toward them; then
came a burst of strong green light, which illuminated the scene.
A crowd of wizards, tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing
straight upward, was marching slowly across the field. Harry squinted at them. . . .
They didn't seem to have faces. . . . Then he realized that their heads were hooded
and their faces masked. High above them, floating along in midair, four struggling
figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes. It was as though the masked
wizards on the ground were puppeteers, and the people above them were
marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air.
Two of the figures were very small.
More wizards were joining the marching group, laughing and pointing up at the
floating bodies. Tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled. Once or
twice Harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand.
Several caught fire. The screaming grew louder.
The floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent
and Harry recognized one of them: Mr. Roberts, the campsite manager. The other
three looked as though they might be his wife and children. One of the marchers
below flipped Mrs. Roberts upside down with his wand; her nightdress fell down
to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd
below her screeched and hooted with glee.
"That's sick," Ron muttered, watching the smallest Muggle child, who had begun
to spin like a top, sixty feet above the ground, his head flopping limply from side
to side. "That is really sick. . . ."
Hermione and Ginny came hurrying toward them, pulling coats over their
nightdresses, with Mr. Weasley right behind them. At the same moment, Bill,
Charlie, and Percy emerged from the boys' tent, fully dressed, with their sleeves
rolled up and their wands out.
"We're going to help the Ministry!" Mr. Weasley shouted over all the noise,
rolling up his own sleeves. "You lot - get into the woods, and stick together. I'll
come and fetch you when we've sorted this out!"
77Bill, Charlie, and Percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming
marchers; Mr. Weasley tore after them. Ministry wizards were dashing from every
direction toward the source of the trouble. The crowd beneath the Roberts family
was coming ever closer.
"C'mon," said Fred, grabbing Ginny's hand and starting to pull her toward the
wood. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and George followed. They all looked back as they
reached the trees. The crowd beneath the Roberts family was larger than ever; they
could see the Ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the
center, but they were having great difficulty. It looked as though they were scared
to perform any spell that might make the Roberts family fall.
The colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished.
Dark figures were blundering through the trees; children were crying; anxious
shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air.
Harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could
not see. Then he heard Ron yell with pain.
"What happened?" said Hermione anxiously, stopping so abruptly that Harry
walked into her. "Ron, where are you? Oh this is stupid - lumos!"
She illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path. Ron was
lying sprawled on the ground.
"Tripped over a tree root," he said angrily, getting to his feet again.
"Well, with feet that size, hard not to," said a drawling voice from behind them.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned sharply. Draco Malfoy was standing alone
nearby, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed. His arms folded, he seemed
to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees.
Ron told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he would never have dared say
in front of Mrs. Weasley.
"Language, Weasley," said Malfoy, his pale eyes glittering. "Hadn't you better be
hurrying along, now? You wouldn't like her spotted, would you?"
He nodded at Hermione, and at the same moment, a blast like a bomb sounded
from the campsite, and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around
them.
"What's that supposed to mean?" said Hermione defiantly. "Granger, they're after
Muggles, "said Malfoy. "D'you want to be showing off your knickers in midair?
Because if you do, hang around. . . they're moving this way, and it would give us
all a laugh."
"Hermione's a witch," Harry snarled.
"Have it your own way, Potter," said Malfoy, grinning maliciously. "If you think
78they can't spot a Mudblood, stay where you are."
"You watch your mouth!" shouted Ron. Everybody present knew that "Mudblood"
was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of Muggle parentage.
"Never mind, Ron," said Hermione quickly, seizing Ron's arm to restrain him as
he took a step toward Malfoy.
There came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything
they had heard. Several people nearby screamed. Malfoy chuckled softly.
"Scare easily, don't they?" he said lazily. "I suppose your daddy told you all to
hide? What's he up to - trying to rescue the Muggles?"
"Where're your parents?" said Harry, his temper rising. "Out there wearing masks,
are they?"
Malfoy turned his face to Harry, still smiling.
"Well. . . if they were, I wouldn't be likely to tell you, would I, Potter?"
"Oh come on," said Hermione, with a disgusted look at Malfoy, "let's go and find
the others."
"Keep that big bushy head down, Granger," sneered Malfoy.
"Come on," Hermione repeated, and she pulled Harry and Ron up the path again.
"I'll bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot!" said Ron hotly.
"Well, with any luck, the Ministry will catch him!" said Hermione fervently. "Oh I
can't believe this. Where have the others got to?"
Fred, George, and Ginny were nowhere to be seen, though the path was packed
with plenty of other people, all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the
commotion back at the campsite. A huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing
vociferously a little way along the path. When they saw Harry, Ron, and
Hermione, a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly, "Oü est Madame
Maxime? Nous l'avons perdue -"
"Er - what?" said Ron.
"Oh. . ." The girl who had spoken turned her back on him, and as they walked on
they distinctly heard her say, "Ogwarts."
"Beauxbatons," muttered Hermione.
"Sorry?" said Harry.
"They must go to Beauxbatons," said Hermione. "You know... Beauxbatons
Academy of Magic. . . I read about it in An Appraisal ofMagical Education in
Europe."
79"Oh. . . yeah. . . right," said Harry.
"Fred and George can't have gone that far," said Ron, pulling out his wand,
lighting it like Hermione's, and squinting up the path. Harry dug in the pockets of
his jacket for his own wand - but it wasn't there. The only thing he could find was
his Omnioculars.
"Ah, no, I don't believe it. . . I've lost my wand!"
"You're kidding!"
Ron and Hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of
light farther on the ground; Harry looked all around him, but his wand was
nowhere to be seen.
"Maybe it's back in the tent," said Ron.
"Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running?" Hermione suggested
anxiously.
"Yeah," said Harry, "maybe. .
He usually kept his wand with him at all times in the wizarding world, and finding
himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerable.
A rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump. Winky the house-elf was
fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby. She was moving in a most
peculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty; it was as though someone
invisible were trying to hold her back.
"There is bad wizards about!" she squeaked distractedly as she leaned forward and
labored to keep running. "People high - high in the air! Winky is getting out of the
way!"
And she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path, panting and
squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her.
"What's up with her?" said Ron, looking curiously after Winky. "Why can't she
run properly?"
"Bet she didn't ask permission to hide," said Harry. He was thinking of Dobby:
Every time he had tried to do something the Malfoys wouldn't like, the house-elf
had been forced to start beating himself up.
"You know, house-elves get a very raw deal!" said Hermione indignantly. "It's
slavery, that's what it is! That Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of the
stadium, and she was terrified, and he's got her bewitched so she can't even run
when they start trampling tents! Why doesn't anyone do something about it?"
"Well, the elves are happy, aren't they?" Ron said. "You heard old Winky back at
the match.. . 'House-elves is not supposed to have fun'. . . that's what she likes,
80being bossed around. . . ."
"It's people like you, Ron," Hermione began hotly, "who prop up rotten and unjust
systems, just because they're too lazy to -"
Another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood.
"Let's just keep moving, shall we?" said Ron, and Harry saw him glance edgily at
Hermione. Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps Hermione
was in more danger than they were. They set off again, Harry still searching his
pockets, even though he knew his wand wasn't there.
They followed the dark path deeper into the wood, still keeping an eye out for
Fred, George, and Ginny. They passed a group of goblins who were cackling over
a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match, and who
seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite. Farther still along the
path, they walked into a patch of silvery light, and when they looked through the
trees, they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing, surrounded by
a gaggle of young wizards, all of whom were talking very loudly.
"I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year!" one of them shouted. "I'm
a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures."
"No, you're not!" yelled his friend. "You're a dishwasher at the Leaky Cauldron. . .
. but I'm a vampire hunter, I've killed about ninety so far -"
A third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even by the dim, silvery light of
the veela, now cut in, "I'm about to become the youngest ever Minister of Magic, I
am."
Harry snorted with laughter. He recognized the pimply wizard: His name was Stan
Shunpike, and he was in fact a conductor on the triple-decker Knight Bus. He
turned to tell Ron this, but Ron's face had gone oddly slack, and next second Ron
was yelling, "Did I tell you I've invented a broomstick that'll reach Jupiter?"
"Honestly!" said Hermione, and she and Harry grabbed Ron firmly by the arms,
wheeled him around, and marched him away. By the time the sounds of the veela
and their admirers had faded completely, they were in the very heart of the wood.
They seemed to be alone now; everything was much quieter.
Harry looked around. "I reckon we can just wait here, you know. We'll hear
anyone coming a mile off."
The words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo Bagman emerged from
behind a tree right ahead of them.
Even by the feeble light of the two wands, Harry could see that a great change had
come over Bagman. He no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was no
more spring in his step. He looked very white and strained.
81"Who's that?" he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their faces.
"What are you doing in here, all alone?"
They looked at one another, surprised.
"Well - there's a sort of riot going on," said Ron.
Bagman stared at him.
"What?"
"At the campsite. . . some people have got hold of a family of Muggles. . .
Bagman swore loudly.
"Damn them!" he said, looking quite distracted, and without another word, he
Disapparated with a small pop!
"Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he?" said Hermione, frowning.
"He was a great Beater, though," said Ron, leading the way off the path into a
small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree. "The
Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them."
He took his small figure of Krum out of his pocket, set it down on the ground, and
watched it walk around. Like the real Krum, the model was slightly duck-footed
and round-shouldered, much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his
broomstick. Harry was listening for noise from the campsite. Everything seemed
much quieter; perhaps the riot was over.
"I hope the others are okay," said Hermione after a while.
"They'll be fine," said Ron.
"Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy," said Harry, sitting down next to Ron
and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves. "He's
always said he'd like to get something on him."
"That'd wipe the smirk off old Draco's face, all right," said Ron.
"Those poor Muggles, though," said Hermione nervously. "What if they can't get
them down?"
"They will," said Ron reassuringly. "They'll find a way."
"Mad, though, to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic's out
here tonight!" said Hermione. "I mean, how do they expect to get away with it? Do
you think they've been drinking, or are they just -"
But she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder. Harry and Ron looked
quickly around too. It sounded as though someone was staggering toward their
clearing. They waited, listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark
82trees. But the footsteps came to a sudden halt.
"Hello?" called Harry.
There was silence. Harry got to his feet and peered around the tree. It was too dark
to see very far, but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his
vision.
"Who's there?" he said.
And then, without warning, the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had
heard in the wood; and it uttered, not a panicked shout, but what sounded like a
spell.
"MORSMORDRE!"
And something vast, green, and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness
Harry's eyes had been struggling to penetrate; it flew up over the treetops and into
the sky.
"What the - ?" gasped Ron as he sprang to his feet again, staring up at the thing
that had appeared.
For a split second, Harry thought it was another leprechaun formation. Then he
realized that it was a colossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald stars,
with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue. As they watched, it rose
higher and higher, blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against the black
sky like a new constellation.
Suddenly, the wood all around them erupted with screams. Harry didn't understand
why, but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull, which
had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon
sign. He scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull, but he
couldn't see anyone.
"Who's there?" he called again.
"Harry, come on, move!" Hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was
tugging him backward.
"What's the matter?" Harry said, startled to see her face so white and terrified.
"It's the Dark Mark, Harry!" Hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she could.
"You-Know-Who's sign!"
"Voldemort's - "Harry, come on!"
Harry turned - Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum - the three of
them started across the clearing - but before they had taken a few hurried steps, a
series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards, appearing from
thin air, surrounding them.
83Harry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact: Each of these
wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself, Ron, and
Hermione.
Without pausing to think, he yelled, "DUCK!"
He seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground.
"STUPEFY!" roared twenty voices - there was a blinding series of flashes and
Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the
clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying
over them from the wizards' wands, crossing one another, bouncing off tree trunks,
rebounding into the darkness--
"Stop!" yelled a voice he recognized. "STOP! That's my son!"
Harry's hair stopped blowing about. He raised his head a little higher. The wizard
in front of him had lowered his wand. He rolled over and saw Mr. Weasley
striding toward them, looking terrified.
"Ron - Harry" - his voice sounded shaky - "Hermione - are you all right?"
"Out of the way, Arthur," said a cold, curt voice.
It was Mr. Crouch. He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on them.
Harry got to his feet to face them. Mr. Crouch's face was taut with rage.
"Which of you did it?" he snapped, his sharp eyes darting between them. "Which
of you conjured the Dark Mark?"
"We didn't do that!" said Harry, gesturing up at the skull.
"We didn't do anything!" said Ron, who was rubbing his elbow and looking
indignantly at his father. "What did you want to attack us for?"
"Do not lie, sir!" shouted Mr. Crouch. His wand was still pointing directly at Ron,
and his eyes were popping - he looked slightly mad. "You have been discovered at
the scene of the crime!"
"Barty," whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown, "they're kids, Barty,
they'd never have been able to
"Where did the Mark come from, you three?" said Mr. Weasley quickly.
"Over there," said Hermione shakily, pointing at the place where they had heard
the voice. "There was someone behind the trees. . . they shouted words - an
incantation -"
"Oh, stood over there, did they?" said Mr. Crouch, turning his popping eyes on
Hermione now, disbelief etched all over his face. "Said an incantation, did they?
You seem very well informed about how that Mark is summoned, missy -"
84But none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr. Crouch seemed to think it
remotely likely that Harry, Ron, or Hermione had conjured the skull; on the
contrary, at Hermione's words, they had all raised their wands again and were
pointing in the direction she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.
"We're too late," said the witch in the woolen dressing gown, shaking her head.
"They'll have Disapparated."
"I don't think so," said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard. It was Amos
Diggory, Cedric's father. "Our Stunners went right through those trees. . . . There's
a good chance we got them. . .
"Amos, be careful!" said a few of the wizards warningly as Mr. Diggory squared
his shoulders, raised his wand, marched across the clearing, and disappeared into
the darkness. Hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her mouth.
A few seconds later, they heard Mr. Diggory shout.
"Yes! We got them! There's someone here! Unconscious! It's - but - blimey. .
"You've got someone?" shouted Mr. Crouch, sounding highly disbelieving. "Who?
Who is it?"
They heard snapping twigs, the rustling of leaves, and then crunching footsteps as
Mr. Diggory reemerged from behind the trees. He was carrying a tiny, limp figure
in his arms. Harry recognized the tea towel at once. It was Winky.
Mr. Crouch did not move or speak as Mr. Diggory deposited his elf on the ground
at his feet. The other Ministry wizards were all staring at Mr. Crouch. For a few
seconds Crouch remained transfixed, his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared
down at Winky. Then he appeared to come to life again.
"This - cannot - be," he said jerkily. "No -"
He moved quickly around Mr. Diggory and strode off toward the place where he
had found Winky.
"No point, Mr. Crouch," Mr. Diggory called after him. "There's no one else there."
But Mr. Crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it. They could hear him
moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside, searching.
"Bit embarrassing," Mr. Diggory said grimly, looking down at Winky's
unconscious form. "Barty Crouch's house-elf. . . I mean to say..."
"Come off it, Amos," said Mr. Weasley quietly, "you don't seriously think it was
the elf? The Dark Mark's a wizard's sign. It requires a wand."
"Yeah," said Mr. Diggory, "and she had a wand."
"What?" said Mr. Weasley.
85"Here, look." Mr. Diggory held up a wand and showed it to Mr. Weasley. "Had it
in her hand. So that's clause three of the Code of Wand Use broken, for a start. No
non-human creature is permitted to carry or use a wand."
Just then there was another pop, and Ludo Bagman Apparated right next to Mr.
Weasley. Looking breathless and disorientated, he spun on the spot, goggling
upward at the emerald-green skull.
"The Dark Mark!" he panted, almost trampling Winky as he turned inquiringly to
his colleagues. "Who did it? Did you get them? Barry! What's going on?"
Mr. Crouch had returned empty-handed. His face was still ghostly white, and his
hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching.
"Where have you been, Barty?" said Bagman. "Why weren't you at the match?
Your elf was saving you a seat too - gulping gargoyles!" Bagman had just noticed
Winky lying at his feet. "What happened to her?"
"I have been busy, Ludo," said Mr. Crouch, still talking in the same jerky fashion,
barely moving his lips. "And my elf has been stunned."
"Stunned? By you lot, you mean? But why - ?"
Comprehension dawned suddenly on Bagman's round, shiny face; he looked up at
the skull, down at Winky, and then at Mr. Crouch.
"No!" he said. "Winky? Conjure the Dark Mark? She wouldn't know how! She'd
need a wand, for a start!"
"And she had one," said Mr. Diggory. "I found her holding one, Ludo. If it's all
right with you, Mr. Crouch, I think we should hear what she's got to say for
herself."
Crouch gave no sign that he had heard Mr. Diggory, but Mr. Diggory seemed to
take his silence for assent. He raised his own wand, pointed it at Winky, and said,
"Ennervate!"
Winky stirred feebly. Her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times
in a bemused sort of way. Watched by the silent wizards, she raised herself shakily
into a sitting position.
She caught sight of Mr. Diggory's feet, and slowly, tremulously, raised her eyes to
stare up into his face; then, more slowly still, she looked up into the sky. Harry
could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous, glassy eyes. She gave
a gasp, looked wildly around the crowded clearing, and burst into terrified sobs.
"Elf!" said Mr. Diggory sternly. "Do you know who I am? I'm a member of the
Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures!"
Winky began to rock backward and forward on the ground, her breath coming in
86sharp bursts. Harry was reminded forcibly of Dobby in his moments of terrified
disobedience.
"As you see, elf, the Dark Mark was conjured here a short while ago," said Mr.
Diggory. "And you were discovered moments later, right beneath it! An
explanation, if you please!"
"I - I - I is not doing it, sir!" Winky gasped. "I is not knowing how, sir!"
"You were found with a wand in your hand!" barked Mr. Diggory, brandishing it
in front of her. And as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing
from the skull above, Harry recognized it
"Hey - that's mine!" he said
Everyone in the clearing looked at him.
"Excuse me?" said Mr. Diggory, incredulously.
"That's my wand!" said Harry. "I dropped it!"
"You dropped it?" repeated Mr. Diggory in disbelief. "Is this a confession? You
threw it aside after you conjured the Mark?"
"Amos, think who you're talking to!" said Mr. Weasley, very angrily. "Is Harry
Potter likely to conjure the Dark Mark?"
"Er - of course not," mumbled Mr. Diggory. "Sorry. . . carried away. .
"I didn't drop it there, anyway," said Harry, jerking his thumb toward the trees
beneath the skull. "I missed it right after we got into the wood."
"So," said Mr. Diggory, his eyes hardening as he turned to look at Winky again,
cowering at his feet. "You found this wand, eh, elf? And you picked it up and
thought you'd have some fun with it, did you?"
"I is not doing magic with it, sir!" squealed Winky, tears streaming down the sides
of her squashed and bulbous nose. "I is. . . I is. . . I is just picking it up, sir! i is not
making the Dark Mark, sir, i is not knowing how!"
"It wasn't her!" said Hermione. She looked very nervous, speaking up in front of
all these Ministry wizards, yet determined all the same. "Winky's got a squeaky
little voice, and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper!" She
looked around at Harry and Ron, appealing for their support. "It didn't sound
anything like Winky, did it?"
"No," said Harry, shaking his head. "It definitely didn't sound like an elf."
"Yeah, it was a human voice," said Ron.
"Well, we'll soon see," growled Mr. Diggory, looking unimpressed. "There's a
87simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed, elf, did you know
that?"
Winky trembled and shook her head frantically, her ears flapping, as Mr. Diggory
raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with Harry's.
"Prior Incantato!" roared Mr. Diggory.
Harry heard Hermione gasp, horrified, as a gigantic serpent-tongued skull erupted
from the point where the two wands met, but it was a mere shadow of the green
skull high above them; it looked as though it were made of thick gray smoke: the
ghost of a spell.
"Deletrius!" Mr. Diggory shouted, and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of
smoke.
"So," said Mr. Diggory with a kind of savage triumph, looking down upon Winky,
who was still shaking convulsively.
"I is not doing it!" she squealed, her eyes rolling in terror. "I is not, I is not, I is not
knowing how! I is a good elf, I isn't using wands, I isn't knowing how!"
"You've been caught red-handed, elf!" Mr. Diggory roared. "Caught with the
guilty wand in your hand!"
"Amos," said Mr. Weasley loudly, "think about it. . . precious few wizards know
how to do that spell. . . . Where would she have learned it?"
"Perhaps Amos is suggesting," said Mr. Crouch, cold anger in every syllable, "that
I routinely teach my servants to conjure the Dark Mark?"
There was a deeply unpleasant silence. Amos Diggory looked horrified. "Mr.
Crouch.. . not. . . not at all.
"You have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who
are least likely to conjure that Mark!" barked Mr. Crouch. "Harry Potter - and
myself. I suppose you are familiar with the boy's story, Amos?"
"Of course - everyone knows -" muttered Mr. Diggory, looking highly
discomforted.
"And I trust you remember the many proofs I have given, over a long career, that I
despise and detest the Dark Arts and those who practice them?" Mr. Crouch
shouted, his eyes bulging again.
"Mr. Crouch, I - I never suggested you had anything to do with it!" Amos Diggory
muttered again, now reddening behind his scrubby brown beard.
"If you accuse my elf, you accuse me, Diggory!" shouted Mr. Crouch. "Where else
would she have learned to conjure it?"
88"She - she might've picked it up anywhere -"
"Precisely, Amos," said Mr. Weasley. "She might have picked it up anywhere.. . .
Winky?" he said kindly, turning to the elf, but she flinched as though he too was
shouting at her. "Where exactly did you find Harry's wand?"
Winky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it was fraying
beneath her fingers.
"I - I is finding it. . . finding it there, sir. . . ." she whispered, "there . . . in the trees,
sir.
"You see, Amos?" said Mr. Weasley. "Whoever conjured the Mark could have
Disapparated right after they'd done it, leaving Harry's wand behind. A clever
thing to do, not using their own wand, which could have betrayed them. And
Winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it
up."
"But then, she'd have been only a few feet away from the real culprit!" said Mr.
Diggory impatiently. "Elf? Did you see anyone?"
Winky began to tremble worse than ever. Her giant eyes flickered from Mr.
Diggory, to Ludo Bagman, and onto Mr. Crouch. Then she gulped and said, "I is
seeing no one, sir. . . no one. .
"Amos," said Mr. Crouch curtly, "I am fully aware that, in the ordinary course of
events, you would want to take Winky into your department for questioning. I ask
you, however, to allow me to deal with her."
Mr. Diggory looked as though he didn't think much of this suggestion at all, but it
was clear to Harry that Mr. Crouch was such an important member of the Ministry
that he did not dare refuse him.
"You may rest assured that she will be punished," Mr. Crouch added coldly.
"M-m-master. . ." Winky stammered, looking up at Mr. Crouch, her eyes
brimming with tears. "M-m-master, p-p-please. . ."
Mr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow sharpened, each line upon it more
deeply etched. There was no pity in his gaze.
"Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible," he
said slowly. "I told her to remain in the tent. I told her to stay there while I went to
sort out the trouble. And I find that she disobeyed me. This means clothes."
"No!" shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr. Crouch's feet. "No, master! Not
clothes, not clothes!"
Harry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with proper
garments. It was pitiful to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel as she
89sobbed over Mr. Crouch's feet.
"But she was frightened!" Hermione burst out angrily, glaring at Mr. Crouch.
"Your elf's scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were levitating people!
You can't blame her for wanting to get out of their way!"
Mr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf, whom
he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was
contaminating his over-shined shoes.
"I have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me," he said coldly, looking over at
Hermione. "I have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master, and
to her master's reputation."
Winky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing. There was a
very nasty silence, which was ended by Mr. Weasley, who said quietly, "Well, I
think I'll take my lot back to the tent, if nobody's got any objections. Amos, that
wand's told us all it can - if Harry could have it back, please -"
Mr. Diggory handed Harry his wand and Harry pocketed it.
"Come on, you three," Mr. Weasley said quietly. But Hermione didn't seem to
want to move; her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf. "Hermione!" Mr. Weasley
said, more urgently. She turned and followed Harry and Ron out of the clearing
and off through the trees.
"What's going to happen to Winky?" said Hermione, the moment they had left the
clearing.
"I don't know," said Mr. Weasley.
"The way they were treating her!" said Hermione furiously. "Mr. Diggory, calling
her 'elf' all the time. . . and Mr. Crouch! He knows she didn't do it and he's still
going to sack her! He didn't care how frightened she'd been, or how upset she was
- it was like she wasn't even human!"
"Well, she's not," said Ron.
Hermione rounded on him.
"That doesn't mean she hasn't got feelings, Ron. It's disgusting the way -"
"Hermione, I agree with you," said Mr. Weasley quickly, beckoning her on, "but
now is not the time to discuss elf rights. I want to get back to the tent as fast as we
can. What happened to the others?"
"We lost them in the dark," said Ron. "Dad, why was everyone so uptight about
that skull thing?"
"I'll explain everything back at the tent," said Mr. Weasley tensely.
90But when they reached the edge of the wood, their progress was impeded. A large
crowd of frightened-looking witches and wizards was congregated there, and
when they saw Mr. Weasley coming toward them, many of them surged forward.
"What's going on in there?"
"Who conjured it?"
"Arthur - it's not - Him?"
"Of course it's not Him," said Mr. Weasley impatiently. "We don't know who it
was; it looks like they Disapparated. Now excuse me, please, I want to get to bed."
He led Harry, Ron, and Hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite.
All was quiet now; there was no sign of the masked wizards, though several ruined
tents were still smoking.
Charlie's head was poking out of the boys' tent.
"Dad, what's going on?" he called through the dark. "Fred, George, and Ginny got
back okay, but the others -"
"I've got them here," said Mr. Weasley, bending down and entering the tent.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered after him.
Bill was sitting at the small kitchen table, holding a bedsheet to his arm, which
was bleeding profusely. Charlie had a large rip in his shirt, and Percy was sporting
a bloody nose. Fred, George, and Ginny looked unhurt, though shaken.
"Did you get them, Dad?" said Bill sharply. "The person who conjured the Mark?"
"No," said Mr. Weasley. "We found Barry Crouch's elf holding Harry's wand, but
we're none the wiser about who actually conured the Mark."
"What?" said Bill, Charlie, and Percy together. "Harry's wand?" said Fred.
"Mr. Crouch's elf" said Percy, sounding thunderstruck.
With some assistance from Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Mr. Weasley explained
what had happened in the woods. When they had finished their story, Percy
swelled indignantly.
"Well, Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that!" he said. "Running
away when he'd expressly told her not to. . . embarrassing him in front of the
whole Ministry. . . how would that have looked, if she'd been brought up in front
of the Department for the Regulation and Control -"
"She didn't do anything - she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time!"
Hermione snapped at Percy, who looked very taken aback. Hermione had always
got on fairly well with Percy - better, indeed, than any of the others.
91"Hermione, a wizard in Mr. Crouch's position can't afford a house-elf who's going
to run amok with a wand!" said Percy pompously, recovering himself.
"She didn't run amok!" shouted Hermione. "She just picked it up off the ground!"
"Look, can someone just explain what that skull thing was?" said Ron impatiently.
"It wasn't hurting anyone. . . . Why's it such a big deal?"
"I told you, it's You-Know-Who's symbol, Ron," said Hermione, before anyone
else could answer. "I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts."
"And it hasn't been seen for thirteen years," said Mr. Weasley quietly. "Of course
people panicked. . . it was almost like seeing You-Know-Who back again."
"I don't get it," said Ron, frowning. "I mean. . . it's still only a shape in the sky. . .
"Ron, You-Know-Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever
they killed," said Mr. Weasley. "The terror it inspired. . . you have no idea, you're
too young. Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over
your house, and knowing what you're about to find inside. . . ." Mr. Weasley
winced. "Everyone's worst fear. . . the very worst..
There was silence for a moment. Then Bill, removing the sheet from his arm to
check on his cut, said, "Well, it didn't help us tonight, whoever conjured it. It
scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it. They all Disapparated
before we'd got near enough to unmask any of them. We caught the Robertses
before they hit the ground, though. They're having their memories modified right
now."
"Death Eaters?" said Harry. "What are Death Eaters?"
"It's what You-Know-Who's supporters called themselves," said Bill. "I think we
saw what's left of them tonight - the ones who managed to keep themselves out of
Azkaban, anyway."
"We can't prove it was them, Bill," said Mr. Weasley. "Though it probably was,"
he added hopelessly.
"Yeah, I bet it was!" said Ron suddenly . "Dad, we met Draco Malfoy in the
woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks! And
we all know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who!"
"But what were Voldemort's supporters -" Harry began. Everybody flinched - like
most of the wizarding world, the Weasleys always avoided saying Voldemort's
name. "Sorry," said Harry quickly. "What were You-Know-Who's supporters up
to, levitating Muggles? I mean, what was the point?"
"The point?" said Mr. Weasley with a hollow laugh. "Harry, that's their idea of
fun. Half the Muggle killings back when You-Know-Who was in power were
done for fun. I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and couldn't resist reminding
92us all that lots of them are still at large. A nice little reunion for them," he finished
disgustedly.
"But if they were the Death Eaters, why did they Disapparate when they saw the
Dark Mark?" said Ron. "They'd have been pleased to see it, wouldn't they?"
"Use your brains, Ron," said Bill. "If they really were Death Eaters, they worked
very hard to keep out of Azkaban when You-Know-Who lost power, and told all
sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people. I bet they'd be even
more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back. They denied they'd ever
been involved with him when he lost his powers, and went back to their daily
lives. . . . I don't reckon he'd be over-pleased with them, do you?"
"So. . . whoever conjured the Dark Mark. . ." said Hermione slowly, "were they
doing it to show support for the Death Eaters, or to scare them away?"
"Your guess is as good as ours, Hermione," said Mr. Weasley. "But I'll tell you
this. . . it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it. I'd be very
surprised if the person who did it hadn't been a Death Eater once, even if they're
not now. . Listen, it's very late, and if your mother hears what's happened she'll be
worried sick. We'll get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early
Portkey out of here."
Harry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing. He knew he ought to feel
exhausted: It was nearly three in the morning, but he felt wide-awake - wide-
awake, and worried.
Three days ago - it felt like much longer, but it had only been three days - he had
awoken with his scar burning. And tonight, for the first time in thirteen years,
Lord Voldemort's mark had appeared in the sky. What did these things mean?
He thought of the letter he had written to Sirius before leaving Privet Drive.
Would Sirius have gotten it yet? When would he reply? Harry lay looking up at
the canvas, but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep, and it
was a long time after Charlie's snores filled the tent that Harry finally dozed off.
93CHAPTER TEN - MAYHEM AT THE MINISTRY
Mr. Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep. He used magic to pack up
the tents, and they left the campsite as quickly as possible, passing Mr. Roberts at
the door of his cottage. Mr. Roberts had a strange, dazed look about him, and he
waved them off with a vague "Merry Christmas."
"He'll be all right," said Mr. Weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor.
"Sometimes, when a person's memory's modified, it makes him a bit disorientated
for a while...and that was a big thing they had to make him forget."
They heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the Portkeys lay, and
when they reached it, they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered
around Basil, the keeper of the Portkeys, all clamoring to get away from the
campsite as quickly as possible. Mr. Weasley had a hurried discussion with Basil;
they joined the queue, and were able to take an old rubber tire back to Stoatshead
Hill before the sun had really risen. They walked back through Ottery St.
Catchpole and up the damp lane toward the Burrow in the dawn light, talking very
little because they were so exhausted, and thinking longingly of their breakfast. As
they rounded the corner and the Burrow came into view, a cry echoed along the
lane.
"Oh thank goodness, thank goodness!"
Mrs. Weasley, who had evidently been waiting for them in the front yard, came
running toward them, still wearing her bedroom slippers, her face pale and
strained, a rolled-up copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in her hand.
"Arthur - I've been so worried - so worried-"
She flung her arms around Mr. Weasley's neck, and the Daily Prophet fell out of
her limp hand onto the ground. Looking down, Harry saw the headline: SCENES
OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP, complete with a twinkling
black-and-white photograph of the Dark Mark over the treetops.
"You're all right," Mrs. Weasley muttered distractedly, releasing Mr. Weasley and
staring around at them all with red eyes, "you're alive. . . . Oh boys. .
And to everybody's surprise, she seized Fred and George and pulled them both
into such a tight hug that their heads banged together.
"Ouch! Mum - you're strangling us -"
"I shouted at you before you left!" Mrs. Weasley said, starting to sob. "It's all I've
been thinking about! What if You-Know-Who had got you, and the last thing I
ever said to you was that you didn't get enough OW.L.s? Oh Fred. . . George. ."
94"Come on, now, Molly, we're all perfectly okay," said Mr. Weasley soothingly,
prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the house. "Bill," he added in
an undertone, "pick up that paper, I want to see what it says. . ."
When they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen, and Hermione had made Mrs.
Weasley a cup of very strong tea, into which Mr. Weasley insisted on pouring a
shot of Ogdens Old Firewhiskey, Bill handed his father the newspaper. Mr.
Weasley scanned the front page while Percy looked over his shoulder.
"I knew it," said Mr. Weasley heavily. "Ministry blunders. . . culprits not
apprehended. . . lax security. . . Dark wizards running unchecked... national
disgrace. . . Who wrote this? Ah. . . of course. . . Rita Skeeter."
"That woman's got it in for the Ministry of Magic!" said Percy furiously. "Last
week she was saying we're wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness,
when we should be stamping out vampires! As if it wasn't specifically stated in
paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans
--"
"Do us a favor, Perce," said Bill, yawning, "and shut up."
"I'm mentioned," said Mr. Weasley, his eyes widening behind his glasses as he
reached the bottom of the Daily Prophet article.
"Where?" spluttered Mrs. Weasley, choking on her tea and whiskey. "If I'd seen
that, I'd have known you were alive!"
"Not by name," said Mr. Weasley. "Listen to this: 'If the terrified wizards and
witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected
reassurance from the Ministry ofMagic, they were sadly disappointed. A Ministry
official emerged some time after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging that
nobody had been hurt, but reflising to give any more information. Whether this
statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed
from the woods an hour later, remains to be seen.' Oh really," said Mr. Weasley in
exasperation, handing the paper to Percy. "Nobody was hurt. What was I supposed
to say? Rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods. . . well, there
certainly will be rumors now she's printed that."
He heaved a deep sigh. "Molly, I'm going to have to go into the office; this is
going to take some smoothing over."
"I'll come with you, Father," said Percy importantly. "Mr. Crouch will need all
hands on deck. And I can give him my cauldron report in person."
He bustled out of the kitchen. Mrs. Weasley looked most upset. "Arthur, you're
supposed to be on holiday! This hasn't got anything to do with your office; surely
they can handle this without you?"
"I've got to go, Molly," said Mr. Weasley. "I've made things worse. I'll just change
95into my robes and I'll be off. . . ."
"Mrs. Weasley," said Harry suddenly, unable to contain himself, "Hedwig hasn't
arrived with a letter for me, has she?"
"Hedwig, dear?" said Mrs. Weasley distractedly. "No. . . no, there hasn't been any
post at all."
Ron and Hermione looked curiously at Harry. With a meaningful look at both of
them he said, "All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room, Ron?"
"Yeah. . . think I will too," said Ron at once. "Hermione?"
"Yes," she said quickly, and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and up
the stairs.
"What's up, Harry?" said Ron, the moment they had closed the door of the attic
room behind them.
"There's something I haven't told you," Harry said. "On Saturday morning, I woke
up with my scar hurting again."
Ron's and Hermione's reactions were almost exactly as Harry had imagined them
back in his bedroom on Privet Drive. Hermione gasped and started making
suggestions at once, mentioning a number of reference books, and everybody from
Albus Dumbledore to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse. Ron simply looked
dumbstruck.
"But - he wasn't there, was he? You-Know-Who? I mean - last time your scar kept
hurting, he was at Hogwarts, wasn't he?"
"I'm sure he wasn't on Privet Drive," said Harry. "But I was dreaming about him.. .
him and Peter - you know, Wormtail. I can't remember all of it now, but they were
plotting to kill...someone."
He had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying "me," but couldn't bring
himself to make Hermione look any more horrified than she already did.
"It was only a dream," said Ron bracingly. "Just a nightmare."
"Yeah, but was it, though?" said Harry, turning to look out of the window at the
brightening sky. "It's weird, isn't it?. . . My scar hurts, and three days later the
Death Eaters are on the march, and Voldemort's sign's up in the sky again."
"Don't - say - his - name!" Ron hissed through gritted teeth.
"And remember what Professor Trelawney said?" Harry went on, ignoring Ron.
"At the end of last year?"
Professor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at Hogwarts. Hermione's
terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort.
96"Oh Harry, you aren't going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says?"
"You weren't there," said Harry. "You didn't hear her. This time was different. I
told you, she went into a trance - a real one. And she said the Dark Lord would
rise again. . . greater and more terrible than ever before. . . and he'd manage it
because his servant was going to go back to him. . . and that night Wormtail
escaped."
There was a silence in which Ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in his
Chudley Cannons bedspread.
"Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry?" Hermione asked. "Are you
expecting a letter?"
"I told Sirius about my scar," said Harry, shrugging. "I'm waiting for his answer."
"Good thinking!" said Ron, his expression clearing. "I bet Sirius'll know what to
do!"
"I hoped he'd get back to me quickly," said Harry.
"But we don't know where Sirius is. . . he could be in Africa or somewhere,
couldn't he?" said Hermione reasonably. "Hedwig's not going to manage that
journey in a few days."
"Yeah, I know," said Harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he
looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky.
"Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry" said Ron. "Come on -
three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play. .. . You can try out
the Wronski Feint... ."
"Ron," said Hermione, in an I-don't-think-you're-being-very-sensitive sort of
voice, "Harry doesn't want to play Quidditch right now... . He's worried, and he's
tired. . . . We all need to go to bed..."
"Yeah, I want to play Quidditch," said Harry suddenly. "Hang on, I'll get my
Firebolt."
Hermione left the room, muttering something that sounded very much like "Boys."
Neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following week. Both
left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up, and returned well
after dinner every night.
"It's been an absolute uproar," Percy told them importantly the Sunday evening
before they were due to return to Hogwarts. "I've been putting out fires all week.
People keep sending Howlers, and of course, if you don't open a Howler straight
away, it explodes. Scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to
cinders."
97"Why are they all sending Howlers?" asked Ginny, who was mending her copy of
One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi with Spellotape on the rug in front of the
living room fire.
"Complaining about security at the World Cup," said Percy. "They want
compensation for their ruined property. Mundungus Fletcher's put in a claim for a
twelve-bedroomed tent with en-suite Jacuzzi, but I've got his number. I know for a
fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks."
Mrs. Weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner. Harry liked this
clock. It was completely useless if you wanted to know the time, but otherwise
very informative. It had nine golden hands, and each of them was engraved with
one of the Weasley family's names. There were no numerals around the face, but
descriptions of where each family member might be. "Home," "school," and
"work" were there, but there was also "traveling," "lost," "hospital," "prison," and,
in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock, "mortal
peril."
Eight of the hands were currently pointing to the "home" position, but Mr.
Weasley's, which was the longest, was still pointing to "work." Mrs. Weasley
sighed.
"Your father hasn't had to go into the office on weekends since the days of You-
Know-Who," she said. "They're working him far too hard. His dinner's going to be
ruined if he doesn't come home soon."
"Well, Father feels he's got to make up for his mistake at the match, doesn't he?"
said Percy. "If truth be told, he was a tad unwise to make a public statement
without clearing it with his Head of Department first -"
"Don't you dare blame your father for what that wretched Skeeter woman wrote!"
said Mrs. Weasley, flaring up at once.
"If Dad hadn't said anything, old Rita would just have said it was disgraceful that
nobody from the Ministry had commented," said Bill, who was playing chess with
Ron. "Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look good. Remember, she interviewed all
the Gringotts' Charm Breakers once, and called me 'a long-haired pillock'?"
"Well, it is a bit long, dear," said Mrs. Weasley gently. "If you'd just let me -"
"No, Mum."
Rain lashed against the living room window. Hermione was immersed in The
Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, copies of which Mrs. Weasley had bought for
her, Harry, and Ron in Diagon Alley. Charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava.
Harry was polishing his Firebolt, the broomstick servicing kit Hermione had given
him for his thirteenth birthday open at his feet. Fred and George were sitting in a
far corner, quills out, talking in whispers, their heads bent over a piece of
parchment.
98"What are you two up to?" said Mrs. Weasley sharply, her eyes on the twins.
"Homework," said Fred vaguely.
"Don't be ridiculous, you're still on holiday," said Mrs. Weasley.
"Yeah, we've left it a bit late," said George.
"You're not by any chance writing out a new order form, are you?" said Mrs.
Weasley shrewdly. "You wouldn't be thinking of restarting Weasleys' Wizard
Wheezes, by any chance?"
"Now, Mum," said Fred, looking up at her, a pained look on his face. "If the
Hogwarts Express crashed tomorrow, and George and I died, how would you feel
to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an unfounded accusation?"
Everyone laughed, even Mrs. Weasley.
"Oh your father's coming!" she said suddenly, looking up at the clock again.
Mr. Weasley's hand had suddenly spun from "work" to "traveling"; a second later
it had shuddered to a halt on "home" with the others, and they heard him calling
from the kitchen.
"Coming, Arthur!" called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying out of the room.
A few moments later, Mr. Weasley came into the warm living room carrying his
dinner on a tray. He looked completely exhausted.
"Well, the fat's really in the fire now," he told Mrs. Weasley as he sat down in an
armchair near the hearth and toyed unenthusiastically with his somewhat shriveled
cauliflower. "Rita Skeeter's been ferreting around all week, looking for more
Ministry mess-ups to report. And now she's found out about poor old Bertha going
missing, so that'll be the headline in the Prophet tomorrow. I told Bagman he
should have sent someone to look for her ages ago."
"Mr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks," said Percy swiftly.
"Crouch is very lucky Rita hasn't found out about Winky," said Mr. Weasley
irritably. "There'd be a week's worth of headlines in his house-elf being caught
holding the wand that conjured the Dark Mark."
"I thought we were all agreed that that elf, while irresponsible, did not conjure the
Mark?" said Percy hotly.
"If you ask me, Mr. Crouch is very lucky no one at the Daily Prophet knows how
mean he is to elves!" said Hermione angrily.
"Now look here, Hermione!" said Percy. "A high-ranking Ministry official like
Mr. Crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants -"
99"His slave, you mean!" said Hermione, her voice rising passionately, "because he
didn't pay Winky, did he?"
"I think you'd all better go upstairs and check that you've packed properly!" said
Mrs. Weasley, breaking up the argument. "Come on now, all of you. . . ."
Harry repacked his broomstick servicing kit, put his Firebolt over his shoulder,
and went back upstairs with Ron. The rain sounded even louder at the top of the
house, accompanied by loud whistlings and moans from the wind, not to mention
sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic. Pigwidgeon began twittering
and zooming around his cage when they entered. The sight of the half-packed
trunks seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitement.
"Bung him some Owl Treats," said Ron, throwing a packet across to Harry. "It
might shut him up."
Harry poked a few Owl Treats through the bars of Pigwidgeon's cage, then turned
to his trunk. Hedwig's cage stood next to it, still empty.
"It's been over a week," Harry said, looking at Hedwig's deserted perch. "Ron, you
don't reckon Sirius has been caught, do you?"
"Nah, it would've been in the Daily Prophet," said Ron. "The Ministry would want
to show they'd caught someone, wouldn't they?"
"Yeah, I suppose. . . ."
"Look, here's the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley. And she's got some gold
out of your vault for you. . . and she's washed all your socks."
He heaved a pile of parcels onto Harry's camp bed and dropped the money bag and
a load of socks next to it. Harry started unwrapping the shopping. Apart from The
Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by Miranda Goshawk, he had a handful of new
quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potion-making kit - he had
been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna. He was just
piling underwear into his cauldron when Ron made a loud noise of disgust behind
him.
"What is that supposed to be?"
He was holding up something that looked to Harry like a long, maroon velvet
dress. It had a moldy-looking lace frill at the collar and matching lace cuffs.
There was a knock on the door, and Mrs. Weasley entered, carrying an armful of
freshly laundered Hogwarts robes.
"Here you are," she said, sorting them into two piles. "Now, mind you pack them
properly so they don't crease."
"Mum, you've given me Ginny's new dress," said Ron, handing it out to her.
100"Of course I haven't," said Mrs. Weasley. "That's for you. Dress robes."
"What?" said Ron, looking horror-struck.
"Dress robes!" repeated Mrs. Weasley. "It says on your school list that you're
supposed to have dress robes this year. . . robes for formal occasions."
"You've got to be kidding," said Ron in disbelief. "I'm not wearing that, no way."
"Everyone wears them, Ron!" said Mrs. Weasley crossly. "They're all like that!
Your father's got some for smart parties!"
"I'll go starkers before I put that on," said Ron stubbornly.
"Don't be so silly," said Mrs. Weasley. "You've got to have dress robes, they're on
your list! I got some for Harry too. . . show him, Harry... ."
In some trepidation, Harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed. It wasn't as bad
as he had expected, however; his dress robes didn't have any lace on them at all -
in fact, they were more or less the same as his school ones, except that they were
bottle green instead of black.
"I thought they'd bring out the color of your eyes, dear," said Mrs. Weasley fondly.
"Well, they're okay!" said Ron angrily, looking at Harry's robes. "Why couldn't I
have some like that?"
"Because. . . well, I had to get yours secondhand, and there wasn't a lot of choice!"
said Mrs. Weasley, flushing.
Harry looked away. He would willingly have split all the money in his Gringotts
vault with the Weasleys, but he knew they would never take it.
"I'm never wearing them," Ron was saying stubbornly. "Never."
"Fine," snapped Mrs. Weasley. "Go naked. And, Harry, make sure you get a
picture of him. Goodness knows I could do with a laugh."
She left the room, slamming the door behind her. There was a funny spluttering
noise from behind them. Pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge Owl Treat.
"Why is everything I own rubbish?" said Ron furiously, striding across the room
to unstick Pigwidgeon's beak.
101CHAPTER ELEVEN - ABOARD THE HOGWART EXPRESS
There was a definite end-of-the-holidays gloom in the air when Harry awoke next
morning. Heavy rain was still splattering against the window as he got dressed in
jeans and a sweatshirt; they would change into their school robes on the Hogwarts
Express.
He, Ron, Fred, and George had just reached the first-floor landing on their way
down to breakfast, when Mrs. Weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs, looking
harassed.
"Arthur!" she called up the staircase. "Arthur! Urgent message from the Ministry!"
Harry flattened himself against the wall as Mr. Weasley came clattering past with
his robes on back-to-front and hurtled out of sight. When Harry and the others
entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers -
"I've got a quill here somewhere!" - and Mr. Weasley bending over the fire,
talking to -
Harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were
working properly.
Amos Diggory's head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large, bearded
egg. It was talking very fast, completely unperturbed by the sparks flying around it
and the flames licking its ears.
". . . Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so they went and called those
what-d'you-call-'ems - please-men. Arthur, you've got to get over there --"
"Here!" said Mrs. Weasley breathlessly, pushing a piece of parchment, a bottle of
ink, and a crumpled quill into Mr. Weasley's hands.
"- it's a real stroke of luck I heard about it," said Mr. Diggory's head. "I had to
come into the office early to send a couple of owls, and I found the Improper Use
of Magic lot all setting off -- if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one, Arthur --"
"What does Mad-Eye say happened?" asked Mr. Weasley, unscrewing the ink
bottle, loading up his quill, and preparing to take notes.
Mr. Diggory's head rolled its eyes. "Says he heard an intruder in his yard. Says he
was creeping toward the house, but was ambushed by his dustbins."
"What did the dustbins do?" asked Mr. Weasley, scribbling frantically.
"Made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere, as far as I can tell," said
Mr. Diggory. "Apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the please-
men turned up -"
Mr. Weasley groaned.
102"And what about the intruder?"
"Arthur, you know Mad-Eye," said Mr. Diggory's head, rolling its eyes again.
"Someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night? More likely there's a very
shell-shocked cat wandering around somewhere, covered in potato peelings. But if
the Improper Use of Magic lot get their hands on Mad-Eye, he's had it -- think of
his record -- we've got to get him off on a minor charge, something in your
department -- what are exploding dustbins worth?"
"Might be a caution," said Mr. Weasley, still writing very fast, his brow furrowed.
"Mad-Eye didn't use his wand? He didn't actually attack anyone?"
"I'll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through
the window," said Mr. Diggory, "but they'll have a job proving it, there aren't any
casualties."
"All right, I'm off," Mr. Weasley said, and he stuffed the parchment with his notes
on it into his pocket and dashed out of the kitchen again.
Mr. Diggory's head looked around at Mrs. Weasley.
"Sorry about this, Molly," it said, more calmly, "bothering you so early and
everything...but Arthur's the only one who can get Mad-Eye off, and Mad-Eye's
supposed to be starting his new job today. Why he had to choose last night. ."
"Never mind, Amos," said Mrs. Weasley. "Sure you won't have a bit of toast or
anything before you go?"
"Oh go on, then," said Mr. Diggory.
Mrs. Weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a stack on the kitchen table, put
it into the fire tongs, and transferred it into Mr. Diggory's mouth.
"Fanks," he said in a muffled voice, and then, with a small pop, vanished.
Harry could hear Mr. Weasley calling hurried good-byes to Bill, Charlie, Percy,
and the girls. Within five minutes, he was back in the kitchen, his robes on the
right way now, dragging a comb through his hair.
"I'd better hurry - you have a good term, boys, said Mr. Weasley to Harry, Ron,
and the twins, fastening a cloak over his shoulders and preparing to Disapparate.
"Molly, are you going to be all right taking the kids to King's Cross?"
"Of course I will," she said. "You just look after Mad-Eye, we'll be fine."
As Mr. Weasley vanished, Bill and Charlie entered the kitchen.
"Did someone say Mad-Eye?" Bill asked. "What's he been up to now."
"He says someone tried to break into his house last night," said Mrs. Weasley.
103"Mad-Eye Moody?" said George thoughtfully, spreading marmalade on his toast.
"Isn't he that nutter -"
"Your father thinks very highly of Mad-Eye Moody," said Mrs. Weasley sternly.
"Yeah, well, Dad collects plugs, doesn't he?" said Fred quietly as Mrs. Weasley
left the room. "Birds of a feather. . ."
"Moody was a great wizard in his time," said Bill.
"He's an old friend of Dumbledore's, isn't he?" said Charlie.
"Dumbledore's not what you'd call normal, though, is he?" said Fred. "I mean, I
know he's a genius and everything.. ."
"Who is Mad-Eye?" asked Harry.
"He's retired, used to work at the Ministry," said Charlie. "I met him once when
Dad took me into work with him. He was an Auror - one of the best. . . a Dark
wizard catcher," he added, seeing Harry's blank look "Half the cells in Azkaban
are full because of him. He made himself loads of enemies, though. . . the families
of people he caught, mainly. . . and I heard he's been getting really paranoid in his
old age. Doesn't trust anyone anymore. Sees Dark wizards everywhere."
Bill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off at King's Cross station, but
Percy, apologizing most profusely, said that he really needed to get to work.
"I just can't justify taking more time off at the moment," he told them. "Mr.
Crouch is really starting to rely on me."
"Yeah, you know what, Percy?" said George seriously. "I reckon he'll know your
name soon."
Mrs. Weasley had braved the telephone in the village post office to order three
ordinary Muggle taxis to take them into London.
"Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us," Mrs. Weasley whispered to Harry as
they stood in the rain-washed yard, watching the taxi drivers heaving six heavy
Hogwarts trunks into their cars. "But there weren't any to spare. . . . Oh dear, they
don't look happy, do they?"
Harry didn't like to tell Mrs. Weasley that Muggle taxi drivers rarely transported
overexcited owls, and Pigwidgeon was making an earsplitting racket. Nor did it
help that a number of Filibuster's Fabulous No-Heat, Wet-Start Fireworks went off
unexpectedly when Fred's trunk sprang open, causing the driver carrying it to yell
with fright and pain as Crookshanks clawed his way up the man's leg.
The journey was uncomfortable, owing to the fact that they were jammed in the
back of the taxis with their trunks. Crookshanks took quite a while to recover from
the fireworks, and by the time they entered London, Harry, Ron, and Hermione
104were all severely scratched. They were very relieved to get out at King's Cross,
even though the rain was coming down harder than ever, and they got soaked
carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station.
Harry was used to getting onto platform nine and three-quarters by now. It was a
simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier dividing
platforms nine and ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an unobtrusive way,
so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in groups today; Harry,
Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they were accompanied by
Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned casually against the barrier,
chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways through it. . . and as they did so,
platform nine and three-quarters materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there, clouds
of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students and
parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became noisier
than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist. Harry, Ron,
and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their luggage in a
compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back down onto the
platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.
"I might be seeing you all sooner than you think," said Charlie, grinning, as he
hugged Ginny good-bye.
"Why?" said Fred keenly.
"You'll see," said Charlie. "Just don't tell Percy I mentioned it.. . it's 'classified
information, until such time as the Ministry sees fit to release it,' after all."
"Yeah, I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year," said Bill, hands in his
pockets, looking almost wistfully at the train.
"Why?" said George impatiently.
"You're going to have an interesting year," said Bill, his eyes twinkling. "I might
even get time off to come and watch a bit of it."
"A bit of what?" said Ron.
But at that moment, the whistle blew, and Mrs. Weasley chivvied them toward the
train doors.
"Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley," said Hermione as they climbed on
board, closed the door, and leaned out of the window to talk to her.
"Yeah, thanks for everything, Mrs. Weasley," said Harry.
"Oh it was my pleasure, dears," said Mrs. Weasley. "I'd invite you for Christmas,
but...well, I expect you're all going to want to stay at Hogwarts, what with. . . one
thing and another."
105"Mum!" said Ron irritably. "What d'you three know that we don't?"
"You'll find out this evening, I expect," said Mrs. Weasley, smiling. "It's going to
be very exciting - mind you, I'm very glad they've changed the rules -"
"What rules?" said Harry, Ron, Fred, and George together.
"I'm sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you. . . . Now, behave, won't you? Won't
you, Fred? And you, George?"
The pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move.
"Tell us what's happening at Hogwarts!" Fred bellowed out of the window as Mrs.
Weasley, Bill, and Charlie sped away from them. "What rules are they changing?"
But Mrs. Weasley only smiled and waved. Before the train had rounded the
corner, she, Bill, and Charlie had Disapparated.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione went back to their compartment. The thick rain
splattering the windows made it very difficult to see out of them. Ron undid his
trunk, pulled out his maroon dress robes, and flung them over Pigwidgeon's cage
to muffle his hooting.
"Bagman wanted to tell us what's happening at Hogwarts," he said grumpily,
sitting down next to Harry. "At the World Cup, remember? But my own mother
won't say. Wonder what --"
"Shh!" Hermione whispered suddenly, pressing her finger to her lips and pointing
toward the compartment next to theirs. Harry and Ron listened, and heard a
familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door.
". . . Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than Hogwarts,
you know. He knows the headmaster, you see. Well, you know his opinion of
Dumbledore - the man's such a Mudblood-lover - and Durmstrang doesn't admit
that sort of riffraff. But Mother didn't like the idea of me going to school so far
away. Father says Durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than Hogwarts about
the Dark Arts. Durmstrang students actually learn them, not just the defense
rubbish we do. . . ."
Hermione got up, tiptoed to the compartment door, and slid it shut, blocking out
Malfoy's voice.
"So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him, does he?" she said angrily. "I
wish he had gone, then we wouldn't have to put up with him."
"Durmstrang's another wizarding school?" said Harry.
"Yes," said Hermione sniffily, "and it's got a horrible reputation. According to An
Appraisal ofMagical Education in Europe, it puts a lot of emphasis on the Dark
Arts."
106"I think I've heard of it," said Ron vaguely. "Where is it? What country?"
"Well, nobody knows, do they?" said Hermione, raising her eyebrows.
"Er - why not?" said Harry.
"There's traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools.
Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can
steal their secrets," said Hermione matter-of-factly.
"Come off it," said Ron, starting to laugh. "Durmstrang's got to be about the same
size as Hogwarts -- how are you going to hide a great big castle?"
"But Hogwarts is hidden," said Hermione, in surprise. "Everyone knows that.. .
well, everyone who's read Hogwarts, A History, anyway."
"Just you, then," said Ron. "So go on - how d'you hide a place like Hogwarts?"
"It's bewitched," said Hermione. "If a Muggle looks at it, all they see is a
moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying DANGER, DO NOT
ENTER, UNSAFE."
"So Durmstrang'll just look like a ruin to an outsider too?"
"Maybe," said Hermione, shrugging, "or it might have Muggle-repelling charms
on it, like the World Cup stadium. And to keep foreign wizards from finding it,
they'll have made it Unplottable -"
"Come again?"
"Well, you can enchant a building so it's impossible to plot on a map, can't you?"
"Er. . . if you say so," said Harry.
"But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north," said Hermione
thoughtfully. "Somewhere very cold, because they've got fur capes as part of their
uniforms."
"Ah, think of the possibilities," said Ron dreamily. "It would've been so easy to
push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident... . Shame his mother
likes him. . . ."
The rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved farther north. The sky was
so dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by midday. The lunch
trolley came rattling along the corridor, and Harry bought a large stack of
Cauldron Cakes for them to share.
Several of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed, including
Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom, a round-faced,
extremely forgetful boy who had been brought up by his formidable witch of a
grandmother. Seamus was still wearing his Ireland rosette. Some of its magic
107seemed to be wearing off now; it was still squeaking "Troy - Mullet - Moran!" but
in a very feeble and exhausted sort of way. After half an hour or so, Hermione,
growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk, buried herself once more in The
Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying to learn a Summoning
Charm.
Neville listened jealously to the others' conversation as they relived the Cup
match.
"Gran didn't want to go," he said miserably. "Wouldn't buy tickets. It sounded
amazing though."
"It was," said Ron. "Look at this, Neville. . .
He rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the miniature
figure of Viktor Krum.
"Oh wow," said Neville enviously as Ron tipped Krum onto his pudgy hand.
"We saw him right up close, as well," said Ron. "We were in the Top Box -"
"For the first and last time in your life, Weasley."
Draco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway. Behind him stood Crabbe and Goyle,
his enormous, thuggish cronies, both of whom appeared to have grown at least a
foot during the summer. Evidently they had overheard the conversation through
the compartment door, which Dean and Seamus had left ajar.
"Don't remember asking you to join us, Malfoy," said Harry coolly.
"Weasley. . . what is that?" said Malfoy, pointing at Pigwidgeon's cage. A sleeve
of Ron's dress robes was dangling from it, swaying with the motion of the train,
the moldy lace cuff very obvious.
Ron made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Malfoy was too quick for him; he
seized the sleeve and pulled.
"Look at this!" said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up Ron's robes and showing
Crabbe and Goyle, "Weasley, you weren't thinking of wearing these, were you? I
mean - they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety. . .
"Eat dung, Malfoy!" said Ron, the same color as the dress robes as he snatched
them back out of Malfoy's grip. Malfoy howled with derisive laughter; Crabbe and
Goyle guffawed stupidly.
"So. . . going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family
name? There's money involved as well, you know. . . you'd be able to afford some
decent robes if you won. . . ."
"What are you talking about?" snapped Ron.
108'Are you going to enter?' Malfoy repeated. "I suppose you will, Potter? You never
miss a chance to show off, do you?"
"Either explain what you're on about or go away, Malfoy," said Hermione testily,
over the top of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4.
A gleeful smile spread across Malfoy's pale face
"Don't tell me you don't know?" he said delightedly. "You've got a father and
brother at the Ministry and you don't even know? My God, my father told me
about it ages ago. . . heard it from Cornelius Fudge. But then, Father's always
associated with the top people at the Ministry. . . . Maybe your father's too junior
to know about it, Weasley. . . yes. . . they probably don't talk about important stuff
in front of him. . . ."
Laughing once more, Malfoy beckoned to Crabbe and Goyle, and the three of
them disappeared.
Ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard behind
them that the glass shattered.
"Ron!" said Hermione reproachfully, and she pulled out her wand, muttered
"Reparo!" and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door.
"Well.. . making it look like he knows everything and we don't.. . ." Ron snarled.
"Father's always associated with the top peopie at the Ministry.'. . . Dad could've
got a promotion any time... he just likes it where he is. . . ."
"Of course he does," said Hermione quietly. "Don't let Malfoy get to you, Ron -"
"Him! Get to me!? As if!" said Ron, picking up one of the remaining Cauldron
Cakes and squashing it into a pulp.
Ron's bad mood continued for the rest of the journey. He didn't talk much as they
changed into their school robes, and was still glowering when the Hogwarts
Express slowed down at last and finally stopped in the pitch-darkness of
Hogsmeade station.
As the train doors opened, there was a rumble of thunder overhead. Hermione
bundled up Crookshanks in her cloak and Ron left his dress robes over
Pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads bent and eyes narrowed against the
downpour. The rain was now coming down so thick and fast that it was as though
buckets of ice-cold water were being emptied repeatedly over their heads.
"Hi, Hagrid!" Harry yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the
platform.
"All righ', Harry?" Hagrid bellowed back, waving. "See yeh at the feast if we don'
drown!"
109First years traditionally reached Hogwarts Castle by sailing across the lake with
Hagrid.
"Oooh, I wouldn't fancy crossing the lake in this weather," said Hermione
fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest of
the crowd. A hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them outside the
station. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville climbed gratefully into one of them,
the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great lurch, the long
procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track toward
Hogwarts Castle.
110CHAPTER TWELVE - THE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT
Through the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the sweeping
drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what was fast becoming a
gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see Hogwarts coming nearer, its
many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain.
Lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great
oak front doors, which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps. People who had
occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the
castle. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville jumped down from their carriage and
dashed up the steps too, looking up only when they were safely inside the
cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble staircase.
"Blimey," said Ron, shaking his head and sending water everywhere, "if that keeps
up the lake's going to overflow. I'm soak - ARRGH!"
A large, red, water-filled balloon had dropped from out of the ceiling onto Ron's
head and exploded. Drenched and sputtering, Ron staggered sideways into Harry,
just as a second water bomb dropped - narrowly missing Hermione, it burst at
Harry's feet, sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into his socks. People
all around them shrieked and started pushing one another in their efforts to get out
of the line of fire. Harry looked up and saw, floating twenty feet above them,
Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a bell-covered hat and orange bow tie, his
wide, malicious face contorted with concentration as he took aim again.
"PEEVES!" yelled an angry voice. "Peeves, come down here at ONCE!"
Professor McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress and head of Gryffindor House, had
come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed
Hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling.
"Ouch - sorry, Miss Granger -"
"That's all right, Professor!" Hermione gasped, massaging her throat.
"Peeves, get down here NOW!" barked Professor McGonagall, straightening her
pointed hat and glaring upward through her square-rimmed spectacles.
"Not doing nothing!" cackled Peeves, lobbing a water bomb at several fifth-year
girls, who screamed and dived into the Great Hall. "Already wet, aren't they?
Little squirts! Wheeeeeeeeee!" And he aimed another bomb at a group of second
years who had just arrived.
"I shall call the headmaster!" shouted Professor McGonagall. "I'm warning you,
Peeves -"
Peeves stuck out his tongue, threw the last of his water bombs into the air, and
zoomed off up the marble staircase, cackling insanely.
111"Well, move along, then!" said Professor McGonagall sharply to the bedraggled
crowd. "Into the Great Hall, come on!"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione slipped and slid across the entrance hall and through
the double doors on the right, Ron muttering furiously under his breath as he
pushed his sopping hair off his face.
The Great Hall looked its usual splendid self, decorated for the start-of-term feast.
Golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and hundreds of
candles, floating over the tables in midair. The four long House tables were
packed with chattering students; at the top of the Hall, the staff sat along one side
of a fifth table, facing their pupils. It was much warmer in here. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione walked past the Slytherins, the Ravenclaws, and the Hufflepuffs, and sat
down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the Hall, next to Nearly
Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost. Pearly white and semitransparent, Nick was
dressed tonight in his usual doublet, but with a particularly large ruff, which
served the dual purpose of looking extra-festive, and insuring that his head didn't
wobble too much on his partially severed neck.
"Good evening," he said, beaming at them.
"Says who?" said Harry, taking off his sneakers and emptying them of water.
"Hope they hurry up with the Sorting. I'm starving."
The Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the start of every school
year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn't been present
at one since his own. He was quite looking forward to it. Just then, a highly
excited, breathless voice called down the table.
"Hiya, Harry!"
It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero.
"Hi, Colin," said Harry warily.
"Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother's starting! My brother
Dennis!"
"Er - good," said Harry.
"He's really excited!" said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat. "I
just hope he's in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?"
"Er - yeah, all right," said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and Nearly
Headless Nick. "Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don't they?"
he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into
Gryffindor.
"Oh no, not necessarily," said Hermione. "Parvati Patil's twin's in Ravenclaw, and
they're identical. You'd think they'd be together, wouldn't you?"
112Harry looked up at the staff table. There seemed to be rather more empty seats
there than usual. Hagrid, of course, was still fighting his way across the lake with
the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervising the drying of
the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too, and Harry couldn't
think who else was missing.
"Where's the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?" said Hermione, who
was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had lasted
more than three terms. Harry's favorite by far had been Professor Lupin, who had
resigned last year. He looked up and down the staff table. There was definitely no
new face there.
"Maybe they couldn't get anyone!" said Hermione, looking anxious.
Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms
teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside Professor Sprout, the
Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray hair. She was
talking to Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department. On Professor Sinistra's
other side was the sallow-faced, hook-nosed, greasy-haired Potions master, Snape
- Harry's least favorite person at Hogwarts. Harry's loathing of Snape was matched
only by Snape's hatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible, intensified last year,
when Harry had helped Sirius escape right under Snape's overlarge nose - Snape
and Sirius had been enemies since their own school days.
On Snape's other side was an empty seat, which Harry guessed was Professor
McGonagall's. Next to it, and in the very center of the table, sat Professor
Dumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the
candlelight, his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with many stars and
moons. The tips of Dumbledore's long, thin fingers were together and he was
resting his chin upon them, staring up at the ceiling through his half-moon
spectacles as though lost in thought. Harry glanced up at the ceiling too. It was
enchanted to look like the sky outside, and he had never seen it look this stormy.
Black and purple clouds were swirling across it, and as another thunderclap
sounded outside, a fork of lightning flashed across it.
"Oh hurry up," Ron moaned, beside Harry, "I could eat a hippogriff."
The words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the Great Hall
opened and silence fell. Professor McGonagall was leading a long line of first
years up to the top of the Hall. If Harry, Ron, and Hermione were wet, it was
nothing to how these first years looked. They appeared to have swum across the
lake rather than sailed. All of them were shivering with a combination of cold and
nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest
of the school - all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair,
who was wrapped in what Harry recognized as Hagrid's moleskin overcoat. The
coat was so big for him that it hooked as though he were draped in a furry black
113circus tent. His small face protruded from over the collar, looking almost painfully
excited. When he had lined up with his terrified-looking peers, he caught Colin
Creevey's eye, gave a double thumbs-up, and mouthed, I fell in the lake! He
looked positively delighted about it.
Professor McGonagall now placed a three-legged stool on the ground before the
first years and, on top of it, an extremely old, dirty patched wizard's hat. The first
years stared at it. So did everyone else. For a moment, there was silence. Then a
long tear near the brim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat broke into song:
A thousand years or more ago,
When I was newly sewn,
There lived four wizards of renown,
Whose names are still well known:
Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor,
Fair Ravenclaw, from glen,
Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,
Shrewd Slytherin, from fin.
They shared a wish, a hope, a dream,
They hatched a daring plan
To educate young sorcerers
Thus Hogwarts School began.
Now each of these four founders
Formed their own house, for each
Did value different virtues
In the ones they had to teach.
By Gryffindor, the bravest were
Prized far beyond the rest;
For Ravenclaw, the cleverest
Would always be the best;
For Hufflepuff, hard workers were
Most worthy of admission;
114And power-hungry Slytherin
Loved those of great ambition.
While still alive they did divide
Their favorites from the throng,
Yet how to pick the worthy ones
When they were dead and gone?
'Twas Gryffindor who found the way,
He whipped me off his head
The founders put some brains in me
So I could choose instead!
Now slip me snug about your ears,
I've never yet been wrong,
I'll have a look inside your mind
And tell where you belong!
The Great Hall rang with applause as the Sorting Hat finished.
"That's not the song it sang when it Sorted us," said Harry, clapping along with
everyone else.
"Sings a different one every year," said Ron. "It's got to be a pretty boring life,
hasn't it, being a hat? I suppose it spends all year making up the next one."
Professor McGonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of parchment.
"When I call out your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool," she told
the first years. "When the hat announces your House, you will go and sit at the
appropriate table.
"Ackerley, Stewart!"
A boy walked forward, visibly trembling from head to foot, picked up the Sorting
Hat, put it on, and sat down on the stool.
"RAVENCLAW!" shouted the hat.
Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw table,
where everyone was applauding him. Harry caught a glimpse of Cho, the
Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he sat down. For a fleeting
second, Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too.
115"Baddock, Malcolm!"
"SLYTHERIN!"
The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; Harry could see Malfoy
clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins. Harry wondered whether Baddock
knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than
any other. Fred and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat down.
"Branstone, Eleanor!"
"HUFFLEPUFF!"
"Cauldwell, Owen!"
"HUFFLEPUFF!"
"Creevey, Dennis!"
Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over Hagrid's moleskin, just as
Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers' table.
About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, Hagrid, with
his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming - a
misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a
very kind nature. He winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table
and watched Dennis Creevey putting on the Sorting Hat. The rip at the brim
opened wide-- -
"GRYFFINDOR!" the hat shouted.
Hagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey, beaming widely,
took off the hat, placed it back on the stool, and hurried over to join his brother.
"Colin, I fell in!" he said shrilly, throwing himself into an empty seat. "It was
brilliant! And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the
boat!"
"Cool!" said Colin, just as excitedly. "It was probably the giant squid, Dennis!"
"Wow!" said Dennis, as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for
more than being thrown into a storm-tossed, fathoms-deep lake, and pushed out of
it again by a giant sea monster.
"Dennis! Dennis! See that boy down there? The one with the black hair and
glasses? See him? Know who he is, Dennis?"
Harry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting Hat, now Sorting Emma
Dobbs.
The Sorting continued; boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their faces
moving one by one to the three-legged stool, the line dwindling slowly as
116Professor McGonagall passed the L's.
"Oh hurry up," Ron moaned, massaging his stomach.
"Now, Ron, the Sorting's much more important than food," said Nearly Headless
Nick as "Madley, Laura!" became a Hufflepuff.
"Course it is, if you're dead," snapped Ron.
"I do hope this year's batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch," said Nearly Headless
Nick, applauding as "McDonald, Natalie!" joined the Gryffindor table. "We don't
want to break our winning streak, do we?"
Gryffindor had won the Inter-House Championship for the last three years in a
row.
"Pritchard, Graham!"
"SLYTHERIN!"
"Quirke, Orla!"
"RAVENCLAW!"
And finally, with "Whitby, Kevin!" ("HUFFLEPUFF!"), the Sorting ended.
Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and the stool and carried them away.
"About time," said Ron, seizing his knife and fork and looking expectantly at his
golden plate.
Professor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was smiling around at the
students, his arms opened wide in welcome.
"I have only two words to say to you," he told them, his deep voice echoing
around the Hall. "Tuck in."
"Hear, hear!" said Harry and Ron loudly as the empty dishes filled magically
before their eyes.
Nearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as Harry, Ron, and Hermione loaded
their own plates.
"Aaah, 'at's be'er," said Ron, with his mouth full of mashed potato.
"You're lucky there's a feast at all tonight, you know," said Nearly Headless Nick.
"There was trouble in the kitchens earlier."
"Why? Wha' 'appened?" said Harry, through a sizable chunk of steak.
"Peeves, of course," said Nearly Headless Nick, shaking his head, which wobbled
dangerously. He pulled his ruff a little higher up on his neck. "The usual argument,
you know. He wanted to attend the feast - well, it's quite out of the question, you
117know what he's like, utterly uncivilized, can't see a plate of food without throwing
it. We held a ghost's council - the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance - but
most wisely, in my opinion, the Bloody Baron put his foot down."
The Bloody Baron was the Slytherin ghost, a gaunt and silent specter covered in
silver bloodstains. He was the only person at Hogwarts who could really control
Peeves.
"Yeah, we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about something," said Ron darkly.
"So what did he do in the kitchens?"
"Oh the usual," said Nearly Headless Nick, shrugging. "Wreaked havoc and
mayhem. Pots and pans everywhere. Place swimming in soup. Terrified the house-
elves out of their wits--"
Clang.
Hermione had knocked over her golden goblet. Pumpkin juice spread steadily over
the tablecloth, staining several feet of white linen orange, but Hermione paid no
attention.
"There are house-elves here?" she said, staring, horror-struck, at Nearly Headless
Nick. "Here at Hogwarts?"
"Certainly," said Nearly Headless Nick, looking surprised at her reaction. "The
largest number in any dwelling in Britain, I believe. Over a hundred."
"I've never seen one!" said Hermione.
"Well, they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day, do they?" said Nearly Headless
Nick. "They come out at night to do a bit of cleaning.. . see to the fires and so on..
. . I mean, you're not supposed to see them, are you? That's the mark of a good
house-elf, isn't it, that you don't know it's there?"
Hermione stared at him.
"But they get paid?" she said. "They get holidays, don't they? And - and sick leave,
and pensions, and everything?"
Nearly Headless Nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and his head flopped
off, dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and muscle that still attached it to
his neck.
"Sick leave and pensions?" he said, pushing his head back onto his shoulders and
securing it once more with his ruff. "House-elves don't want sick leave and
pensions!"
Hermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of food, then put her knife and
fork down upon it and pushed it away from her.
"Oh c'mon, 'Er-my-knee," said Ron, accidentally spraying Harry with bits of
118Yorkshire pudding. "Oops -- sorry, 'Arry --" He swallowed. "You won't get them
sick leave by starving yourself!"
"Slave labor," said Hermione, breathing hard through her nose. "That's what made
this dinner. Slave labor."
And she refused to eat another bite.
The rain was still drumming heavily against the high, dark glass. Another clap of
thunder shook the windows, and the stormy ceiling flashed, illuminating the
golden plates as the remains of the first course vanished and were replaced,
instantly, with puddings.
"Treacle tart, Hermione!" said Ron, deliberately wafting its smell toward her.
"Spotted dick, look! Chocolate gateau!"
But Hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of Professor McGonagall that he
gave up.
When the puddings too had been demolished, and the last crumbs had faded off
the plates, leaving them sparkling clean, Albus Dumbledore got to his feet again.
The buzz of chatter filling the Hall ceased almost at once, so that only the howling
wind and pounding rain could be heard.
"So!" said Dumbledore, smiling around at them all. "Now that we are all fed and
watered," ("Hmph!" said Hermione) "I must once more ask for your attention,
while I give out a few notices.
"Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden
inside the castle has this year been extended to include Screaming Yo-yos, Fanged
Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The full list comprises some four
hundred and thirty-seven items, I believe, and can be viewed in Mr. Filch's office,
if anybody would like to check it."
The corners of Dumbledore's mouth twitched. He continued, "As ever, I would
like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is out-of-bounds to students,
as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third year.
"It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter-House Quidditch Cup will
not take place this year."
"What?" Harry gasped. He looked around at Fred and George, his fellow members
of the Quidditch team. They were mouthing soundlessly at Dumbledore,
apparently too appalled to speak. Dumbhedore went on, "This is due to an event
that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout the school year, taking
up much of the teachers' time and energy - but I am sure you will all enjoy it
immensely. I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts -"
But at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of the
Great Hall banged open.
119A man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long staff, shrouded in a black
traveling cloak. Every head in the Great Hall swiveled toward the stranger,
suddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning that flashed across the ceiling.
He lowered his hood, shook out a long mane of grizzled, dark gray hair, then
began to walk up toward the teachers' table.
A dull clunk echoed through the Hall on his every other step. He reached the end
of the top table, turned right, and limped heavily toward Dumbledore. Another
flash of lightning crossed the ceiling. Hermione gasped.
The lightning had thrown the man's face into sharp relief, and it was a face unlike
any Harry had ever seen. It looked as though it had been carved out of weathered
wood by someone who had only the vaguest idea of what human faces are
supposed to look like, and was none too skilled with a chisel. Every inch of skin
seemed to be scarred. The mouth looked like a diagonal gash, and a large chunk of
the nose was missing. But it was the man's eyes that made him frightening.
One of them was small, dark, and beady. The other was large, round as a coin, and
a vivid, electric blue. The blue eye was moving ceaselessly, without blinking, and
was rolling up, down, and from side to side, quite independently of the normal eye
- and then it rolled right over, pointing into the back of the man's head, so that all
they could see was whiteness.
The stranger reached Dumbledore. He stretched out a hand that was as badly
scarred as his face, and Dumbhedore shook it, muttering words Harry couldn't
hear. He seemed to be making some inquiry of the stranger, who shook his head
unsmilingly and replied in an undertone. Dumbledore nodded and gestured the
man to the empty seat on his right-hand side.
The stranger sat down, shook his mane of dark gray hair out of his face, pulled a
plate of sausages toward him, raised it to what was left of his nose, and sniffed it.
He then took a small knife out of his pocket, speared a sausage on the end of it,
and began to eat. His normal eye was fixed upon the sausages, but the blue eye
was still darting restlessly around in its socket, taking in the Hall and the students.
"May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?" said
Dumbledore brightly into the silence. "Professor Moody."
It was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause, but none of the
staff or students chapped except Dumbledore and Hagrid, who both put their
hands together and applauded, but the sound echoed dismally into the silence, and
they stopped fairly quickly. Everyone else seemed too transfixed by Moody's
bizarre appearance to do more than stare at him.
"Moody?" Harry muttered to Ron. "Mad-Eye Moody? The one your dad went to
help this morning?"
"Must be," said Ron in a low, awed voice.
120"What happened to him?" Hermione whispered. "What happened to his face?"
"Dunno," Ron whispered back, watching Moody with fascination.
Moody seemed totally indifferent to his less-than-warm welcome. Ignoring the jug
of pumpkin juice in front of him, he reached again into his traveling cloak, pulled
out a hip flask, and took a long draught from it. As he lifted his arm to drink, his
cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground, and Harry saw, below the table,
several inches of carved wooden leg, ending in a clawed foot.
Dumbledore cleared his throat.
"As I was saying," he said, smiling at the sea of students before him, all of whom
were still gazing transfixed at Mad-Eye Moody, "we are to have the honor of
hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event that has not been
held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the
Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year."
"You're JOKING!" said Fred Weasley loudly.
The tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody's arrival suddenly broke.
Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
"I am not joking, Mr. Weasley," he said, "though now that you mention it, I did
hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a leprechaun who
all go into a bar.
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.
"Er - but maybe this is not the time.. . no. . ." said Dumbledore, "where was I? Ah
yes, the Triwizard Tournament. . . well, some of you will not know what this
tournament involves, so I hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a
short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.
"The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as
a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry:
Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent
each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. The
schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years, and it was
generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young
witches and wizards of different nationalities - until, that is, the death toll mounted
so high that the tournament was discontinued."
"Death toll?" Hermione whispered, looking alarmed. But her anxiety did not seem
to be shared by the majority of students in the Hall; many of them were
whispering excitedly to one another, and Harry himself was far more interested in
hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had happened
hundreds of years ago.
"There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament,"
121Dumbledore continued, "none of which has been very successful. However, our
own departments of International Magical Cooperation and Magical Games and
Sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt. We have worked hard
over the summer to ensure that this time, no champion will find himself or herself
in mortal danger.
"The heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their short-listed
contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions will take place at
Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to
compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a thousand Galleons
personal prize money."
"I'm going for it!" Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with
enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only person
who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At every House
table, Harry could see people either gazing raptly at Dumbledore, or else
whispering fervently to their neighbors. But then Dumbledore spoke again, and the
Hall quieted once more.
"Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts,"
he said, "the heads of the participating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic,
have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year. Only students
who are of age - that is to say, seventeen years or older - will be allowed to put
forward their names for consideration. This" -- Dumbledore raised his voice
slightly, for several people had made noises of outrage at these words, and the
Weasley twins were suddenly looking furious - "is a measure we feel is necessary,
given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever
precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh
year will be able to cope with them. I will personally be ensuring that no underage
student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hog-warts champion."
His light blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over Fred's and George's mutinous
faces. "I therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are
under seventeen.
"The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October
and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know that you will all
extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give
your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected.
And now, it is late, and I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested
as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! Chop chop!"
Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad-Eye Moody. There was a
great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and swarmed toward
the double doors into the entrance hall.
"They can't do that!" said George Weasley, who had not joined the crowd moving
toward the door, but was standing up and glaring at Dumbledore. "We're
seventeen in April, why can't we have a shot?"
122"They're not stopping me entering," said Fred stubbornly, also scowling at the top
table. "The champions'll get to do all sorts of stuff you'd never be allowed to do
normally. And a thousand Galleons prize money!"
"Yeah," said Ron, a faraway look on his face. "Yeah, a thousand Galleons. . ."
"Come on," said Hermione, "we'll be the only ones left here if you don't move."
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George set off for the entrance hall, Fred and
George debating the ways in which Dumbledore might stop those who were under
seventeen from entering the tournament.
"Who's this impartial judge who's going to decide who the champions are?" said
Harry.
"Dunno," said Fred, "but it's them we'll have to fool. I reckon a couple of drops of
Aging Potion might do it, George.. ."
"Dumbledore knows you're not of age, though," said Ron.
"Yeah, but he's not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?" said Fred
shrewdly. "Sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter, he'll
choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are. Dumbledore's
trying to stop us giving our names."
"People have died, though!" said Hermione in a worried voice as they walked
through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up another, narrower
staircase.
"Yeah," said Fred airily, "but that was years ago, wasn't it? Anyway, where's the
fun without a bit of risk? Hey, Ron, what if we find out how to get 'round
Dumbledore? Fancy entering?"
"What d'you reckon?" Ron asked Harry. "Be cool to enter, wouldn't it? But I
s'pose they might want someone older.... Dunno if we've learned enough.. .
"I definitely haven't," came Nevihle's gloomy voice from behind Fred and George.
"I expect my gran'd want me to try, though. She's always going on about how I
should be upholding the family honor. I'll just have to -- oops. . ."
Neville's foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase. There were
many of these trick stairs at Hogwarts; it was second nature to most of the older
students to jump this particular step, but Neville's memory was notoriously poor.
Harry and Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out, while a suit of
armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily.
"Shut it, you," said Ron, banging down its visor as they passed. They made their
way up to the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, which was concealed behind a large
portrait of a fat lady in a pink silk dress.
123"Password?" she said as they approached.
"Balderdash," said George, "a prefect downstairs told me."
The portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall through which they all
climbed. A crackling fire warmed the circular common room, which was full of
squashy armchairs and tables. Hermione cast the merrily dancing flames a dark
look, and Harry distinctly heard her mutter "Slave labor" before bidding them
good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls' dormitory.
Harry, Ron, and Neville climbed up the last, spiral staircase until they reached
their own dormitory, which was situated at the top of the tower. Five four-poster
beds with deep crimson hangings stood against the walls, each with its owner's
trunk at the foot. Dean and Seamus were already getting into bed; Seamus had
pinned his Ireland rosette to his headboard, and Dean had tacked up a poster of
Viktor Krum over his bedside table. His old poster of the West Ham football team
was pinned right next to it.
"Mental," Ron sighed, shaking his head at the completely stationary soccer
players.
Harry, Ron, and Neville got into their pajamas and into bed. Someone - a house-
elf, no doubt - had placed warming pans between the sheets. It was extremely
comfortable, lying there in bed and listening to the storm raging outside.
"I might go in for it, you know," Ron said sleepily through the darkness, "if Fred
and George find out how to. . . the tournament. . . you never know, do you?"
"S'pose not. .. ."
Harry rolled over in bed, a series of dazzling new pictures forming in his mind's
eye. . . . He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen. .
. he had become Hogwarts champion. . . he was standing on the grounds, his arms
raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and
screaming. . . he had just won the Triwizard Tournament. Cho's face stood out
particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face glowing with admiration....
Harry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that Ron couldn't see what he
could.
124CHAPTER THIRTEEN - MAD-EYE MOODY
The storm had blown itself out by the following morning, though the ceiling in the
Great Hall was still gloomy; heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead as
Harry, Ron, and Hermione examined their new course schedules at breakfast. A
few seats along, Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were discussing magical methods
of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the Triwizard Tournament.
"Today's not bad.. . outside all morning," said Ron, who was running his finger
down the Monday column of his schedule. "Herbology with the Hufflepuffs and
Care of Magical Creatures... damn it, we're still with the Slytherins. . . ."
"Double Divination this afternoon," Harry groaned, looking down. Divination was
his least favorite subject, apart from Potions. Professor Trelawney kept predicting
Harry's death, which he found extremely annoying.
"You should have given it up like me, shouldn't you?" said Hermione briskly,
buttering herself some toast. "Then you'd be doing something sensible like
Arithmancy."
"You're eating again, I notice," said Ron, watching Hermione adding liberal
amounts of jam to her toast too.
"I've decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights," said
Hermione haughtily.
"Yeah. . . and you were hungry," said Ron, grinning.
There was a sudden rustling noise above them, and a hundred owls came soaring
through the open windows carrying the morning mail. Instinctively, Harry looked
up, but there was no sign of white among the mass of brown and gray. The owls
circled the tables, looking for the people to whom their letters and packages were
addressed. A large tawny owl soared down to Neville Longbottom and deposited a
parcel into his lap - Neville almost always forgot to pack something. On the other
side of the Hall Draco Malfoy's eagle owl had landed on his shoulder, carrying
what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home. Trying to
ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach, Harry returned to his
porridge. Was it possible that something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius
hadn't even got his letter?
His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they
arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout
showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less
like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each
was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which
appeared to be full of liquid.
125"Bubotubers," Professor Sprout told them briskly. "They need squeezing. You will
collect the pus -"
"The what?" said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.
"Pus, Finnigan, pus," said Professor Sprout, "and it's extremely valuable, so don't
waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon-hide
gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus."
Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling
was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst forth, which
smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had
indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.
"This'll keep Madam Pomfrey happy," said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last
bottle with a cork. "An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne,
bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid
themselves of pimples."
"Like poor Eloise Midgen," said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a hushed voice.
"She tried to curse hers off."
"Silly girl," said Professor Sprout, shaking her head. "But Madam Pomfrey fixed
her nose back on in the end."
A booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds, signaling the end
of the lesson, and the class separated; the Hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for
Transfiguration, and the Gryffindors heading in the other direction, down the
sloping lawn toward Hagrid's small wooden cabin, which stood on the edge of the
Forbidden Forest.
Hagrid was standing outside his hut, one hand on the collar of his enormous black
boarhound, Fang. There were several open wooden crates on the ground at his
feet, and Fang was whimpering and straining at his collar, apparently keen to
investigate the contents more closely. As they drew nearer, an odd rattling noise
reached their ears, punctuated by what sounded like minor explosions.
"Mornin'!" Hagrid said, grinning at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. "Be'er wait fer the
Slytherins, they won' want ter miss this - Blast-Ended Skrewts!"
"Come again?" said Ron.
Hagrid pointed down into the crates.
"Eurgh!" squealed Lavender Brown, jumping backward. "Eurgh" just about
summed up the Blast-Ended Skrewts in Harry's opinion. They looked like
deformed, shell-less lobsters, horribly pale and slimy-looking, with legs sticking
out in very odd places and no visible heads. There were about a hundred of them
in each crate, each about six inches long, crawling over one another, bumping
blindly into the sides of the boxes. They were giving off a very powerful smell of
126rotting fish. Every now and then, sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt, and
with a small phut, it would be propelled forward several inches.
"On'y jus' hatched," said Hagrid proudly, "so yeh'll be able ter raise 'em yerselves!
Thought we'd make a bit of a project of it!"
"And why would we want to raise them?" said a cold voice.
The Slytherins had arrived. The speaker was Draco Malfoy. Crabbe and Goyle
were chuckling appreciatively at his words.
Hagrid looked stumped at the question.
"I mean, what do they do?" asked Malfoy. "What is the point of them?"
Hagrid opened his mouth, apparently thinking hard; there was a few seconds'
pause, then he said roughly, "Tha's next lesson, Malfoy. Yer jus' feedin' 'em today.
Now, yeh'll wan' ter try 'em on a few diff'rent things - I've never had 'em before,
not sure what they'll go fer - I got ant eggs an' frog livers an' a bit o' grass snake -
just try 'em out with a bit of each."
"First pus and now this," muttered Seamus.
Nothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry, Ron, and Hermione
pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the
Blast-Ended Skrewts. Harry couldn't suppress the suspicion that the whole thing
was entirely pointless, because the skrewts didn't seem to have mouths.
"Ouch!" yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes. "It got me."
Hagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious.
"Its end exploded!" said Dean angrily, showing Hagrid a burn on his hand.
"Ah, yeah, that can happen when they blast off," said Hagrid, nodding.
"Eurgh!" said Lavender Brown again. "Eurgh, Hagrid, what's that pointy thing on
it?"
"Ah, some of 'em have got stings," said Hagrid enthusiastically (Lavender quickly
withdrew her hand from the box). "I reckon they're the males. . . . The females've
got sorta sucker things on their bellies. . . . I think they might be ter suck blood."
"Well, I can certainly see why we're trying to keep them alive," said Malfoy
sarcastically. "Who wouldn't want pets that can burn, sting, and bite all at once?"
"Just because they're not very pretty, it doesn't mean they're not useful," Hermione
snapped. "Dragon blood's amazingly magical, but you wouldn't want a dragon for
a pet, would you?"
Harry and Ron grinned at Hagrid, who gave them a furtive smile from behind his
127bushy beard. Hagrid would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon, as Harry,
Ron, and Hermione knew only too well - he had owned one for a brief period
during their first year, a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of Norbert.
Hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures, the more lethal, the better.
"Well, at least the skrewts are small," said Ron as they made their way back up to
the castle for lunch an hour later.
"They are now," said Hermione in an exasperated voice, "but once Hagrid's found
out what they eat, I expect they'll be six feet long."
"Well, that won't matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something, will it?"
said Ron, grinning slyly at her.
"You know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up," said Hermione. "As
a matter of fact I think he's right. The best thing to do would be to stamp on the lot
of them before they start attacking us all."
They sat down at the Gryffindor table and helped themselves to lamb chops and
potatoes. Hermione began to eat so fast that Harry and Ron stared at her.
"Er - is this the new stand on elf rights?" said Ron. "You're going to make yourself
puke instead?"
"No," said Hermione, with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth
bulging with sprouts. "I just want to get to the library."
"What?" said Ron in disbelief. "Hermione - it's the first day back! We haven't even
got homework yet!"
Hermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her food as though she had not
eaten for days. Then she leapt to her feet, said, "See you at dinner!" and departed
at high speed.
When the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons, Harry and Ron set off
for North Tower where, at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase, a silver
stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling, and the room where Professor
Trelawney lived.
The familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire met their nostrils as they
emerged at the top of the stepladder. As ever, the curtains were all closed; the
circular room was bathed in a dim reddish light cast by the many lamps, which
were all draped with scarves and shawls. Harry and Ron walked through the mass
of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room, and sat down at the
same small circular table.
"Good day," said the misty voice of Professor Trelawney right behind Harry,
making him jump.
A very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too large
128for her face, Professor Trelawney was peering down at Harry with the tragic
expression she always wore whenever she saw him. The usual large amount of
beads, chains, and bangles glittered upon her person in the firelight.
"You are preoccupied, my dear," she said mournfully to Harry. "My inner eye sees
past your brave face to the troubled soul within. And I regret to say that your
worries are not baseless. I see difficult times ahead for you, alas. . . most difficult..
. I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass. . . and perhaps sooner than
you think..."
Her voice dropped almost to a whisper. Ron rolled his eyes at Harry, who looked
stonily back. Professor Trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a large
winged armchair before the fire, facing the class. Lavender Brown and Parvati
Patil, who deeply admired Professor Trelawney, were sitting on poufs very close
to her.
"My dears, it is time for us to consider the stars," she said. "The movements of the
planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the
steps of the celestial dance. Human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary
rays, which intermingle. . ."
But Harry's thoughts had drifted. The perfumed fire always made him feel sleepy
and dull-witted, and Professor Trelawney's rambling talks on fortune-telling never
held him exactly spellbound - though he couldn't help thinking about what she had
just said to him. "I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass...'"
But Hermione was right, Harry thought irritably, Professor Trelawney really was
an old fraud. He wasn't dreading anything at the moment at all. . . well, unless you
counted his fears that Sirius had been caught. . . but what did Professor Trelawney
know? He had long since come to the conclusion that her brand of fortunetelling
was really no more than lucky guesswork and a spooky manner.
Except, of course, for that time at the end of last term, when she had made the
prediction about Voldemort rising again. . . and Dumbledore himself had said that
he thought that trance had been genuine, when Harry had described it to him.
"Harry!" Ron muttered.
"What?"
Harry looked around; the whole class was staring at him. He sat up straight; he had
been almost dozing off, lost in the heat and his thoughts.
"I was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of
Saturn," said Professor Trelawney, a faint note of resentment in her voice at the
fact that he had obviously not been hanging on her words.
"Born under - what, sorry?" said Harry.
"Saturn, dear, the planet Saturn!" said Professor Trelawney, sounding definitely
129irritated that he wasn't riveted by this news. "I was saying that Saturn was surely in
a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your birth. . . . Your dark hair.
. . your mean stature...tragic losses so young in life. . . I think I am right in saying,
my dear, that you were born in midwinter?"
"No," said Harry, "I was born in July."
Ron hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough.
Half an hour later, each of them had been given a complicated circular chart, and
was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment of birth. It was
dull work, requiring much consultation of timetables and calculation of angles.
"I've got two Neptunes here," said Harry after a while, frowning down at his piece
of parchment, "that can't be right, can it?"
"Aaaaah," said Ron, imitating Professor Trelawney's mystical whisper, "when two
Neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born,
Harry. . . ."
Seamus and Dean, who were working nearby, sniggered loudly, though not loudly
enough to mask the excited squeals from Lavender Brown - "Oh Professor, look! I
think I've got an unaspected planet! Oooh, which one's that, Professor?"
"It is Uranus, my dear," said Professor Trelawney, peering down at the chart.
"Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?" said Ron.
Most unfortunately, Professor Trelawney heard him, and it was this, perhaps, that
made her give them so much homework at the end of the class.
"A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will
affect you, with reference to your personal chart," she snapped, sounding much
more like Professor McGonagall than her usual airy-fairy self. "I want it ready to
hand in next Monday, and no excuses!"
"Miserable old bat," said Ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the
staircases back to the Great Hall and dinner. "That'll take all weekend, that will. .
."
"Lots of homework?" said Hermione brightly, catching up with them. "Professor
Vector didn't give us any at all!"
"Well, bully for Professor Vector," said Ron moodily.
They reached the entrance hall, which was packed with people queuing for dinner.
They had just joined the end of the line, when a loud voice rang out behind them.
"Weasley! Hey, Weasley!"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing
130there, each looking thoroughly pleased about something.
"What?" said Ron shortly.
"Your dad's in the paper, Weasley!" said Malfoy, brandishing a copy of the Daily
Prophet and speaking very loudly, so that everyone in the packed entrance hall
could hear. "Listen to this!
FURTHER MISTAKES AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
It seems as though the Ministry of Magic's troubles are not yet at an end, writes
Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. Recently under fire for its poor
crowd control at the Quidditch World Cup, and still unable to account for the
disappearance of one of its witches, the Ministry was plunged into fresh
embarrassment yesterday by the antics of Arnold Weasley, of the Misuse of
Muggle Artifacts Office."
Malfoy looked up.
"Imagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley. It's almost as though he's
a complete nonentity, isn't it?" he crowed.
Everyone in the entrance hall was listening now. Malfoy straightened the paper
with a flourish and read on:
Arnold Weasley, who was charged with possession of a flying car two years ago,
was yesterday involved in a tussle with several Muggle law-keepers ("policemen")
over a number of highly aggressive dustbins. Mr. Weasley appears to have rushed
to the aid of "Mad-Eye" Moody, the aged ex-Auror who retired from the Ministry
when no longer able to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted
murder. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Weasley found, upon arrival at Mr. Moody's heavily
guarded house, that Mr. Moody had once again raised a false alarm. Mr. Weasley
was forced to modify several memories before he could escape from the
policemen, but refused to answer Daily Prophet questions about why he had
involved the Ministry in such an undignified and potentially embarrassing scene.
"And there's a picture, Weasley!" said Malfoy, flipping the paper over and holding
it up. "A picture of your parents outside their house - if you can call it a house!
Your mother could do with losing a bit of weight, couldn't she?"
Ron was shaking with fury. Everyone was staring at him.
"Get stuffed, Malfoy," said Harry. "C'mon, Ron. . ."
"Oh yeah, you were staying with them this summer, weren't you, Potter?" sneered
Malfoy. "So tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?"
"You know your mother, Malfoy?" said Harry - both he and Hermione had
grabbed the back of Ron's robes to stop him from launching himself at Malfoy -
131"that expression she's got, like she's got dung under her nose? Has she always
looked like that, or was it just because you were with her?"
Malfoy's pale face went slightly pink.
"Don't you dare insult my mother, Potter."
"Keep your fat mouth shut, then," said Harry, turning away.
BANG!
Several people screamed - Harry felt something white-hot graze the side of his
face - he plunged his hand into his robes for his wand, but before he'd even
touched it, he heard a second loud BANG, and a roar that echoed through the
entrance hall.
"OH NO YOU DON'T, LADDIE!"
Harry spun around. Professor Moody was limping down the marble staircase. His
wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret, which was shivering
on the stone-flagged floor, exactly where Malfoy had been standing.
There was a terrified silence in the entrance hall. Nobody but Moody was moving
a muscle. Moody turned to look at Harry -- at least, his normal eye was looking at
Harry; the other one was pointing into the back of his head.
"Did he get you?" Moody growled. His voice was low and gravelly.
"No," said Harry, "missed."
"LEAVE IT!" Moody shouted.
"Leave - what?" Harry said, bewildered.
"Not you - him!" Moody growled, jerking his thumb over his shoulder at Crabbe,
who had just frozen, about to pick up the white ferret. It seemed that Moody's
rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his head.
Moody started to limp toward Crabbe, Goyle, and the ferret, which gave a terrified
squeak and took off, streaking toward the dungeons.
"I don't think so!" roared Moody, pointing his wand at the ferret again - it flew ten
feet into the air, fell with a smack to the floor, and then bounced upward once
more.
"I don't like people who attack when their opponent's back's turned," growled
Moody as the ferret bounced higher and higher, squealing in pain. "Stinking,
cowardly, scummy thing to do..."
The ferret flew through the air, its legs and tail flailing helplessly.
"Never - do - that - again -" said Moody, speaking each word as the ferret hit the
132stone floor and bounced upward again.
"Professor Moody!" said a shocked voice.
Professor McGonagall was coming down the marble staircase with her arms full of
books.
"Hello, Professor McGonagall," said Moody calmly, bouncing the ferret still
higher.
"What - what are you doing?" said Professor McGonagall, her eyes following the
bouncing ferret's progress through the air.
"Teaching," said Moody.
"Teach - Moody, is that a student?" shrieked Professor McGonagall, the books
spilling out of her arms.
"Yep," said Moody.
"No!" cried Professor McGonagall, running down the stairs and pulling out her
wand; a moment later, with a loud snapping noise, Draco Malfoy had reappeared,
lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly
pink face. He got to his feet, wincing.
"Moody, we never use Transfiguration as a punishment!" said Professor
McGonagall wealdy. "Surely Professor Dumbledore told you that?"
"He might've mentioned it, yeah," said Moody, scratching his chin unconcernedly,
"but I thought a good sharp shock -"
"We give detentions, Moody! Or speak to the offender's Head of House!"
"I'll do that, then," said Moody, staring at Malfoy with great dislike.
Malfoy, whose pale eyes were still watering with pain and humiliation, looked
malevolently up at Moody and muttered something in which the words "my
father" were distinguishable.
"Oh yeah?" said Moody quietly, limping forward a few steps, the dull clunk of his
wooden leg echoing around the hall. "Well, I know your father of old, boy... . You
tell him Moody's keeping a close eye on his son. . . you tell him that from me. . . .
Now, your Head of House'll be Snape, will it?"
"Yes," said Malfoy resentfully.
"Another old friend," growled Moody. "I've been looking forward to a chat with
old Snape. . . . Come on, you. . ."
And he seized Malfoy's upper arm and marched him off toward the dungeons.
Professor McGonagall stared anxiously after them for a few moments, then waved
133her wand at her fallen books, causing them to soar up into the air and back into her
arms.
"Don't talk to me," Ron said quietly to Harry and Hermione as they sat down at the
Gryffindor table a few minutes later, surrounded by excited talk on all sides about
what had just happened.
"Why not?" said Hermione in surprise.
"Because I want to fix that in my memory forever," said Ron, his eyes closed and
an uplifted expression on his face. "Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret."
Harry and Hermione both laughed, and Hermione began doling beef casserole
onto each of their plates.
"He could have really hurt Malfoy, though," she said. "It was good, really, that
Professor McGonagall stopped it -"
"Hermione!" said Ron furiously, his eyes snapping open again, "you're ruining the
best moment of my life!"
Hermione made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed again.
"Don't tell me you're going back to the library this evening?" said Harry, watching
her.
"Got to," said Hermione thickly. "Loads to do."
"But you told us Professor Vector -"
"It's not schoolwork," she said. Within five minutes, she had cleared her plate and
departed. No sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by Fred Weasley.
"Moody!" he said. "How cool is he?"
"Beyond cool," said George, sitting down opposite Fred. "Supercool," said the
twins' best friend, Lee Jordan, sliding into the seat beside George. "We had him
this afternoon," he told Harry and Ron.
"What was it like?" said Harry eagerly.
Fred, George, and Lee exchanged looks full of meaning.
"Never had a lesson like it," said Fred.
"He knows, man," said Lee.
"Knows what?" said Ron, leaning forward.
"Knows what it's like to be out there doing it," said George impressively.
"Doing what?" said Harry.
134"Fighting the Dark Arts," said Fred.
"He's seen it all," said George.
"Mazing," said Lee.
Ron dived into his bag for his schedule.
"We haven't got him till Thursday!" he said in a disappointed voice.
135CHAPTER FOURTEEN - THE UNFORGIVABLE CURSES
The next two days passed without great incident, unless you counted Neville
melting his sixth cauldron in Potions. Professor Snape, who seemed to have
attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer, gave Nevihle detention,
and Neville returned from it in a state of nervous collapse, having been made to
disembowel a barrel full of horned toads.
"You know why Snape's in such a foul mood, don't you?" said Ron to Harry as
they watched Hermione teaching Neville a Scouring Charm to remove the frog
guts from under his fingernails.
"Yeah," said Harry. "Moody."
It was common knowledge that Snape really wanted the Dark Arts job, and he had
now failed to get it for the fourth year running. Snape had disliked all of their
previous Dark Arts teachers, and shown it - but he seemed strangely wary of
displaying overt animosity to Mad-Eye Moody. Indeed, whenever Harry saw the
two of them together - at mealtimes, or when they passed in the corridors - he had
the distinct impression that Snape was avoiding Moody's eye, whether magical or
normal.
"I reckon Snape's a bit scared of him, you know," Harry said thoughtfully.
"Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad," said Ron, his eyes misting
over, "and bounced him all around his dungeon..."
The Gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to Moody's first lesson so much
that they arrived early on Thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his
classroom before the bell had even rung. The only person missing was Hermione,
who turned up just in time for the lesson.
"Been in the -"
"Library." Harry finished her sentence for her. "C'mon, quick, or we won't get
decent seats."
They hurried into three chairs right in front of the teacher's desk, took out their
copies of The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection, and waited, unusually
quiet. Soon they heard Moody's distinctive clunking footsteps coming down the
corridor, and he entered the room, looking as strange and frightening as ever. They
could just see his clawed, wooden foot protruding from underneath his robes.
"You can put those away," he growled, stumping over to his desk and sitting
down, "those books. You won't need them."
They returned the books to their bags, Ron looking excited.
136Moody took out a register, shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair out of his
twisted and scarred face, and began to call out names, his normal eye moving
steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around, fixing upon each
student as he or she answered.
"Right then," he said, when the last person had declared themselves present, "I've
had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class. Seems you've had a pretty
thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures - you've covered boggarts, Red
Caps, hinkypunks, grindylows, Kappas, and werewolves, is that right?"
There was a general murmur of assent.
"But you're behind - very behind - on dealing with curses," said Moody. "So I'm
here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other. I've got one
year to teach you how to deal with Dark -"
"What, aren't you staying?" Ron blurted out.
Moody's magical eye spun around to stare at Ron; Ron looked extremely
apprehensive, but after a moment Moody smiled - the first time Harry had seen
him do so. The effect was to make his heavily scarred face look more twisted and
contorted than ever, but it was nevertheless good to know that he ever did
anything as friendly as smile. Ron looked deeply relieved.
"You'll be Arthur Weasley's son, eh?" Moody said. "Your father got me out of a
very tight corner a few days ago. .. . Yeah, I'm staying just the one year. Special
favor to Dumbledore. . . . One year, and then back to my quiet retirement."
He gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled hands together.
"So - straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths and forms. Now,
according to the Ministry of Magic, I'm supposed to teach you countercurses and
leave it at that. I'm not supposed to show you what illegal Dark curses look like
until you're in the sixth year. You're not supposed to be old enough to deal with it
till then. But Professor Dumbledore's got a higher opinion of your nerves, he
reckons you can cope, and I say, the sooner you know what you're up against, the
better. How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you've never
seen? A wizard who's about to put an illegal curse on you isn't going to tell you
what he's about to do. He's not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You
need to be prepared. You need to be alert and watchful. You need to put that away,
Miss Brown, when I'm talking."
Lavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing Parvati her completed
horoscope under the desk. Apparently Moody's magical eye could see through
solid wood, as well as out of the back of his head.
"So. . . do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding
law?"
137Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron's and Hermione's. Moody
pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender.
"Er," said Ron tentatively, "my dad told me about one.. . . Is it called the Imperius
Curse, or something?"
"Ah, yes," said Moody appreciatively. "Your father would know that one. Gave
the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse."
Moody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and took out a
glass jar. Three large black spiders were scuttling around inside it. Harry felt Ron
recoil slightly next to him - Ron hated spiders.
Moody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders, and held it in the palm of
his hand so that they could all see it. He then pointed his wand at it and muttered,
"Imperio!"
The spider leapt from Moody's hand on a fine thread of silk and began to swing
backward and forward as though on a trapeze. It stretched out its legs rigidly, then
did a back flip, breaking the thread and landing on the desk, where it began to
cartwheel in circles. Moody jerked his wand, and the spider rose onto two of its
hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap dance.
Everyone was laughing - everyone except Moody.
"Think it's funny, do you?" he growled. "You'd like it, would you, if I did it to
you?"
The laughter died away almost instantly.
"Total control," said Moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began to roll
over and over. "I could make it jump out of the window, drown itself, throw itself
down one of your throats. . ."
Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
"Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the
Imperius Curse," said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the days in
which Voldemort had been all-powerful. "Some job for the Ministry, trying to sort
out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their own free will.
"The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I'll be teaching you how, but it takes real
strength of character, and not everyone's got it. Better avoid being hit with it if you
can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!" he barked, and everyone jumped.
Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar.
"Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?"
Hermione's hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry's slight surprise, did
Neville's. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered information was
138Herbology which was easily his best subject. Neville looked surprised at his own
daring.
"Yes?" said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to fix on Neville.
"There's one - the Cruciatus Curse," said Neville in a small but distinct voice.
Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes.
"Your name's Longbottom?" he said, his magical eye swooping down to check the
register again.
Neville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further inquiries. Turning back to
the class at large, he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the
desktop, where it remained motionless, apparently too scared to move.
"The Cruciatus Curse," said Moody. "Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the
idea," he said, pointing his wand at the spider. "Engorgio!"
The spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning all pretense,
Ron pushed his chair backward, as far away from Moody's desk as possible.
Moody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered, "Crucio!"
At once, the spider's legs bent in upon its body; it rolled over and began to twitch
horribly, rocking from side to side. No sound came from it, but Harry was sure
that if it could have given voice, it would have been screaming. Moody did not
remove his wand, and the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently - "Stop
it!" Hermione said shrilly."
Harry looked around at her. She was looking, not at the spider, but at Neville, and
Harry, following her gaze, saw that Neville's hands were clenched upon the desk
in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified.
Moody raised his wand. The spider's legs relaxed, but it continued to twitch.
"Reducio," Moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper size. He put
it back into the jar.
"Pain," said Moody softly. "You don't need thumbscrews or knives to torture
someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse. . . . That one was very popular
once too.
"Right. . . anyone know any others?"
Harry looked around. From the looks on everyone's faces, he guessed they were all
wondering what was going to happen to the last spider. Hermione's hand shook
slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into the air.
"Yes?" said Moody, looking at her.
139"Avada Kedavra," Hermione whispered.
Several people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron.
"Ah," said Moody, another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth. "Yes, the last
and worst. Avada Kedavra. .. the Killing Curse."
He put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as though it knew what was coming,
the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar, trying to evade
Moody's fingers, but he trapped it, and placed it upon the desktop. It started to
scuttle frantically across the wooden surface.
Moody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding.
"Avada Kedavra!" Moody roared.
There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a vast,
invisible something was soaring through the air - instantaneously the spider rolled
over onto its back, unmarked, but unmistakably dead. Several of the students
stifled cries; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as
the spider skidded toward him.
Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.
"Not nice," he said calmly. "Not pleasant. And there's no countercurse. There's no
blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he's sitting right in
front of me."
Harry felt his face redden as Moody's eyes (both of them) looked into his own. He
could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry stared at the blank
blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at all....
So that was how his parents had died. . . exactly like that spider. Had they been
unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green light and
heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their bodies?
Harry had been picturing his parents' deaths over and over again for three years
now, ever since he'd found out they had been murdered, ever since he'd found out
what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents' whereabouts to
Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How Voldemort had
killed Harry's father first. How James Potter had tried to hold him off, while he
shouted at his wife to take Harry and run. . . Voldemort had advanced on Lily
Potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill Harry.. . how she had begged
him to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son.. . and so Voldemort had
murdered her too, before turning his wand on Harry.
Harry knew these details because he had heard his parents' voices when he had
fought the dementors last year - for that was the terrible power of the dementors:
to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives, and drown,
powerless, in their own despair.
140Moody was speaking again, from a great distance, it seemed to Harry. With a
massive effort, he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what Moody
was saying.
"Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it - you could
all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt
I'd get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you
how to do it.
"Now, if there's no countercurse, why am I showing you? Because you've got to
know. You've got to appreciate what the worst is. You don't want to find yourself
in a situation where you're facing it. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!" he roared, and
the whole class jumped again.
"Now. . . those three curses - Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus - are known
as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being
is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That's what you're up against. That's
what I've got to teach you to fight. You need preparing. You need arming. But
most of all, you need to practice constant, never-ceasing vigilance. Get out your
quills. . . copy this down. . . ."
They spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the Unforgivable Curses.
No one spoke until the bell rang - but when Moody had dismissed them and they
had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst forth. Most people were discussing
the curses in awed voices - "Did you see it twitch?" "- and when he killed it - just
like that!"
They were talking about the lesson, Harry thought, as though it had been some sort
of spectacular show, but he hadn't found it very entertaining - and nor, it seemed,
had Hermione.
"Hurry up," she said tensely to Harry and Ron.
"Not the ruddy library again?" said Ron.
"No," said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side passage. "Neville." Neville was
standing alone, halfway up the passage, staring at the stone wall opposite him with
the same horrified, wide-eyed look he had worn when Moody had demonstrated
the Cruciatus Curse.
"Neville?" Hermione said gently.
Neville looked around.
"Oh hello," he said, his voice much higher than usual. "Interesting lesson, wasn't
it? I wonder what's for dinner, I'm - I'm starving, aren't you?"
"Neville, are you all right?" said Hermione.
"Oh yes, I'm fine," Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice. "Very
141interesting dinner - I mean lesson - what's for eating?"
Ron gave Harry a startled look.
"Neville, what - ?"
But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see Professor
Moody limping toward them. All four of them fell silent, watching him
apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler growl than
they had yet heard.
"It's all right, sonny," he said to Neville. "Why don't you come up to my office?
Come on. . . we can have a cup of tea. . . ."
Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody. He neither
moved nor spoke. Moody turned his magical eye upon Harry.
"You all right, are you, Potter?"
"Yes," said Harry, almost defiantly.
Moody's blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed Harry. Then he
said, "You've got to know. It seems harsh, maybe, but you've got to know. No
point pretending. . . well.. . come on, Longbottom, I've got some books that might
interest you."
Neville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but they didn't say
anything, so Neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away, one of
Moody's gnarled hands on his shoulder.
"What was that about?" said Ron, watching Neville and Moody turn the corner.
"I don't know," said Hermione, looking pensive.
"Some lesson, though, eh?" said Ron to Harry as they set off for the Great Hall.
"Fred and George were right, weren't they? He really knows his stuff, Moody,
doesn't he? When he did Avada Kedavra, the way that spider just died, just snuffed
it right -"
But Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry's face and didn't speak again until
they reached the Great Hall, when he said he supposed they had better make a start
on Professor Trelawney's predictions tonight, since they would take hours.
Hermione did not join in with Harry and Ron's conversation during dinner, but ate
furiously fast, and then left for the library again. Harry and Ron walked back to
Gryffindor Tower, and Harry, who had been thinking of nothing else all through
dinner, now raised the subject of the Unforgivable Curses himself.
"Wouldn't Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if they knew
we'd seen the curses?" Harry asked as they approached the Fat Lady.
142"Yeah, probably," said Ron. "But Dumbledore's always done things his way, hasn't
he, and Moody's been getting in trouble for years, I reckon. Attacks first and asks
questions later - look at his dustbins. Balderdash."
The Fat Lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole, and they climbed into the
Gryffindor common room, which was crowded and noisy.
"Shall we get our Divination stuff, then?" said Harry.
"I s'pose," Ron groaned.
They went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts, to find Neville there
alone, sitting on his bed, reading. He looked a good deal calmer than at the end of
Moody's lesson, though still not entirely normal. His eyes were rather red.
"You all right, Neville?" Harry asked him.
"Oh yes," said Neville, "I'm fine, thanks. Just reading this book Professor Moody
lent me. . ."
He held up the book: Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean.
"Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I'm really good at
Herbology," Neville said. There was a faint note of pride in his voice that Harry
had rarely heard there before. "He thought I'd like this."
Telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry thought, had been a very
tactful way of cheering Neville up, for Neville very rarely heard that he was good
at anything. It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have done.
Harry and Ron took their copies of Unfogging the Future back down to the
common room, found a table, and set to work on their predictions for the coming
month. An hour later, they had made very little progress, though their table was
littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols, and Harry's brain was as
fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney's
fire.
"I haven't got a clue what this lot's supposed to mean," he said, staring down at a
long list of calculations.
"You know," said Ron, whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run
his fingers through it in frustration, "I think it's back to the old Divination
standby."
"What - make it up?"
"Yeah," said Ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table, dipping his
pen into some ink, and starting to write.
"Next Monday," he said as he scribbled, "I am likely to develop a cough, owing to
the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter." He looked up at Harry. "You know
143her - just put in loads of misery, she'll lap it up."
"Right," said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of
a group of chattering first years into the fire. "Okay. . . on Monday, I will be in
danger of- er - burns."
"Yeah, you will be," said Ron darkly, "we're seeing the skrewts again on Monday.
Okay, Tuesday, I'll. . . erm. .
"Lose a treasured possession," said Harry, who was flicking through Unfogging
the Future for ideas.
"Good one," said Ron, copying it down. "Because of... erm. . . Mercury. Why
don't you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend?"
"Yeah. . . cool. . ." said Harry, scribbling it down, "because... Venus is in the
twelfth house."
"And on Wednesday, I think I'll come off worst in a fight."
"Aaah, I was going to have a fight. Okay, I'll lose a bet."
"Yeah, you'll be betting I'll win my fight. ..
They continued to make up predictions (which grew steadily more tragic) for
another hour, while the common room around them slowly emptied as people
went up to bed. Crookshanks wandered over to them, leapt lightly into an empty
chair, and stared inscrutably at Harry, rather as Hermione might look if she knew
they weren't doing their homework properly.
Staring around the room, trying to think of a kind of misfortune he hadn't yet used,
Harry saw Fred and George sitting together against the opposite wall, heads
together, quills out, poring over a single piece of parchment. It was most unusual
to see Fred and George hidden away in a corner and working silently; they usually
liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention. There was
something secretive about the way they were working on the piece of parchment,
and Harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at
the Burrow. He had thought then that it was another order form for Weasleys'
Wizard Wheezes, but it didn't look like that this time; if it had been, they would
surely have let Lee Jordan in on the joke. He wondered whether it had anything to
do with entering the Triwizard Tournament.
As Harry watched, George shook his head at Fred, scratched out something with
his quill, and said, in a very quiet voice that nevertheless carried across the almost
deserted room, "No - that sounds like we're accusing him. Got to be careful. . ."
Then George looked over and saw Harry watching him. Harry grinned and quickly
returned to his predictions - he didn't want George to think he was eavesdropping.
Shortly after that, the twins rolled up their parchment, said good night, and went
off to bed.
144Fred and George had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened
and Hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in
one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other.
Crookshanks arched his back, purring.
"Hello," she said, "I've just finished!"
"So have I!" said Ron triumphantly, throwing down his quill.
Hermione sat down, laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair, and
pulled Ron's predictions toward her.
"Not going to have a very good month, are you?" she said sardonically as
Crookshanks curled up in her lap.
"Ah well, at least I'm forewarned," Ron yawned.
"You seem to be drowning twice," said Hermione.
"Oh am I?" said Ron, peering down at his predictions. "I'd better change one of
them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff."
"Don't you think it's a bit obvious you've made these up?" said Hermione.
"How dare you!" said Ron, in mock outrage. "We've been working like house-
elves here!"
Hermione raised her eyebrows.
"It's just an expression," said Ron hastily.
Harry laid down his quill too, having just finished predicting his own death by
decapitation.
"What's in the box?" he asked, pointing at it.
"Funny you should ask," said Hermione, with a nasty look at Ron. She took off the
lid and showed them the contents.
Inside were about fifty badges, all of different colors, but all bearing the same
letters: S. P. E .W.
"Spew?" said Harry, picking up a badge and looking at it. "What's this about?"
"Not spew," said Hermione impatiently. "It's S-P-E-W. Stands for the Society for
the Promotion of Elfish Welfare."
"Never heard of it," said Ron.
"Well, of course you haven't," said Hermione briskly, "I've only just started it."
"Yeah?" said Ron in mild surprise. "How many members have you got?"
145"Well - if you two join - three," said Hermione.
"And you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying 'spew,' do you?"
said Ron.
"S-P-E-W!" said Hermione hotly. "I was going to put Stop the Outrageous Abuse
of Our Fellow Magical Creatures and Campaign for a Change in Their Legal
Status - but it wouldn't fit. So that's the heading of our manifesto."
She brandished the sheaf of parchment at them.
"I've been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf enslavement goes back
centuries. I can't believe no one's done anything about it before now."
"Hermione - open your ears," said Ron loudly. "They. Like. It. They like being
enslaved!"
"Our short-term aims," said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and
acting as though she hadn't heard a word, "are to secure house-elves fair wages
and working conditions. Our long-term aims include changing the law about non-
wand use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and
Control of Magical Creatures, because they're shockingly underrepresented."
"And how do we do all this?" Harry asked.
"We start by recruiting members," said Hermione happily. "I thought two Sickles
to join - that buys a badge - and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign.
You're treasurer, Ron - I've got you a collecting tin upstairs - and Harry, you're
secretary, so you might want to write down everything I'm saying now, as a record
of our first meeting."
There was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the pair of them, and Harry sat,
torn between exasperation at Hermione and amusement at the look on Ron's face.
The silence was broken, not by Ron, who in any case looked as though he was
temporarily dumbstruck, but by a soft tap, tap on the window. Harry looked across
the now empty common room and saw, illuminated by the moonlight, a snowy
owl perched on the windowsill.
"Hedwig!" he shouted, and he launched himself out of his chair and across the
room to pull open the window.
Hedwig flew inside, soared across the room, and landed on the table on top of
Harry's predictions.
"About time!" said Harry, hurrying after her.
"She's got an answer!" said Ron excitedly, pointing at the grubby piece of
parchment tied to Hedwig's leg.
Harry hastily untied it and sat down to read, whereupon Hedwig fluttered onto his
146knee, hooting softly.
"What does it say?" Hermione asked breathlessly.
The letter was very short, and looked as though it had been scrawled in a great
hurry. Harry read it aloud:
Harry -
I'm flying north immediately. This news about your scar is the latest in a series of
strange rumors that have reached me here. If it hurts again, go straight to
Dumbledore - they're saying he's got Mad-Eye out of retirement, which means he's
reading the signs, even if no one else is.
I'll be in touch soon. My best to Ron and Hermione. Keep your eyes open, Harry.
Sirius
Harry looked up at Ron and Hermione, who stared back at him.
"He's flying north?" Hermione whispered. "He's coming back?"
"Dumbledore's reading what signs?" said Ron, looking perplexed. "Harry - what's
up?"
For Harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist, jolting Hedwig out of
his lap.
"I shouldn't've told him!" Harry said furiously.
"What are you on about?" said Ron in surprise.
"It's made him think he's got to come back!" said Harry, now slamming his fist on
the table so that Hedwig landed on the back of Ron's chair, hooting indignantly.
"Coming back, because he thinks I'm in trouble! And there's nothing wrong with
me! And I haven't got anything for you," Harry snapped at Hedwig, who was
clicking her beak expectantly, "you'll have to go up to the Owlery if you want
food."
Hedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took off for the open window,
cuffing him around the head with her outstretched wing as she went.
"Harry," Hermione began, in a pacifying sort of voice.
"I'm going to bed," said Harry shortly. "See you in the morning."
Upstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas and got into his four-poster, but
he didn't feel remotely tired.
If Sirius came back and got caught, it would be his, Harry's, fault. Why hadn't he
kept his mouth shut? A few seconds' pain and he'd had to blab. . . . If he'd just had
the sense to keep it to himself.
147He heard Ron come up into the dormitory a short while later, but did not speak to
him. For a long time, Harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed. The
dormitory was completely silent, and, had he been less preoccupied, Harry would
have realized that the absence of Neville's usual snores meant that he was not the
only one lying awake.
148CHAPTER FIFTEEN - BEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG
Early next morning, Harry woke with a plan fully formed in his mind, as though
his sleeping brain had been working on it all night. He got up, dressed in the pale
dawn light, left the dormitory without waking Ron, and went back down to the
deserted common room. Here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon
which his Divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter:
Dear Sirius,
I reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half asleep when I wrote to you last
time. There's no point coming back, everything's fine here. Don't worry about me,
my head feels completely normal.
Harry
He then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through the silent castle (held up only
briefly by Peeves, who tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along the
fourth-floor corridor), finally arriving at the Owlery, which was situated at the top
of West Tower.
The Owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold and drafty, because none of the
windows had glass in them. The floor was entirely covered in straw, owl
droppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles. Hundreds upon
hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose
right up to the top of the tower, nearly all of them asleep, though here and there a
round amber eye glared at Harry. He spotted Hedwig nestled between a barn owl
and a tawny, and hurried over to her, sliding a little on the dropping-strewn floor.
It took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him, as she kept
shuffling around on her perch, showing him her tail. She was evidently still
furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night. In the end, it was Harry
suggesting she might be too tired, and that perhaps he would ask Ron to borrow
Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it.
"Just find him, all right?" Harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on his
arm to one of the holes in the wall. "Before the dementors do."
She nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have done,
but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same. Then she spread her
wings and took off into the sunrise. Harry watched her fly out of sight with the
familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach. He had been so sure that Sirius's
reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them.
"That was a lie, Harry," said Hermione sharply over breakfast, when he told her
and Ron what he had done. "You didn't imagine your scar hurting and you know
149it."
"So what?" said Harry. "He's not going back to Azkaban because of me."
"Drop it," said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some
more, and for once, Hermione heeded him, and fell silent.
Harry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks. True,
he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the
post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went to sleep, prevent himself from
seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark London
street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather. He wished he
still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a
good, hard training session. On the other hand, their lessons were becoming more
difficult and demanding than ever before, particularly Moody's Defense Against
the Dark Arts.
To their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he would be putting the
Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to see
whether they could resist its effects.
"But - but you said it's illegal, Professor," said Hermione uncertainly as Moody
cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear space in the
middle of the room. "You said - to use it against another human was -"
"Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like," said Moody, his magical eye
swiveling onto Hermione and fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare. "If you'd
rather learn the hard way - when someone's putting it on you so they can control
you completely - fine by me. You're excused. Off you go."
He pointed one gnarled finger toward the door. Hermione went very pink and
muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave. Harry and Ron
grinned at each other. They knew Hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than
miss such an important lesson.
Moody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the Imperius Curse upon
them. Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most extraordinary
things under its influence. Dean Thomas hopped three times around the room,
singing the national anthem. Lavender Brown imitated a squirrel. Neville
performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have
been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them seemed to be able to fight off
the curse, and each of them recovered only when Moody had removed it.
"Potter," Moody growled, "you next."
Harry moved forward into the middle of the classroom, into the space that Moody
had cleared of desks. Moody raised his wand, pointed it at Harry, and said,
'1mperio!"
150It was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating sensation as every thought
and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague,
untraceable happiness. He stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly
aware of everyone watching him.
And then he heard Mad-Eye Moody's voice, echoing in some distant chamber of
his empty brain: Jump onto the desk. . . jump onto the desk. . .
Harry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring.
Jump onto the desk....
Why, though? Another voice had awoken in the back of his brain.
Stupid thing to do, really, said the voice.
Jump onto the desk....
No, I don't think I will, thanks, said the other voice, a little more firmly. . . no, I
don't really want to.
Jump! NOW!
The next thing Harry felt was considerable pain. He had both jumped and tried to
prevent himself from jumping - the result was that he'd smashed headlong into the
desk knocking it over, and, by the feeling in his legs, fractured both his kneecaps.
"Now, that's more like it!" growled Moody's voice, and suddenly, Harry felt the
empty, echoing feeling in his head disappear. He remembered exactly what was
happening, and the pain in his knees seemed to double.
"Look at that, you lot. . . Potter fought! He fought it, and he damn near beat it!
We'll try that again, Potter, and the rest of you, pay attention - watch his eyes,
that's where you see it - very good, Potter, very good indeed! They'll have trouble
controlling you!"
"The way he talks," Harry muttered as he hobbled out of the Defense Against the
Dark Arts class an hour later (Moody had insisted on putting Harry through his
paces four times in a row, until Harry could throw off the curse entirely), "you'd
think we were all going to be attacked any second."
"Yeah, I know," said Ron, who was skipping on every alternate step. He had had
much more difficulty with the curse than Harry, though Moody assured him the
effects would wear off by lunchtime. "Talk about paranoid. . ." Ron glanced
nervously over his shoulder to check that Moody was definitely out of earshot and
went on. "No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry. Did you
hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted 'Boo' behind him
on April Fools' Day? And when are we supposed to read up on resisting the
Imperius Curse with everything else we've got to do?"
151All the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they
were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall explained why, when the
class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration homework
she had assigned.
"You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!" she
told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles. "Your
Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer --"
"We don't take O.W.L.s till fifth year!" s aid Dean Thomas indignantly.
"Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can get!
Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a
hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion. I might remind you that your pincushion,
Thomas, still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin!"
Hermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to look too
pleased with herself.
Harry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney told them that they
had received top marks for their homework in their next Divination class. She read
out large portions of their predictions, commending them for their unflinching
acceptance of the horrors in store for them - but they were less amused when she
asked them to do the same thing for the month after next; both of them were
running out of ideas for catastrophes.
Meanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught History of Magic, had them
writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century. Professor
Snape was forcing them to research antidotes. They took this one seriously, as he
had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before Christmas to see if their
antidote worked. Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in
preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms.
Even Hagrid was adding to their workload. The Blast-Ended Skrewts were
growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate.
Hagrid was delighted, and as part of their "project," suggested that they come
down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on
their extraordinary behavior.
"I will not," said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had proposed this with the air
of Father Christmas pulling an extra-large toy out of his sack. "I see enough of
these foul things during lessons, thanks."
Hagrid's smile faded off his face.
"Yeh'll do wha' yer told," he growled, "or I'll be takin' a leaf outta Professor
Moody's book. . . . I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy."
The Gryffindors roared with laughter. Malfoy flushed with anger, but apparently
152the memory of Moody's punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from
retorting. Harry, Ron, and Hermione returned to the castle at the end of the lesson
in high spirits; seeing Hagrid put down Malfoy was particularly satisfying,
especially because Malfoy had done his very best to get Hagrid sacked the
previous year.
When they arrived in the entrance hall, they found themselves unable to proceed
owing to the large crowd of students congregated there, all milling around a large
sign that had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase. Ron, the tallest of the
three, stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them and read the sign aloud
to the other two:
TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT
THE DELEGATIONS FROM BEAUXBATONS AND
DURMSTRANG WILL BE ARRIVING AT 6 O'CLOCK
ON FRIDAY THE 30TH OF OCTOBER. LESSONS WILL
END HALF AN HOUR EARLY --
"Brilliant!" said Harry. "It's Potions last thing on Friday! Snape won't have time to
poison us all!"
STUDENTS WILL RETURN THEIR BAGS AND BOOKS
TO THEIR DORMITORIES AND ASSEMBLE IN FRONT
OF THE CASTLE TO GREET OUR GUESTS BEFORE
THE WELCOMING FEAST.
"Only a week away!" said Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff, emerging from the
crowd, his eyes gleaming. "I wonder if Cedric knows? Think I'll go and tell him. . .
."
"Cedric?" said Ron blankly as Ernie hurried off.
"Diggory," said Harry. "He must be entering the tournament."
"That idiot, Hogwarts champion?" said Ron as they pushed their way through the
chattering crowd toward the staircase.
"He's not an idiot. You just don't like him because he beat Gryffindor at
Quidditch," said Hermione. "I've heard he's a really good student - and he's a
prefect."
She spoke as though this settled the matter.
153"You only like him because he's handsome," said Ron scathingly.
"Excuse me, I don't like people just because they're handsome!" said Hermione
indignantly.
Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like "Lockhart!"
The appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon the
inhabitants of the castle. During the following week, there seemed to be only one
topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard Tournament.
Rumors were flying from student to student like highly contagious germs: who
was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what the tournament would involve, how
the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang differed from themselves.
Harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an extra-thorough
cleaning. Several grimy portraits had been scrubbed, much to the displeasure of
their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly and wincing as
they felt their raw pink faces. The suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and
moving without squeaking, and Argus Filch, the caretaker, was behaving so
ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair of
first-year girls into hysterics.
Other members of the staff seemed oddly tense too.
"Longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can't even perform a simple Switching
Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang!" Professor McGonagall barked at the
end of one particularly difficult lesson, during which Neville had accidentally
transplanted his own ears onto a cactus.
When they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of October, they
found that the Great Hall had been decorated overnight. Enormous silk banners
hung from the walls, each of them representing a Hogwarts House: red with a gold
lion for Gryffiindor, blue with a bronze eagle for Ravenclaw, yellow with a black
badger for Hufflepuff, and green with a silver serpent for Slytherin. Behind the
teachers' table, the largest banner of all bore the Hogwarts coat of arms: lion,
eagle, badger, and snake united around a large letter H.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down beside Fred and George at the Gryffindor
table. Once again, and most unusually, they were sitting apart from everyone else
and conversing in low voices. Ron led the way over to them.
"It's a bummer, all right," George was saying gloomily to Fred. "But if he won't
talk to us in person, we'll have to send him the letter after all. Or we'll stuff it into
his hand. He can't avoid us forrever.
"Who's avoiding you?" said Ron, sitting down next to them.
"Wish you would," said Fred, looking irritated at the interruption.
"What's a bummer?" Ron asked George.
154"Having a nosy git like you for a brother," said George.
"You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet?" Harry asked. "Thought
any more about trying to enter?"
"I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she wasn't telling," said
George bitterly. "She just told me to shut up and get on with transfiguring my
raccoon."
"Wonder what the tasks are going to be?" said Ron thoughtfully. "You know, I bet
we could do them, Harry. We've done dangerous stuff before. . . ."
"Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven't," said Fred. "McGonagall says the
champions get awarded points according to how well they've done the tasks."
"Who are the judges?" Harry asked.
"Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel," said
Hermione, and everyone looked around at her, rather surprised, "because all three
of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice the
champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage."
She noticed them all looking at her and said, with her usual air of impatience that
nobody else had read all the books she had, "It's all in Hogwarts, A History.
Though, of course, that book's not entirely reliable. A Revised History of
Hogwarts would be a more accurate title. Or A Highly Biased and Selective
History of Hogwarts, Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School."
"What are you on about?" said Ron, though Harry thought he knew what was
coming.
"House-elves!" said Hermione, her eyes flashing. "Not once, in over a thousand
pages, does Hogwarts, A History mention that we are all colluding in the
oppression of a hundred slaves!"
Harry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs. His and Ron's
lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb Hermione's determination
to pursue justice for house-elves.
True, both of them had paid two Sickles for a S.P.E.W. badge, but they had only
done it to keep her quiet. Their Sickles had been wasted, however; if anything,
they seemed to have made Hermione more vociferous. She had been badgering
Harry and Ron ever since, first to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do
the same, and she had also taken to rattling around the Gryffindor common room
every evening, cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses.
"You do realize that your sheets are changed, your fires lit, your classrooms
cleaned, and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid
and enslaved?" she kept saying fiercely.
155Some people, like Neville, had paid up just to stop Hermione from glowering at
them. A few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say, but were reluctant to
take a more active role in campaigning. Many regarded the whole thing as a joke.
Ron now rolled his eyes at the ceiling, which was flooding them all in autumn
sunlight, and Fred became extremely interested in his bacon (both twins had
refused to buy a S.P.E.W. badge). George, however, leaned in toward Hermione.
"Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens, Hermione?"
"No, of course not," said Hermione curtly, "I hardly think students are supposed to
-"
"Well, we have," said George, indicating Fred, "loads of times, to nick food. And
we've met them, and they're happy. They think they've got the best job in the
world -"
"That's because they're uneducated and brainwashed!" Hermione began hotly, but
her next few words were drowned out by the sudden whooshing noise from
overhead, which announced the arrival of the post owls. Harry looked up at once,
and saw Hedwig soaring toward him. Hermione stopped talking abruptly; she and
Ron watched Hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto Harry's shoulder,
folded her wings, and held out her leg wearily.
Harry pulled off Sirius's reply and offered Hedwig his bacon rinds, which she ate
gratefully. Then, checking that Fred and George were safely immersed in further
discussions about the Triwizard Tournament, Harry read out Sirius's letter in a
whisper to Ron and Hermione.
Nice try, Harry.
I'm back in the country and well hidden. I want you to keep me posted on
everything that's going on at Hogwarts. Don't use Hedwig, keep changing owls,
and don't worry about me, just watch out for yourself Don't forget what I said
about your scar.
Sirius
"Why d'you have to keep changing owls?" Ron asked in a low voice.
"Hedwig'll attract too much attention," said Hermione at once. "She stands out. A
snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he's hiding. . . I mean, they're not
native birds, are they?"
Harry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes, wondering whether he felt
more or less worried than before. He supposed that Sirius managing to get back
without being caught was something. He couldn't deny either that the idea that
Sirius was much nearer was reassuring; at least he wouldn't have to wait so long
for a response every time he wrote.
156"Thanks, Hedwig," he said, stroking her. She hooted sleepily, dipped her beak
briefly into his goblet of orange juice, then took off again, clearly desperate for a
good long sleep in the Owlery.
There was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day. Nobody was very
attentive in lessons, being much more interested in the arrival that evening of the
people from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang; even Potions was more bearable than
usual, as it was half an hour shorter. When the bell rang early, Harry, Ron, and
Hermione hurried up to Gryffindor Tower, deposited their bags and books as they
had been instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and rushed back downstairs into the
entrance hall.
The Heads of Houses were ordering their students into lines.
"Weasley, straighten your hat," Professor McGonagall snapped at Ron. "Miss
Patil, take that ridiculous thing out of your hair."
Parvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from the end of her
plait.
"Follow me, please," said Professor McGonagall. "First years in front. . . no
pushing.. .
They filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle. It was a cold, clear
evening; dusk was falling and a pale, transparent-looking moon was already
shining over the Forbidden Forest. Harry, standing between Ron and Hermione in
the fourth row from the front, saw Dennis Creevey positively shivering with
anticipation among the other first years.
"Nearly six," said Ron, checking his watch and then staring down the drive that
led to the front gates. "How d'you reckon they're coming? The train?"
"I doubt it," said Hermione.
"How, then? Broomsticks?" Harry suggested, looking up at the starry sky.
"I don't think so. . . not from that far away.. .
"A Portkey?" Ron suggested. "Or they could Apparate - maybe you're allowed to
do it under seventeen wherever they come from?"
"You can't Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds, how often do I have to tell
you?" said Hermione impatiently.
They scanned the darkening grounds excitedly, but nothing was moving;
everything was still, silent, and quite as usual. Harry was starting to feel cold. He
wished they'd hurry up. .. . Maybe the foreign students were preparing a dramatic
entrance. . . . He remembered what Mr. Weasley had said back at the campsite
before the Quidditch World Cup: "always the same - we can't resist showing off
when we get together. .."
157And then Dumbledore called out from the back row where he stood with the other
teachers - "Aha! Unless I am very much mistaken, the delegation from
Beauxbatons approaches!"
"Where?" said many students eagerly, all looking in different directions.
"There!" yelled a sixth year, pointing over the forest.
Something large, much larger than a broomstick - or, indeed, a hundred
broomsticks - was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle, growing
larger all the time.
"It's a dragon!" shrieked one of the first years, losing her head completely.
"Don't be stupid. . . it's a flying house!" said Dennis Creevey.
Dennis's guess was closer. . . . As the gigantic black shape skimmed over the
treetops of the Forbidden Forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit
it, they saw a gigantic, powderblue, horse-drawn carriage, the size of a large
house, soaring toward them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all
palominos, and each the size of an elephant.
The front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever lower,
coming in to land at a tremendous speed - then, with an almighty crash that made
Neville jump backward onto a Slytherin fifth year's foot, the horses' hooves, larger
than dinner plates, hit the ground. A second later, the carriage landed too,
bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the golden horses tossed their enormous
heads and rolled large, fiery red eyes.
Harry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms (two
crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars) before it opened.
A boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage, bent forward, fumbled
for a moment with something on the carriage floor, and unfolded a set of golden
steps. He sprang back respectfully. Then Harry saw a shining, high-heeled black
shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage - a shoe the size of a child's sled -
followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life.
The size of the carriage, and of the horses, was immediately explained. A few
people gasped.
Harry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life, and that
was Hagrid; he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights. Yet
somehow - maybe simply because he was used to Hagrid - this woman (now at the
foot of the steps, and looking around at the waiting, wide-eyed crowd) seemed
even more unnaturally large. As she stepped into the light flooding from the
entrance hall, she was revealed to have a handsome, olive-skinned face; large,
black, liquid-looking eyes; and a rather beaky nose. Her hair was drawn back in a
shining knob at the base of her neck. She was dressed from head to foot in black
satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers.
158Dumbledore started to clap; the students, following his lead, broke into applause
too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman.
Her face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward
Dumbledore, extending a glittering hand. Dumbledore, though tall himself, had
barely to bend to kiss it.
"My dear Madame Maxime," he said. "Welcome to Hogwarts."
"Dumbly-dort," said Madame Maxime in a deep voice. "I 'ope I find you well?"
"In excellent form, I thank you," said Dumbledore.
"My pupils," said Madame Maxime, waving one of her enormous hands carelessly
behind her.
Harry, whose attention had been focused completely upon Madame Maxime, now
noticed that about a dozen boys and girls, all, by the look of them, in their late
teens, had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind Madame
Maxime. They were shivering, which was unsurprising, given that their robes
seemed to be made of fine silk, and none of them were wearing cloaks. A few had
wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads. From what Harry could see of
them (they were standing in Madame Maxime's enormous shadow), they were
staring up at Hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces.
"As Karkaroff arrived yet?" Madame Maxime asked.
"He should be here any moment," said Dumbledore. "Would you like to wait here
and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle?"
"Warm up, I think," said Madame Maxime. "But ze 'orses -"
"Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them,"
said Dumbledore, "the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation
that has arisen with some of his other - er - charges."
"Skrewts," Ron muttered to Harry, grinning.
"My steeds require - er - forceful 'andling," said Madame Maxime, looking as
though she doubted whether any Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts
could be up to the job. "Zey are very strong. . . ."
"I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job," said Dumbledore, smiling.
"Very well," said Madame Maxime, bowing slightly. "Will you please inform zis
'Agrid zat ze 'orses drink only single-malt whiskey?"
"It will be attended to," said Dumbledore, also bowing.
"Come," said Madame Maxime imperiously to her students, and the Hogwarts
crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps.
159"How big d'you reckon Durmstrang's horses are going to be?" Seamus Finnigan
said, leaning around Lavender and Parvati to address Harry and Ron.
"Well, if they're any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid won't be able to handle
them," said Harry. "That's if he hasn't been attacked by his skrewts. Wonder what's
up with them?"
"Maybe they've escaped," said Ron hopefully.
"Oh don't say that," said Hermione with a shudder. "Imagine that lot loose on the
grounds. . . ."
They stood, shivering slightly now, waiting for the Durmstrang party to arrive.
Most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky.
For a few minutes, the silence was broken only by Madame Maxime's huge horses
snorting and stamping. But then - "Can you hear something?" said Ron suddenly.
Harry listened; a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from out of
the darkness: a muffled rumbling and sucking sound, as though an immense
vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed.
"The lake!" yelled Lee Jordan, pointing down at it. "Look at the lake!"
From their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds, they had a
clear view of the smooth black surface of the water - except that the surface was
suddenly not smooth at all. Some disturbance was taking place deep in the center;
great bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now washing over the
muddy banks - and then, out in the very middle of the lake, a whirlpool appeared,
as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake's floor. .
What seemed to be a long, black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the
whirlpool. . . and then Harry saw the rigging....
"It's a mast!" he said to Ron and Hermione.
Slowly, magnificently, the ship rose out of the water, gleaming in the moonlight. It
had a strangely skeletal look about it, as though it were a resurrected wreck, and
the dim, misty lights shimmering at its portholes looked like ghostly eyes. Finally,
with a great sloshing noise, the ship emerged entirely, bobbing on the turbulent
water, and began to glide toward the bank. A few moments later, they heard the
splash of an anchor being thrown down in the shallows, and the thud of a plank
being lowered onto the bank.
People were disembarking; they could see their silhouettes passing the lights in the
ship's portholes. All of them, Harry noticed, seemed to be built along the lines of
Crabbe and Goyle... but then, as they drew nearer, walking up the lawns into the
light streaming from the entrance hall, he saw that their bulk was really due to the
fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy, matted fur. But the
man who was leading them up to the castle was wearing furs of a different sort:
160sleek and silver, like his hair.
"Dumbledore!" he called heartily as he walked up the slope. "How are you, my
dear fellow, how are you?"
"Blooming, thank you, Professor Karkaroff," Dumbledore replied. Karkaroff had a
fruity, unctuous voice; when he stepped into the light pouring from the front doors
of the castle they saw that he was tall and thin like Dumbledore, but his white hair
was short, and his goatee (finishing in a small curl) did not entirely hide his rather
weak chin. When he reached Dumbledore, he shook hands with both of his own.
"Dear old Hogwarts," he said, looking up at the castle and smiling; his teeth were
rather yellow, and Harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes, which
remained cold and shrewd. "How good it is to be here, how good.. . . Viktor, come
along, into the warmth. . . you don't mind, Dumbledore? Viktor has a slight head
cold..."
Karkaroff beckoned forward one of his students. As the boy passed, Harry caught
a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He didn't need
the punch on the arm Ron gave him, or the hiss in his ear, to recognize that profile.
"Harry - it's Krum!"
161CHAPTER SIXTEEN - THE GOBLET OF FIRE
I don't believe it!" Ron said, in a stunned voice, as the Hogwarts students filed
back up the steps behind the party from Durmstrang. "Krum, Harry! Viktor
Krum!"
"For heaven's sake, Ron, he's only a Quidditch player," said Hermione.
"Only a Quidditch player?" Ron said, looking at her as though he couldn't believe
his ears. "Hermione - he's one of the best Seekers in the world! I had no idea he
was still at school!"
As they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the Hogwarts students heading
for the Great Hall, Harry saw Lee Jordan jumping up and down on the soles of his
feet to get a better look at the back of Krum's head. Several sixth-year girls were
frantically searching their pockets as they walked - "Oh I don't believe it, I haven't
got a single quill on me -"
"D'you think he'd sign my hat in lipstick?"
"Really," Hermione said loftily as they passed the girls, now squabbling over the
lipstick.
"I'm getting his autograph if I can," said Ron. "You haven't got a quill, have you,
Harry?"
"Nope, they're upstairs in my bag," said Harry.
They walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat down. Ron took care to sit on the
side facing the doorway, because Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students were
still gathered around it, apparently unsure about where they should sit. The
students from Beauxbatons had chosen seats at the Ravenclaw table. They were
looking around the Great Hall with glum expressions on their faces. Three of them
were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads.
"It's not that cold," said Hermione defensively. "Why didn't they bring cloaks?"
"Over here! Come and sit over here!" Ron hissed. "Over here! Hermione, budge
up, make a space -"
"What?"
"Too late," said Ron bitterly.
Viktor Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students had settled themselves at the
Slytherin table. Harry could see Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle looking very smug
about this. As he watched, Malfoy bent forward to speak to Krum.
162"Yeah, that's right, smarm up to him, Malfoy," said Ron scathingly. "I bet Krum
can see right through him, though. . . bet he gets people fawning over him all the
time.. . . Where d'you reckon they're going to sleep? We could offer him a space in
our dormitory, Harry. . . I wouldn't mind giving him my bed, I could kip on a
camp bed."
Hermione snorted.
"They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot," said Harry. The Durmstrang
students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling
with expressions of interest; a couple of them were picking up the golden plates
and goblets and examining them, apparently impressed.
Up at the staff table, Filch, the caretaker, was adding chairs. He was wearing his
moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion. Harry was surprised to see that he
added four chairs, two on either side of Dumbledore's.
"But there are only two extra people," Harry said. "Why's Filch putting out four
chairs, who else is coming?"
"Eh?" said Ron vaguely. He was still staring avidly at Krum.
When all the students had entered the Hall and settled down at their House tables,
the staff entered, filing up to the top table and taking their seats. Last in line were
Professor Dumbledore, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime. When their
headmistress appeared, the pupils from Beauxbatons leapt to their feet. A few of
the Hogwarts students laughed. The Beauxbatons party appeared quite
unembarrassed, however, and did not resume their seats until Madame Maxime
had sat down on Dumbledore's left-hand side. Dumbledore remained standing, and
a silence fell over the Great Hall.
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and - most particularly - guests," said
Dumbledore, beaming around at the foreign students. "I have great pleasure in
welcoming you all to Hogwarts. I hope and trust that your stay here will be both
comfortable and enjoyable."
One of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what
was unmistakably a derisive laugh.
"No one's making you stay!" Hermione whispered, bristling at her.
"The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast," said
Dumbledore. "I now invite you all to eat, drink, and make yourselves at home!"
He sat down, and Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in
conversation.
The plates in front of them filled with food as usual. The house-elves in the
kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops; there was a greater variety of
dishes in front of them than Harry had ever seen, including several that were
163definitely foreign.
"What's that?" said Ron, pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that
stood beside a large steak-and-kidney pudding.
"Bouillabaisse," said Hermione.
"Bless you," said Ron.
"It's French," said Hermione, "I had it on holiday summer before last. It's very
nice."
"I'll take your word for it," said Ron, helping himself to black pudding.
The Great Hall seemed somehow much more crowded than usual, even though
there were barely twenty additional students there; perhaps it was because their
differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly against the black of the Hogwarts'
robes. Now that they had removed their furs, the Durmstrang students were
revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodred.
Hagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the staff table twenty minutes
after the start of the feast. He slid into his seat at the end and waved at Harry, Ron,
and Hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand.
"Skrewts doing all right, Hagrid?" Harry called.
"Thrivin'," Hagrid called back happily.
"Yeah, I'll just bet they are," said Ron quietly. "Looks like they've finally found a
food they like, doesn't it? Hagrid's fingers."
At that moment, a voice said, "Excuse me, are you wanting ze bouillabaisse?"
It was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore's speech.
She had finally removed her muffler. A long sheet of silvery-blonde hair fell
almost to her waist. She had large, deep blue eyes, and very white, even teeth.
Ron went purple. He stared up at her, opened his mouth to reply, but nothing came
out except a faint gurgling noise.
"Yeah, have it," said Harry, pushing the dish toward the girl.
"You 'ave finished wiz it?"
"Yeah," Ron said breathlessly. "Yeah, it was excellent."
The girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the Ravenclaw table. Ron
was still goggling at the girl as though he had never seen one before. Harry started
to laugh. The sound seemed to jog Ron back to his senses.
"She's a veela!" he said hoarsely to Harry.
164"Of course she isn't!" said Hermione tartly. "I don't see anyone else gaping at her
like an idiot!"
But she wasn't entirely right about that. As the girl crossed the Hall, many boys'
heads turned, and some of them seemed to have become temporarily speechless,
just like Ron.
"I'm telling you, that's not a normal girl!" said Ron, leaning sideways so he could
keep a clear view of her. "They don't make them like that at Hogwarts!"
"They make them okay at Hogwarts," said Harry without thinking. Cho happened
to be sitting only a few places away from the girl with the silvery hair.
"When you've both put your eyes back in," said Hermione briskly, "you'll be able
to see who's just arrived."
She was pointing up at the staff table. The two remaining empty seats had just
been filled. Ludo Bagman was now sitting on Professor Karkaroff's other side,
while Mr. Crouch, Percy's boss, was next to Madame Maxime.
"What are they doing here?" said Harry in surprise.
"They organized the Triwizard Tournament, didn't they?" said Hermione. "I
suppose they wanted to be here to see it start."
When the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts too.
Ron examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely, then moved it carefully a
few inches to his right, so that it would be clearly visible from the Ravenclaw
table. The girl who looked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough, however,
and did not come over to get it.
Once the golden plates had been wiped clean, Dumbledore stood up again. A
pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the Hall now. Harry felt a slight thrill of
excitement, wondering what was coming. Several seats down from them, Fred and
George were leaning forward, staring at Dumbledore with great concentration.
"The moment has come," said Dumbledore, smiling around at the sea of upturned
faces. "The Triwizard Tournament is about to start. I would like to say a few
words of explanation before we bring in the casket --"
"The what?" Harry muttered.
Ron shrugged.
"- just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year. But first, let me
introduce, for those who do not know them, Mr. Bartemius Crouch, Head of the
Department of International Magical Cooperation" - there was a smattering of
polite applause - "and Mr. Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical
Games and Sports."
165There was a much louder round of applause for Bagman than for Crouch, perhaps
because of his fame as a Beater, or simply because he looked so much more
likable. He acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand. Bartemius Crouch did
not smile or wave when his name was announced. Remembering him in his neat
suit at the Quidditch World Cup, Harry thought he looked strange in wizard's
robes. His toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to
Dumbledore's long white hair and beard.
"Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on
the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament," Dumbledore continued, "and
they will be joining myself, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime on the
panel that will judge the champions' efforts."
At the mention of the word "champions," the attentiveness of the listening students
seemed to sharpen. Perhaps Dumbledore had noticed their sudden stillness, for he
smiled as he said, "The casket, then, if you please, Mr. Filch."
Filch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the Hall, now approached
Dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels. It looked
extremely old. A murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students;
Dennis Creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly, but, being so tiny,
his head hardly rose above anyone else's.
"The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been
examined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman," said Dumbledore as Filch placed the
chest carefully on the table before him, "and they have made the necessary
arrangements for each challenge. There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the
school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways.. their
magical prowess - their daring - their powers of deduction - and, of course, their
ability to cope with danger."
At this last word, the Hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed
to be breathing.
"As you know, three champions compete in the tournament," Dumbledore went on
calmly, "one from each of the participating schools. They will be marked on how
well they perform each of the Tournament tasks and the champion with the highest
total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup. The champions will be chosen by
an impartial selector: the Goblet of Fire."
Dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the
casket. The lid creaked slowly open. Dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out
a large, roughly hewn wooden cup. It would have been entirely unremarkable had
it not been full to the brim with dancing blue-white flames.
Dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it, where it
would be clearly visible to everyone in the Hall.
"Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and
166school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet," said
Dumbledore. "Aspiring champions have twenty-four hours in which to put their
names forward. Tomorrow night, Halloween, the goblet will return the names of
the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools. The goblet will be
placed in the entrance hall tonight, where it will be freely accessible to all those
wishing to compete.
"To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation," said Dumbledore, "I
will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in
the entrance hall. Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line.
"Finally, I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this
tournament is not to be entered into lightly. Once a champion has been selected by
the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end.
The placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract.
There can be no change of heart once you have become a champion. Please be
very sure, therefore, that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop
your name into the goblet. Now, I think it is time for bed. Good night to you all."
"An Age Line!" Fred Weasley said, his eyes glinting, as they all made their way
across the Hall to the doors into the entrance hall. "Well, that should be fooled by
an Aging Potion, shouldn't it? And once your name's in that goblet, you're
laughing - it can't tell whether you're seventeen or not!"
"But I don't think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance," said Hermione,
"we just haven't learned enough. . ."
"Speak for yourself," said George shortly. "You'll try and get in, won't you,
Harry?"
Harry thought briefly of Dumbledore's insistence that nobody under seventeen
should submit their name, but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the
Triwizard Tournament filled his mind again. .. . He wondered how angry
Dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get
over the Age Line.
"Where is he?" said Ron, who wasn't listening to a word of this conversation, but
looking through the crowd to see what had become of Krum. "Dumbledore didn't
say where the Durmstrang people are sleeping, did he?"
But this query was answered almost instantly; they were level with the Slytherin
table now, and Karkaroff had just bustled up to his students.
"Back to the ship, then," he was saying. "Viktor, how are you feeling? Did you eat
enough? Should I send for some mulled wine from the kitchens?"
Harry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on. "Professor, Ivood
like some vine," said one of the other Durmstrang boys hopefully.
167"I wasn't offering it to you, Poliakoff," snapped Karkaroff, his warmly paternal air
vanishing in an instant. "I notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your
robes again, disgusting boy -"
Karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors, reaching them at exactly
the same moment as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Harry stopped to let him walk
through first.
"Thank you," said Karkaroff carelessly, glancing at him. And then Karkaroff
froze. He turned his head back to Harry and stared at him as though he couldn't
believe his eyes. Behind their headmaster, the students from Durmstrang came to a
halt too. Karkaroff's eyes moved slowly up Harry's face and fixed upon his scar.
The Durmstrang students were staring curiously at Harry too. Out of the corner of
his eye, Harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces. The boy with
food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and pointed openly at Harry's
forehead.
"Yeah, that's Harry Potter," said a growling voice from behind them.
Professor Karkaroff spun around. Mad-Eye Moody was standing there, leaning
heavily on his staff, his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the Durmstrang
headmaster.
The color drained from Karkaroff's face as Harry watched. A terrible look of
mingled fury and fear came over him.
"You!" he said, staring at Moody as though unsure he was really seeing him.
"Me," said Moody grimly. "And unless you've got anything to say to Potter,
Karkaroff, you might want to move. You're blocking the doorway."
It was true; half the students in the Hall were now waiting behind them, looking
over one another's shoulders to see what was causing the holdup.
Without another word, Professor Karkaroff swept his students away with him.
Moody watched him until he was out of sight, his magical eye fixed upon his
back, a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face.
As the next day was Saturday, most students would normally have breakfasted
late. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were not alone in rising much earlier
than they usually did on weekends. When they went down into the entrance hall,
they saw about twenty people milling around it, some of them eating toast, all
examining the Goblet of Fire. It had been placed in the center of the hall on the
stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat. A thin golden line had been traced on the
floor, forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction.
"Anyone put their name in yet?" Ron asked a third-year girl eagerly.
"All the Durmstrang lot," she replied. "But I haven't seen anyone from Hogwarts
yet."
168"Bet some of them put it in last night after we'd all gone to bed," said Harry. "I
would've if it had been me. . . wouldn't have wanted everyone watching. What if
the goblet just gobbed you right back out again?"
Someone laughed behind Harry. Turning, he saw Fred, George, and Lee Jordan
hurrying down the staircase, all three of them looking extremely excited.
"Done it," Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. "Just
taken it."
"What?" said Ron.
"The Aging Potion, dung brains," said Fred.
"One drop each," said George, rubbing his hands together with glee. "We only
need to be a few months older."
"We're going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one of us
wins," said Lee, grinning broadly.
"I'm not sure this is going to work, you know," said Hermione warningly. "I'm
sure Dumbledore will have thought of this."
Fred, George, and Lee ignored her.
"Ready?" Fred said to the other two, quivering with excitement. "C'mon, then - I'll
go first -"
Harry watched, fascinated, as Fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket
bearing the words Fred Weasley - Hogwarts. Fred walked right up to the edge of
the line and stood there, rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fifty-foot
drop. Then, with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him, he took a
great breath and stepped over the line.
For a split second Harry thought it had worked - George certainly thought so, for
he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after Fred - but next moment, there was a
loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though
they had been thrown by an invisible shot-putter. They landed painfully, ten feet
away on the cold stone floor, and to add insult to injury, there was a loud popping
noise, and both of them sprouted identical long white beards.
The entrance hall rang with laughter. Even Fred and George joined in, once they
had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each other's beards.
"I did warn you," said a deep, amused voice, and everyone turned to see Professor
Dumbledore coming out of the Great Hall. He surveyed Fred and George, his eyes
twinkling. "I suggest you both go up to Madam Pomfrey. She is already tending to
Miss Fawcett, of Ravenclaw, and Mr. Summers, of Hufflepuff, both of whom
decided to age themselves up a little too. Though I must say, neither of their
beards is anything like as fine as yours."
169Fred and George set off for the hospital wing, accompanied by Lee, who was
howling with laughter, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione, also chortling, went in to
breakfast.
The decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning. As it was Halloween,
a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling, while hundreds of
carved pumpkins leered from every corner. Harry led the way over to Dean and
Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who
might be entering.
"There's a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in,"
Dean told Harry. "That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth."
Harry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head in disgust.
"We can't have a Slytherin champion!"
"And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory," said Seamus contemptuously.
"But I wouldn't have thought he'd have wanted to risk his good looks."
"Listen!" said Hermione suddenly.
People were cheering out in the entrance hall. They all swiveled around in their
seats and saw Angelina Johnson coming into the Hall, grinning in an embarrassed
sort of way. A tall black girl who played Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team,
Angelina came over to them, sat down, and said, "Well, I've done it! Just put my
name in!"
"You're kidding!" said Ron, looking impressed.
"Are you seventeen, then?" asked Harry.
"Course she is, can't see a beard, can you?" said Ron.
"I had my birthday last week," said Angelina.
"Well, I'm glad someone from Gryffindor's entering," said Hermione. "I really
hope you get it, Angelina!"
"Thanks, Hermione," said Angelina, smiling at her.
Yeah, better you than Pretty-Boy Diggory, said Seamus, causing several
Hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him.
"What're we going to do today, then?" Ron asked Harry and Hermione when they
had finished breakfast and were leaving the Great Hall.
"We haven't been down to visit Hagrid yet," said Harry.
"Okay," said Ron, "just as long as he doesn't ask us to donate a few fingers to the
skrewts."
170A look of great excitement suddenly dawned on Hermione's face.
"I've just realized - I haven't asked Hagrid to join S.P.E.W. yet!" she said brightly.
"Wait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?"
"What is it with her?" said Ron, exasperated, as Hermione ran away up the marble
staircase.
"Hey, Ron," said Harry suddenly. "It's your friend. . ."
The students from Beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the
grounds, among them, the veela-girl. Those gathered around the Goblet of Fire
stood back to let them pass, watching eagerly.
Madame Maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a
line. One by one, the Beauxbatons students stepped across the Age Line and
dropped their slips of parchment into the blue-white flames. As each name entered
the fire, it turned briefly red and emitted sparks.
"What d'you reckon'll happen to the ones who aren't chosen?" Ron muttered to
Harry as the veela-girl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire. "Reckon
they'll go back to school, or hang around to watch the tournament?"
"Dunno," said Harry. "Hang around, I suppose... . Madame Maxime's staying to
judge, isn't she?"
When all the Beauxbatons students had submitted their names, Madame Maxime
led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again.
"Where are they sleeping, then?" said Ron, moving toward the front doors and
staring after them.
A loud rattling noise behind them announced Hermione's reappearance with the
box of S. P. E.W. badges.
"Oh good, hurry up," said Ron, and he jumped down the stone steps, keeping his
eyes on the back of the veela-girl, who was now halfway across the lawn with
Madame Maxime.
As they neared Hagrid's cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, the mystery of
the Beauxbatons' sleeping quarters was solved. The gigantic powder-blue carriage
in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from Hagrid's front
door, and the students were climbing back inside it. The elephantine flying horses
that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it.
Harry knocked on Hagrid's door, and Fang's booming barks answered instantly.
"Bout time!" said Hagrid, when he'd flung open the door. "Thought you lot'd
forgotten where I live!"
"We've been really busy, Hag -" Hermione started to say, but then she stopped
171dead, looking up at Hagrid, apparently lost for words.
Hagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy brown suit, plus a checked
yellow-and-orange tie. This wasn't the worst of it, though; he had evidently tried to
tame his hair, using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease. It was now
slicked down into two bunches - perhaps he had tried a ponytail like Bill's, but
found he had too much hair. The look didn't really suit Hagrid at all. For a
moment, Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, she
said, "Erm - where are the skrewts."
"Out by the pumpkin patch," said Hagrid happily. "They're get-tin' massive, mus'
be nearly three foot long now. On'y trouble is, they've started killin' each other."
"Oh no, really?" said Hermione, shooting a repressive look at Ron, who, staring at
Hagrid's odd hairstyle, had just opened his mouth to say something about it.
"Yeah," said Hagrid sadly. "S' okay, though, I've got 'em in separate boxes now.
Still got abou' twenty."
"Well, that's lucky," said Ron. Hagrid missed the sarcasm.
Hagrid's cabin comprised a single room, in one corner of which was a gigantic bed
covered in a patchwork quilt. A similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood
in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from
the ceiling. They sat down at the table while Hagrid started to make tea, and were
soon immersed in yet more discussion of the Triwizard Tournament. Hagrid
seemed quite as excited about it as they were.
"You wait," he said, grinning. "You jus' wait. Yer going ter see some stuff yeh've
never seen before. Firs' task. . . ah, but I'm not supposed ter say."
"Go on, Hagrid!" Harry, Ron, and Hermione urged him, but he just shook his
head, grinning.
"I don' want ter spoil it fer yeh," said Hagrid. "But it's gonna be spectacular, I'll tell
yeh that. Them champions're going ter have their work cut out. Never thought I'd
live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again!"
They ended up having lunch with Hagrid, though they didn't eat much - Hagrid
had made what he said was a beef casserole, but after Hermione unearthed a large
talon in hers, she, Harry, and Ron rather lost their appetites. However, they
enjoyed themselves trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the
tournament were going to be, speculating which of the entrants were likely to be
selected as champions, and wondering whether Fred and George were beardless
yet.
A light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was very cozy sitting by the fire,
listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window, watching Hagrid darning
his socks and arguing with Hermione about house-elves - for he flatly refused to
172join S.P.E.W. when she showed him her badges.
"It'd be doin' 'em an unkindness, Hermione," he said gravely, threading a massive
bone needle with thick yellow yarn. "It's in their nature ter look after humans,
that's what they like, see? Yeh'd be makin' 'em unhappy ter take away their work,
an' insutin' 'em if yeh tried ter pay 'em."
"But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon about it!" said Hermione.
"And we heard he's asking for wages now!"
"Yeah, well, yeh get weirdos in every breed. I'm not sayin' there isn't the odd elf
who'd take freedom, but yeh'll never persuade most of 'em ter do it - no, nothin'
doin', Hermione."
Hermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her
cloak pocket.
By half past five it was growing dark, and Ron, Harry, and Hermione decided it
was time to get back up to the castle for the Halloween feast - and, more
important, the announcement of the school champions.
"I'll come with yeh," said Hagrid, putting away his darning. "Jus' give us a sec."
Hagrid got up, went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed, and began
searching for something inside it. They didn't pay too much attention until a truly
horrible smell reached their nostrils. Coughing, Ron said, "Hagrid, what's that?"
"Eh?" said Hagrid, turning around with a large bottle in his hand. "Don' yeh like
it?"
"Is that aftershave?" said Hermione in a slightly choked voice.
"Er - eau de cologne," Hagrid muttered. He was blushing.
"Maybe it's a bit much," he said gruffly. "I'll go take it off, hang on..."
He stumped out of the cabin, and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the
water barrel outside the window.
"Eau de cologne?" said Hermione in amazement. "Hagrid?"
"And what's with the hair and the suit?" said Harry in an undertone.
"Look!" said Ron suddenly, pointing out of the window. Hagrid had just
straightened up and turned 'round. If he had been blushing before, it was nothing
to what he was doing now. Getting to their feet very cautiously, so that Hagrid
wouldn't spot them, Harry, Ron, and Hermione peered through the window and
saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just emerged from
their carriage, clearly about to set off for the feast too. They couldn't hear what
Hagrid was saying, but he was talking to Madame Maxime with a rapt, misty-eyed
expression Harry had only ever seen him wear once before - when he had been
173looking at the baby dragon, Norbert.
"He's going up to the castle with her!" said Hermione indignantly. "I thought he
was waiting for us!"
Without so much as a backward glance at his cabin, Hagrid was trudging off up
the grounds with Madame Maxime, the Beaux-batons students following in their
wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.
"He fancies her!" said Ron incredulously. "Well, if they end up having children,
they'll be setting a world record - bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton."
They let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them. It was
surprisingly dark outside. Drawing their cloaks more closely around themselves,
they set off up the sloping lawns.
"Ooh it's them, look!" Hermione whispered.
The Durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake. Viktor
Krum was walking side by side with Karkaroff, and the other Durmstrang students
were straggling along behind them. Ron watched Krum excitedly, but Krum did
not look around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of Hermione, Ron, and
Harry and proceeded through them.
When they entered the candlelit Great Hall it was almost full. The Goblet of Fire
had been moved; it was now standing in front of Dumbledore's empty chair at the
teachers' table. Fred and George - clean-shaven again - seemed to have taken their
disappointment fairly well.
"Hope it's Angelina," said Fred as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down.
"So do I!" said Hermione breathlessly. "Well, we'll soon know!"
The Halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual. Perhaps because it
was their second feast in two days, Harry didn't seem to fancy the extravagantly
prepared food as much as he would have normally. Like everyone else in the Hall,
judging by the constantly craning necks, the impatient expressions on every face,
the fidgeting, and the standing up to see whether Dumbledore had finished eating
yet, Harry simply wanted the plates to clear, and to hear who had been selected as
champions.
At long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless state; there was a
sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall, which died away almost
instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet. On either side of him, Professor Karkaroff
and Madame Maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone. Ludo Bagman was
beaming and winking at various students. Mr. Crouch, however, looked quite
uninterested, almost bored.
"Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision," said Dumbledore. "I
estimate that it requires one more minute. Now, when the champions' names are
174called, I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall, walk along the
staff table, and go through into the next chamber" - he indicated the door behind
the staff table - "where they will be receiving their first instructions."
He took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it; at once, all the
candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished, plunging
them into a state of semidarkness. The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly
than anything in the whole Hall, the sparkling bright, bluey-whiteness of the
flames almost painful on the eyes. Everyone watched, waiting. . . . A few people
kept checking their watches. . .
"Any second," Lee Jordan whispered, two seats away from Harry.
The flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again. Sparks began to fly from
it. Next moment, a tongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of parchment
fluttered out of it - the whole room gasped.
Dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm's length, so that he
could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue-white.
"The champion for Durmstrang," he read, in a strong, clear voice, "will be Viktor
Krum."
"No surprises there!" yelled Ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the
Hall. Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up toward
Dumbledore; he turned right, walked along the staff table, and disappeared
through the door into the next chamber.
"Bravo, Viktor!" boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear him, even
over all the applause. "Knew you had it in you!"
The clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone's attention was focused again
on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A second piece of
parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.
"The champion for Beauxbatons," said Dumbledore, "is Fleur Delacour!"
"It's her, Ron!" Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully
to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the
Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.
"Oh look, they're all disappointed," Hermione said over the noise, nodding toward
the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. "Disappointed" was a bit of an
understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected had
dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.
When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell again,
but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it. The
Hogwarts champion next...
175And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the tongue
of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the third piece
of parchment.
"The Hogwarts champion," he called, "is Cedric Diggory!"
"No! " said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar from the
next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet,
screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them, grinning broadly, and
headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers' table. Indeed, the applause for
Cedric went on so long that it was some time before Dumbledore could make
himself heard again.
"Excellent!" Dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down. "Well, we
now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of you, including
the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to give your
champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your champion
on, you will contribute in a very real --"
But Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it was apparent to everybody
what had distracted him.
The fire in the goblet had just turned red again. Sparks were flying out of it. A
long flame shot suddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another piece of
parchment.
Automatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the
parchment. He held it out and stared at the name written upon it. There was a long
pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and everyone in
the room stared at Dumbledore. And then Dumbledore cleared his throat and read
out - "Harry Potter."
176CHAPTER SEVENTEEN - THE FOUR CHAMPIONS
Harry sat there, aware that every head in the Great Hall had turned to look at him.
He was stunned. He felt numb. He was surely dreaming. He had not heard
correctly.
There was no applause. A buzzing, as though of angry bees, was starting to fill the
Hall; some students were standing up to get a better look at Harry as he sat, frozen,
in his seat.
Up at the top table, Professor McGonagall had got to her feet and swept past Ludo
Bagman and Professor Karkaroff to whisper urgently to Professor Dumbledore,
who bent his ear toward her, frowning slightly.
Harry turned to Ron and Hermione; beyond them, he saw the long Gryffindor
table all watching him, openmouthed.
"I didn't put my name in," Harry said blankly. "You know I didn't."
Both of them stared just as blankly back.
At the top table, Professor Dumbledore had straightened up, nodding to Professor
McGonagall.
"Harry Potter!" he called again. "Harry! Up here, if you please!"
"Go on," Hermione whispered, giving Harry a slight push.
Harry got to his feet, trod on the hem of his robes, and stumbled slightly. He set
off up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables. It felt like an
immensely long walk; the top table didn't seem to be getting any nearer at all, and
he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him, as though each were a
searchlight. The buzzing grew louder and louder. After what seemed like an hour,
he was right in front of Dumbledore, feeling the stares of all the teachers upon
him.
"Well.. . through the door, Harry," said Dumbledore. He wasn't smiling.
Harry moved off along the teachers' table. Hagrid was seated right at the end. He
did not wink at Harry, or wave, or give any of his usual signs of greeting. He
looked completely astonished and stared at Harry as he passed like everyone else.
Harry went through the door out of the Great Hall and found himself in a smaller
room, lined with paintings of witches and wizards. A handsome fire was roaring in
the fireplace opposite him.
The faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered. He saw a wizened
witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the one next to it, which
177contained a wizard with a walrus mustache. The wizened witch started whispering
in his ear.
Viktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour were grouped around the fire.
They looked strangely impressive, silhouetted against the flames. Krum, hunched-
up and brooding, was leaning against the mantelpiece, slightly apart from the other
two. Cedric was standing with his hands behind his back, staring into the fire.
Fleur Delacour looked around when Harry walked in and threw back her sheet of
long, silvery hair.
"What is it?" she said. "Do zey want us back in ze Hall?"
She thought he had come to deliver a message. Harry didn't know how to explain
what had just happened. He just stood there, looking at the three champions. It
struck him how very tall all of them were.
There was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and Ludo Bagman entered the
room. He took Harry by the arm and led him forward.
"Extraordinary!" he muttered, squeezing Harry's arm. "Absolutely extraordinary!
Gentlemen. . . lady," he added, approaching the fireside and addressing the other
three. "May I introduce - incredible though it may seem - the fourth Triwizard
champion?"
Viktor Krum straightened up. His surly face darkened as he surveyed Harry.
Cedric looked nonplussed. He looked from Bagman to Harry and back again as
though sure he must have misheard what Bagman had said. Fleur Delacour,
however, tossed her hair, smiling, and said, "Oh, vairy funny joke, Meester
Bagman."
"Joke?" Bagman repeated, bewildered. "No, no, not at all! Harry's name just came
out of the Goblet of Fire!"
Krum's thick eyebrows contracted slightly. Cedric was still looking politely
bewildered. Fleur frowned.
"But evidently zair 'as been a mistake," she said contemptuously to Bagman. "E
cannot compete. 'E is too young."
"Well. . . it is amazing," said Bagman, rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down
at Harry. "But, as you know, the age restriction was only imposed this year as an
extra safety measure. And as his name's come out of the goblet.. . I mean, I don't
think there can be any ducking out at this stage. . . . It's down in the rules, you're
obliged. . . Harry will just have to do the best he --"
The door behind them opened again, and a large group of people came in:
Professor Dumbledore, followed closely by Mr. Crouch, Professor Karkaroff,
Madame Maxime, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Snape. Harry heard the
buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall, before Professor
178McGonagall closed the door.
"Madame Maxime!" said Fleur at once, striding over to her headmistress. "Zey are
saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!"
Somewhere under Harry's numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger. Little boy?
Madame Maxime had drawn herself up to her full, and considerable, height. The
top of her handsome head brushed the candle-filled chandelier, and her gigantic
black-satin bosom swelled.
"What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly-dorr?" she said imperiously. "I'd rather like to
know that myself, Dumbledore," said Professor Karkaroff. He was wearing a
steely smile, and his blue eyes were like chips of ice. "Two Hogwarts champions?
I don't remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions - or
have I not read the rules carefully enough?"
He gave a short and nasty laugh.
"C'est impossible," said Madame Maxime, whose enormous hand with its many
superb opals was resting upon Fleur's shoulder. "Ogwarts cannot 'ave two
champions. It is most injust."
"We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out younger
contestants, Dumbledore," said Karkaroff, his steely smile still in place, though his
eyes were colder than ever. "Otherwise, we would, of course, have brought along a
wider selection of candidates from our own schools."
"It's no one's fault but Potter's, Karkaroff," said Snape softly. His black eyes were
alight with malice. "Don't go blaming Dumbledore for Potter's determination to
break rules. He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here -"
"Thank you, Severus," said Dumbledore firmly, and Snape went quiet, though his
eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair.
Professor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry, who looked right back at
him, trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the half-moon spectacles.
"Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?" he asked calmly.
"No," said Harry. He was very aware of everybody watching him closely. Snape
made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadows.
"Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you?" said
Professor Dumbledore, ignoring Snape.
"No," said Harry vehemently.
"Ah, but of course 'e is lying!" cried Madame Maxime. Snape was now shaking
his head, his lip curling.
179"He could not have crossed the Age Line," said Professor McGonagall sharply. "I
am sure we are all agreed on that -"
"Dumbly-dorr must 'ave made a mistake wiz ze line," said Madame Maxime,
shrugging.
"It is possible, of course," said Dumbledore politely.
"Dumbledore, you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake!" said
Professor McGonagall angrily. "Really, what nonsense! Harry could not have
crossed the line himself, and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not
persuade an older student to do it for him, I'm sure that should be good enough for
everybody else!"
She shot a very angry look at Professor Snape.
"Mr. Crouch.. . Mr. Bagman," said Karkaroff, his voice unctuous once more, "you
are our - er - objective judges. Surely you will agree that this is most irregular?"
Bagman wiped his round, boyish face with his handkerchief and looked at Mr.
Crouch, who was standing outside the circle of the firelight, his face half hidden in
shadow. He looked slightly eerie, the half darkness making him look much older,
giving him an almost skull-like appearance. When he spoke, however, it was in his
usual curt voice.
"We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose
names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament."
"Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front," said Bagman, beaming and
turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter was now
closed.
"I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students," said Karkaroff.
He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His face wore a very ugly
look indeed. "You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more, and we will continue
adding names until each school has two champions. It's only fair, Dumbledore."
"But Karkaroff, it doesn't work like that," said Bagman. "The Goblet of Fire's just
gone out - it won't reignite until the start of the next tournament -"
"- in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing!" exploded
Karkaroff. "After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little
expected something of this nature to occur! I have half a mind to leave now!"
"Empty threat, Karkaroff," growled a voice from near the door. "You can't leave
your champion now. He's got to compete. They've all got to compete. Binding
magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh?"
Moody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire, and with every right
step he took, there was a loud clunk.
180"Convenient?" said Karkaroff. "I'm afraid I don't understand you, Moody."
Harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody was
saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him away; they had balled
themselves into fists.
"Don't you?" said Moody quietly. "It's very simple, Karkaroff. Someone put
Potter's name in that goblet knowing he'd have to compete if it came out."
"Evidently, someone 'oo wished to give 'Ogwarts two bites at ze apple!" said
Madame Maxime.
"I quite agree, Madame Maxime," said Karkaroff, bowing to her. "I shall be
lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the International
Confederation of Wizards -"
"If anyone's got reason to complain, it's Potter," growled Moody, "but. . . funny
thing. . . I don't hear him saying a word. . .
"Why should 'e complain?" burst out Fleur Delacour, stamping her foot. "E 'as ze
chance to compete, 'asn't 'e? We 'ave all been 'oping to be chosen for weeks and
weeks! Ze honor for our schools! A thousand Galleons in prize money - zis is a
chance many would die for!"
"Maybe someone's hoping Potter is going to die for it," said Moody, with the
merest trace of a growl.
An extremely tense silence followed these words. Ludo Bagman, who was looking
very anxious indeed, bounced nervously up and down on his feet and said,
"Moody, old man. . . what a thing to say!"
"We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he hasn't
discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime," said Karkaroff loudly.
"Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too. An odd
quality in a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dumbledore, but no doubt you
had your reasons.
"Imagining things, am I?" growled Moody. "Seeing things, eh? It was a skilled
witch or wizard who put the boy's name in that goblet. . .
"Ah, what evidence is zere of zat?" said Madame Maxime, throwing up her huge
hands.
"Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object!" said Moody. "It
would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that
goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament.. . . I'm
guessing they submitted Potter's name under a fourth school, to make sure he was
the only one in his category.. . ."
"You seem to have given this a great deal of thought, Moody," said Karkaroff
181coldly, "and a very ingenious theory it is - though of course, I heard you recently
got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly
disguised basilisk egg, and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage
clock. So you'll understand if we don't take you entirely seriously. . . ."
"There are those who'll turn innocent occasions to their advantage," Moody
retorted in a menacing voice. "It's my job to think the way Dark wizards do,
Karkaroff - as you ought to remember...
"Alastor!" said Dumbledore warningly. Harry wondered for a moment whom he
was speaking to, but then realized "Mad-Eye" could hardly be Moody's real first
name. Moody fell silent, though still surveying Karkaroff with satisfaction -
Karkaroff's face was burning.
"How this situation arose, we do not know," said Dumbledore, speaking to
everyone gathered in the room. "It seems to me, however, that we have no choice
but to accept it. Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete in the
Tournament. This, therefore, they will do. . .
"Ah, but Dumbly-dorr -"
"My dear Madame Maxime, if you have an alternative, I would be delighted to
hear it."
Dumbledore waited, but Madame Maxime did not speak, she merely glared. She
wasn't the only one either. Snape looked furious; Karkaroff livid; Bagman,
however, looked rather excited.
"Well, shall we crack on, then?" he said, rubbing his hands together and smiling
around the room. "Got to give our champions their instructions, haven't we? Barty,
want to do the honors?"
Mr. Crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie.
"Yes," he said, "instructions. Yes . . . the first task . . ."
He moved forward into the firelight. Close up, Harry thought he looked ill. There
were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin, papery look about his wrinkled
skin that had not been there at the Quidditch World Cup.
"The first task is designed to test your daring," he told Harry, Cedric, Fleur, and
Viktor, "so we are not going to be telling you what it is. Courage in the face of the
unknown is an important quality in a wizard. . . very important.
"The first task will take place on November the twenty-fourth, in front of the other
students and the panel of judges.
"The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their
teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament. The champions will face the first
challenge armed only with their wands. They will receive information about the
182second task when the first is over. Owing to the demanding and time-consuming
nature of the tournament, the champions are exempted from end-of-year tests."
Mr. Crouch turned to look at Dumbledore.
"I think that's all, is it, Albus?"
"I think so," said Dumbledore, who was looking at Mr. Crouch with mild concern.
"Are you sure you wouldn't like to stay at Hogwarts tonight, Barty?"
"No, Dumbledore, I must get back to the Ministry," said Mr. Crouch. "It is a very
busy, very difficult time at the moment.... I've left young Weatherby in charge.. . .
Very enthusiastic. . . a little overenthusiastic, if truth be told. . .
"You'll come and have a drink before you go, at least?" said Dumbledore.
"Come on, Barry, I'm staying!" said Bagman brightly. "It's all happening at
Hogwarts now, you know, much more exciting here than at the office!"
"I think not, Ludo," said Crouch with a touch of his old impatience.
"Professor Karkaroff - Madame Maxime - a nightcap?" said Dumbledore.
But Madame Maxime had already put her arm around Fleur's shoulders and was
leading her swiftly out of the room. Harry could hear them both talking very fast
in French as they went off into the Great Hall. Karkaroff beckoned to Krum, and
they, too, exited, though in silence.
"Harry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed," said Dumbledore, smiling at both of
them. "I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you, and
it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal
of mess and noise."
Harry glanced at Cedric, who nodded, and they left together.
The Great Hall was deserted now; the candles had burned low, giving the jagged
smiles of the pumpkins an eerie, flickering quality.
"So," said Cedric, with a slight smile. "We're playing against each other again!"
"I s'pose," said Harry. He really couldn't think of anything to say. The inside of his
head seemed to be in complete disarray, as though his brain had been ransacked.
"So. . . tell me. . ." said Cedric as they reached the entrance hall, which was now lit
only by torches in the absence of the Goblet of Fire. "How did you get your name
in?"
"I didn't," said Harry, staring up at him. "I didn't put it in. I was telling the truth."
"Ah. . . okay," said Cedric. Harry could tell Cedric didn't believe him. "Well . . .
see you, then."
183Instead of going up the marble staircase, Cedric headed for a door to its right.
Harry stood listening to him going down the stone steps beyond it, then, slowly, he
started to climb the marble ones.
Was anyone except Ron and Hermione going to believe him, or would they all
think he'd put himself in for the tournament? Yet how could anyone think that,
when he was facing competitors who'd had three years' more magical education
than he had - when he was now facing tasks that not only sounded very dangerous,
but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people? Yes, he'd thought
about it. . . he'd fantasized about it.. . but it had been a joke, really, an idle sort of
dream. . . he'd never really, seriously considered entering. .
But someone else had considered it. . . someone else had wanted him in the
tournament, and had made sure he was entered. Why? To give him a treat? He
didn't think so, somehow...
To see him make a fool of himself? Well, they were likely to get their wish. .
But to get him killed?
Was Moody just being his usual paranoid self? Couldn't someone have put Harry's
name in the goblet as a trick, a practical joke? Did anyone really want him dead?
Harry was able to answer that at once. Yes, someone wanted him dead, someone
had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year old. . . Lord Voldemort. But
how could Voldemort have ensured that Harry's name got into the Goblet of Fire?
Voldemort was supposed to be far away, in some distant country, in hiding, alone.
. . feeble and powerless....
Yet in that dream he had had, just before he had awoken with his scar hurting,
Voldemort had not been alone. . . he had been talking to Wormtail.. . plotting
Harry's murder.
Harry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat Lady already. He had barely
noticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she was
not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor's
painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly
beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every picture lining seven
staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down
at him with the keenest interest.
"Well, well, well," said the Fat Lady, "Violet's just told me everything. Who's just
been chosen as school champion, then?"
"Balderdash," said Harry dully.
"It most certainly isn't!" said the pale witch indignantly.
"No, no, Vi, it's the password," said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung
forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room.
184The blast of noise that met Harry's ears when the portrait opened almost knocked
him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common
room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor
House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.
"You should've told us you'd entered!" bellowed Fred; he looked half annoyed,
half deeply impressed.
"How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!" roared George.
"I didn't," Harry said. "I don't know how -"
But Angelina had now swooped down upon him; "Oh if it couldn't be me, at least
it's a Gryffindor -"
"You'll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match, Harry!"
shrieked Katie Bell, another of the Gryffindor Chasers.
"We've got food, Harry, come and have some -"
"I'm not hungry, I had enough at the feast -"
But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn't hungry; nobody wanted to hear that he
hadn't put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to have noticed
that he wasn't at all in the mood to celebrate. . . . Lee Jordan had unearthed a
Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around Harry
like a cloak. Harry couldn't get away; whenever he tried to sidle over to the
staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks, forcing another
butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands. . . . Everyone wanted
to know how he had done it, how he had tricked Dumbledore's Age Line and
managed to get his name into the goblet....
"I didn't," he said, over and over again, "I don't know how it happened."
But for all the notice anyone took, he might just as well not have answered at all.
"I'm tired!" he bellowed finally, after nearly half an hour. "No, seriously, George -
I'm going to bed -"
He wanted more than anything to find Ron and Hermione, to find a bit of sanity,
but neither of them seemed to be in the common room. Insisting that he needed to
sleep, and almost flattening the little Creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay
him at the foot of the stairs, Harry managed to shake everyone off and climb up to
the dormitory as fast as he could.
To his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise empty
dormitory, still fully dressed. He looked up when Harry slammed the door behind
him.
"Where've you been?" Harry said.
185"Oh hello," said Ron.
He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. Harry suddenly
became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had
tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly. Ron lay
on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.
"So," he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a
corner. "Congratulations."
"What d'you mean, congratulations?" said Harry, staring at Ron. There was
definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling: It was more like a
grimace.
"Well. . . no one else got across the Age Line," said Ron. "Not even Fred and
George. What did you use - the Invisibility Cloak?"
"The Invisibility Cloak wouldn't have got me over that line," said Harry slowly.
"Oh right," said Ron. "I thought you might've told me if it was the cloak. . .
because it would've covered both of us, wouldn't it? But you found another way,
did you?"
"Listen," said Harry, "I didn't put my name in that goblet. Someone else must've
done it."
Ron raised his eyebrows.
"What would they do that for?"
"I dunno," said Harry. He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, "To kill
me."
Ron's eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair.
"It's okay, you know, you can tell me the truth," he said. "If you don't want
everyone else to know, fine, but I don't know why you're bothering to lie, you
didn't get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady's, that Violet,
she's already told us all Dumbledore's letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize
money, eh? And you don't have to do end-of-year tests either. . ."
"I didn't put my name in that goblet!" said Harry, starting to feel angry.
"Yeah, okay," said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric. "Only you
said this morning you'd have done it last night, and no one would've seen you.. . .
I'm not stupid, you know."
"You're doing a really good impression of it," Harry snapped.
"Yeah?" said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his
face now. "You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you'll need to be up early
186tomorrow for a photo-call or something."
He wrenched the hangings shut around his four-poster, leaving Harry standing
there by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding one of the few
people he had been sure would believe him.
187CHAPTER EIGHTEEN - THE WEIGHING OF THE WANDS
When Harry woke up on Sunday morning, it took him a moment to remember why
he felt so miserable and worried. Then the memory of the previous night rolled
over him. He sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own four-poster, intending
to talk to Ron, to force Ron to believe him - only to find that Ron's bed was empty;
he had obviously gone down to breakfast.
Harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room. The
moment he appeared, the people who had already finished breakfast broke into
applause again. The prospect of going down into the Great Hall and facing the rest
of the Gryffindors, all treating him like some sort of hero, was not inviting; it was
that, however, or stay here and allow himself to be cornered by the Creevey
brothers, who were both beckoning frantically to him to join them. He walked
resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open, climbed out of it, and found
himself face-to-face with Hermione.
"Hello," she said, holding up a stack of toast, which she was carrying in a napkin.
"I brought you this. . . . Want to go for a walk?"
"Good idea," said Harry gratefully.
They went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in at the
Great Hall, and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake, where the
Durmstrang ship was moored, reflected blackly in the water. It was a chilly
morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione
exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before.
To his immense relief, Hermione accepted his story without question.
"Well, of course I knew you hadn't entered yourself," she said when he'd finished
telling her about the scene in the chamber off the Hall. "The look on your face
when Dumbledore read out your name! But the question is, who did put it in?
Because Moody's right, Harry... I don't think any student could have done it. . .
they'd never be able to fool the Goblet, or get over Dumbledore's -"
"Have you seen Ron?" Harry interrupted.
Hermione hesitated.
"Erm. . . yes. . . he was at breakfast," she said.
"Does he still think I entered myself?"
"Well. . . no, I don't think so . . . not really," said Hermione awkwardly.
"What's that supposed to mean, 'not really'?"
188"Oh Harry, isn't it obvious?" Hermione said despairingly. "He's jealous!"
"Jealous?" Harry said incredulously. "Jealous of what? He wants to make a prat of
himself in front of the whole school, does he?"
"Look," said Hermione patiently, "it's always you who gets all the attention, you
know it is. I know it's not your fault," she added quickly, seeing Harry open his
mouth furiously. "I know you don't ask for it.. . but - well - you know, Ron's got
all those brothers to compete against at home, and you're his best friend, and
you're really famous - he's always shunted to one side whenever people see you,
and he puts up with it, and he never mentions it, but I suppose this is just one time
too many. . .
"Great," said Harry bitterly. "Really great. Tell him from me I'll swap any time he
wants. Tell him from me he's welcome to it.... People gawping at my forehead
everywhere I go. . ."
"I'm not teiling him anything," Hermione said shortly. "Tell him yourself. It's the
only way to sort this out."
"I'm not running around after him trying to make him grow up!" Harry said, so
loudly that several owls in a nearby tree took flight in alarm. "Maybe he'll believe
I'm not enjoying myself once I've got my neck broken or -"
"That's not funny," said Hermione quietly. "That's not funny at all." She looked
extremely anxious. "Harry, I've been thinking - you know what we've got to do,
don't you? Straight away, the moment we get back to the castle?"
"Yeah, give Ron a good kick up the -"
"Write to Sirius. You've got to tell him what's happened. He asked you to keep
him posted on everything that's going on at Hogwarts. . . . It's almost as if he
expected something like this to happen. I brought some parchment and a quill out
with me -"
"Come off it," said Harry, looking around to check that they couldn't be overheard,
but the grounds were quite deserted. "He came back to the country just because
my scar twinged. He'll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him
someone's entered me in the Triwizard Tournament -"
"He'd want you to tell him," said Hermione sternly. "He's going to find out
anyway."
"How?"
"Harry, this isn't going to be kept quiet," said Hermione, very seriously. "This
tournament's famous, and you're famous. I'll be really surprised if there isn't
anything in the Daily Prophet about you competing. . . . You're already in half the
books about You-Know-Who, you know.. . and Sirius would rather hear it from
you, I know he would."
189"Okay, okay, I'll write to him," said Harry, throwing his last piece of toast into the
lake. They both stood and watched it floating there for a moment, before a large
tentacle rose out of the water and scooped it beneath the surface. Then they
returned to the castle.
"Whose owl am I going to use?" Harry said as they climbed the stairs. "He told me
not to use Hedwig again."
"Ask Ron if you can borrow -"
"I'm not asking Ron for anything," Harry said flatly.
"Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use them," said Hermione.
They went up to the Owlery. Hermione gave Harry a piece of parchment, a quill,
and a bottle of ink, then strolled around the long lines of perches, looking at all the
different owls, while Harry sat down against a wall and wrote his letter.
Dear Sirius,
You told me to keep you posted on what's happening at Hogwarts, so here goes - I
don't know if you've heard, but the Triwizard Tournament's happening this year
and on Saturday night I got picked as a fourth champion. I don't who put my name
in the Goblet of Fire, because I didn't. The other Hogwarts champion is Cedric
Diggory, from Hufflepuff
He paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something about the large
weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night, but
he couldn't think how to translate this into words, so he simply dipped his quill
back into the ink bottle and wrote,
Hope you're okay, and Buckbeak - Harry
"Finished," he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes.
At this, Hedwig fluttered down onto his shoulder and held out her leg.
"I can't use you," Harry told her, looking around for the school owls. "I've got to
use one of these."
Hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her talons cut into his
shoulder. She kept her back to Harry all the time he was tying his letter to the leg
of a large barn owl. When the barn owl had flown off, Harry reached out to stroke
Hedwig, but she clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the rafters out of
reach.
"First Ron, then you," Harry said angrily. "This isn't my fault."
If Harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the
idea of him being champion, the following day showed him how mistaken he was.
He could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons - and it
190was clear that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors, thought Harry had
entered himself for the tournament. Unlike the Gryffindors, however, they did not
seem impressed.
The Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors, had
turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them. One Herbology lesson was
enough to demonstrate this. It was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had
stolen their champion's glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that
Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric was one of the few
who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor once at Quidditch. Ernie
Macmillan and Justin FinchFletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very
well, did not talk to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the
same tray - though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing
Bulbs wriggled free from Harry's grip and smacked him hard in the face. Ron
wasn't talking to Harry either. Hermione sat between them, making very forced
conversation, but though both answered her normally, they avoided making eye
contact with each other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with
him - but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.
He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal
circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too - the
first time he would come face-to-face with them since becoming champion.
Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid's cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in
place.
"Ah, look, boys, it's the champion," he said to Crabbe and Goyle the moment he
got within earshot of Harry. "Got your autograph books? Better get a signature
now, because I doubt he's going to be around much longer. . . . Half the Triwizard
champions have died.. . how long d'you reckon you're going to last, Potter? Ten
minutes into the first task's my bet."
Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to stop there,
because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of
crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended Skrewt. To the class's horror,
Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one
another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution would be for each
student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk. The only good thing
about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy completely.
"Take this thing for a walk?" he repeated in disgust, staring into one of the boxes.
"And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash? Around the sting, the
blasting end, or the sucker?"
"Roun' the middle," said Hagrid, demonstrating. "Er - yeh might want ter put on
yer dragon-hide gloves, jus' as an extra precaution, like. Harry - you come here an'
help me with this big one....
191Hagrid's real intention, however, was totalk to Harry away from the rest of the
class. He waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then turned to
Harry and said, very seriously, "So - yer competin', Harry. In the tournament.
School champion."
"One of the champions," Harry corrected him.
Hagrid's beetle-black eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrows.
"No idea who put yeh in fer it, Harry?"
"You believe I didn't do it, then?" said Harry, concealing with difficulty the rush
of gratitude he felt at Hagrid's words.
"Course I do," Hagrid grunted. "Yeh say it wasn' you, an' I believe yeh - an'
Dumbledore believes yer, an' all."
"Wish I knew who did do it," said Harry bitterly.
The pair of them looked out over the lawn; the class was widely scattered now,
and all in great difficulty. The skrewts were now over three feet long, and
extremely powerful. No longer shell-less and colorless, they had developed a kind
of thick, grayish, shiny armor. They looked like a cross between giant scorpions
and elongated crabs - but still without recognizable heads or eyes. They had
become immensely strong and very hard to control.
"Look like they're havin' fun, don' they?" Hagrid said happily. Harry assumed he
was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren't; every now
and then, with an alarming bang, one of the skrewts' ends would explode, causing
it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged
along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet.
"Ah, I don' know, Harry," Hagrid sighed suddenly, looking back down at him with
a worried expression on his face. "School champion. . . everythin' seems ter
happen ter you, doesn' it?"
Harry didn't answer. Yes, everything did seem to happen to him. . . that was more
or less what Hermione had said as they had walked around the lake, and that was
the reason, according to her, that Ron was no longer talking to him.
The next few days were some of Harry's worst at Hogwarts. The closest he had
ever come to feeling like this had been during those months, in his second year,
when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow students.
But Ron had been on his side then. He thought he could have coped with the rest
of the school's behavior if he could just have had Ron back as a friend, but he
wasn't going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron didn't want to.
Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sides.
He could understand the Hufflepuffs' attitude, even if he didn't like it; they had
their own champion to support. He expected nothing less than vicious insults from
192the Slytherins - he was highly unpopular there and always had been, because he
had helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at Quidditch and in the Inter-
House Championship. But he had hoped the Ravenclaws might have found it in
their hearts to support him as much as Cedric. He was wrong, however. Most
Ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more
fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name.
Then there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of a champion so much more
than he did. Exceptionally handsome, with his straight nose, dark hair, and gray
eyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days, Cedric or
Viktor Krum. Harry actually saw the same sixth-year girls who had been so keen
to get Krum's autograph begging Cedric to sign their school bags one lunchtime.
Meanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing to come
anywhere near him, Professor Trelawney was predicting his death with even more
certainty than usual, and he did so badly at Summoning Charms in Professor
Flitwick's class that he was given extra homework - the only person to get any,
apart from Neville.
"It's really not that difficult, Harry," Hermione tried to reassure him as they left
Flitwick's class - she had been making objects zoom across the room to her all
lesson, as though she were some sort of weird magnet for board dusters,
wastepaper baskets, and lunascopes. "You just weren't concentrating properly -"
"Wonder why that was," said Harry darkly as Cedric Diggory walked past,
surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of whom looked at Harry as
though he were a particularly large Blast-Ended Skrewt. "Still - never mind, eh?
Double Potions to look forward to this afternoon. . ."
Double Potions was always a horrible experience, but these days it was nothing
short of torture. Being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with Snape and the
Slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to punish Harry as much as possible
for daring to become school champion, was about the most unpleasant thing Harry
could imagine. He had already struggled through one Friday's worth, with
Hermione sitting next to him intoning "ignore them, ignore them, ignore them"
under her breath, and he couldn't see why today should be any better.
When he and Hermione arrived at Snape's dungeon after lunch, they found the
Slytherins waiting outside, each and every one of them wearing a large badge on
the front of his or her robes. For one wild moment Harry thought they were
S.P.E.W. badges - then he saw that they all bore the same message, in luminous
red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passage:
SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY--
THE REAL HOGWARTS CHAMPION!
"Like them, Potter?" said Malfoy loudly as Harry approached. "And this isn't all
they do - look!"
193He pressed his badge into his chest, and the message upon it vanished, to be
replaced by another one, which glowed green:
POTTER STINKS!
The Slytherins howled with laughter. Each of them pressed their badges too, until
the message POTTER STINKS was shining brightly all around Harry. He felt the
heat rise in his face and neck.
"Oh very funny," Hermione said sarcastically to Pansy Parkinson and her gang of
Slytherin girls, who were laughing harder than anyone, "really witty."
Ron was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus. He wasn't laughing, but
he wasn't sticking up for Harry either.
"Want one, Granger?" said Malfoy, holding out a badge to Hermione. "I've got
loads. But don't touch my hand, now. I've just washed it, you see; don't want a
Mudblood sliming it up."
Some of the anger Harry had been feeling for days and days seemed to burst
through a dam in his chest. He had reached for his wand before he'd thought what
he was doing. People all around them scrambled out of the way, backing down the
corridor.
"Harry!" Hermione said warningly.
"Go on, then, Potter," Malfoy said quietly, drawing out his own wand. "Moody's
not here to look after you now - do it, if you've got the guts -"
For a split second, they looked into each other's eyes, then, at exactly the same
time, both acted.
"Funnunculus!" Harry yelled.
"Densaugeo!" screamed Malfoy.
Jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and ricocheted off at
angles -- Harry's hit Goyle in the face, and Malfoy's hit Hermione. Goyle bellowed
and put his hands to his nose, where great ugly boils were springing up -
Hermione, whimpering in panic, was clutching her mouth.
"Hermione!"
Ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her; Harry turned and saw
Ron dragging Hermione's hand away from her face. It wasn't a pretty sight.
Hermione's front teeth - already larger than average - were now growing at an
alarming rate; she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated,
past her bottom lip, toward her chin - panic-stricken, she felt them and let out a
terrified cry.
"And what is all this noise about?" said a soft, deadly voice.
194Snape had arrived. The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations; Snape
pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said, "Explain."
"Potter attacked me, sir -"
"We attacked each other at the same time!" Harry shouted.
"- and he hit Goyle - look -"
Snape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something that would have
been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.
"Hospital wing, Goyle," Snape said calmly.
"Malfoy got Hermione!" Ron said. "Look!"
He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth - she was doing her best to hide them
with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her
collar. Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent
giggles, pointing at Hermione from behind Snape's back.
Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, "I see no difference.".
Hermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears, she turned on her heel and
ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight.
It was lucky, perhaps, that both Harry and Ron started shouting at Snape at the
same time; lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for in the
confused din, it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling
him. He got the gist, however.
"Let's see," he said, in his silkiest voice. "Fifty points from Gryffindor and a
detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get inside, or it'll be a week's worth of
detentions."
Harry's ears were ringing. The injustice of it made him want to curse Snape into a
thousand slimy pieces. He passed Snape, walked with Ron to the back of the
dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto the table. Ron was shaking with anger
too - for a moment, it felt as though everything was back to normal between them,
but then Ron turned and sat down with Dean and Seamus instead, leaving Harry
alone at his table. On the other side of the dungeon, Malfoy turned his back on
Snape and pressed his badge, smirking. POTTER STINKS flashed once more
across the room.
Harry sat there staring at Snape as the lesson began, picturing horrific things
happening to him. . . . If only he knew how to do the Cruciatus Curse. . . he'd have
Snape flat on his back like that spider, jerking and twitching.
"Antidotes!" said Snape, looking around at them all, his cold black eyes glittering
unpleasantly. "You should all have prepared your recipes now. I want you to brew
195them carefully, and then, we will be selecting someone on whom to test one. . ."
Snape's eyes met Harry's, and Harry knew what was coming. Snape was going to
poison him. Harry imagined picking up his cauldron, and sprinting to the front of
the class, and bringing it down on Snape's greasy head - And then a knock on the
dungeon door burst in on Harry's thoughts.
It was Colin Creevey; he edged into the room, beaming at Harry, and walked up to
Snape's desk at the front of the room.
"Yes?" said Snape curtly.
"Please, sir, I'm supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs." Snape stared down his
hooked nose at Colin, whose smile faded from his eager face.
"Potter has another hour of Potions to complete," said Snape coldly. "He will
come upstairs when this class is finished."
Colin went pink.
"Sir - sir, Mr. Bagman wants him," he said nervously. "All the champions have got
to go, I think they want to take photographs. . ."
Harry would have given anything he owned to have stopped Colin saying those
last few words. He chanced half a glance at Ron, but Ron was staring
determinedly at the ceiling.
"Very well, very well," Snape snapped. "Potter, leave your things here, I want you
back down here later to test your antidote."
"Please, sir - he's got to take his things with him," squeaked Cohn. "All the
champions..."
"Very well!" said Snape. "Potter - take your bag and get out of my sight!"
Harry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and headed for the door. As he
walked through the Slytherin desks, POTTER STINKS flashed at him from every
direction.
"It's amazing, isn't it, Harry?" said Colin, starting to speak the moment Harry had
closed the dungeon door behind him. "Isn't it, though? You being champion?"
"Yeah, really amazing," said Harry heavily as they set off toward the steps into the
entrance hall. "What do they want photos for, Colin?"
"The Daily Prophet, I think!"
"Great," said Harry dully. "Exactly what I need. More publicity."
"Good luck!" said Colin when they had reached the right room. Harry knocked on
the door and entered.
196He was in a fairly small classroom; most of the desks had been pushed away to the
back of the room, leaving a large space in the middle; three of them, however, had
been placed end-to-end in front of the blackboard and covered with a long length
of velvet. Five chairs had been set behind the velvet-covered desks, and Ludo
Bagman was sitting in one of them, talking to a witch Harry had never seen
before, who was wearing magenta robes.
Viktor Krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual and not talking to
anybody. Cedric and Fheur were in conversation. Fheur looked a good deal
happier than Harry had seen her so far; she kept throwing back her head so that her
long silvery hair caught the light. A paunchy man, holding a large black camera
that was smoking slightly, was watching Fleur out of the corner of his eye.
Bagman suddenly spotted Harry, got up quickly, and bounded forward.
"Ah, here he is! Champion number four! In you come, Harry, in you come.. .
nothing to worry about, it's just the wand weighing ceremony, the rest of the
judges will be here in a moment -"
"Wand weighing?" Harry repeated nervously.
"We have to check that your wands are fully functional, no problems, you know,
as they're your most important tools in the tasks ahead," said Bagman. "The
expert's upstairs now with Dumbledore. And then there's going to be a little photo
shoot. This is Rita Skeeter," he added, gesturing toward the witch in magenta
robes. "She's doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily Prophet. .. ."
"Maybe not that small, Ludo," said Rita Skeeter, her eyes on Harry.
Her hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly with
her heavy-jawed face. She wore jeweled spectacles. The thick fingers clutching
her crocodile-skin handbag ended in two-inch nails, painted crimson.
"I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start?" she said to
Bagman, but still gazing fixedly at Harry. "The youngest champion, you know. . .
to add a bit of color?"
"Certainly!" cried Bagman. "That is - if Harry has no objection?"
"Er -" said Harry.
"Lovely," said Rita Skeeter, and in a second, her scarlet-taloned fingers had
Harry's upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip, and she was steering him out of the
room again and opening a nearby door.
"We don't want to be in there with all that noise," she said. "Let's see . . . ah, yes,
this is nice and cozy."
It was a broom cupboard. Harry stared at her.
197"Come along, dear - that's right - lovely," said Rita Skeeter again, perching herself
precariously upon an upturned bucket, pushing Harry down onto a cardboard box,
and closing the door, throwing them into darkness. "Let's see now. ."
She unsnapped her crocodile-skin handbag and pulled out a handful of candles,
which she lit with a wave of her wand and magicked into midair, so that they
could see what they were doing.
"You won't mind, Harry, if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill? It leaves me free to talk to
you normally. .."
"A what?" said Harry.
Rita Skeeter's smile widened. Harry counted three gold teeth. She reached again
into her crocodile bag and drew out a long acid-green quill and a roll of
parchment, which she stretched out between them on a crate of Mrs. Skower's All-
Purpose Magical Mess Remover. She put the tip of the green quill into her mouth,
sucked it for a moment with apparent relish, then placed it upright on the
parchment, where it stood balanced on its point, quivering slightly.
"Testing. . . my name is Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter."
Harry hooked down quickly at the quill. The moment Rita Skeeter had spoken, the
green quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment:
Attractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty-three, who's savage quill has punctured many
inflated reputations -
"Lovely," said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top piece of parchment
off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her handbag. Now she leaned toward Harry
and said, "So, Harry... what made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament?"
"Er -" said Harry again, but he was distracted by the quill. Even though he wasn't
speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in its wake he could make out
a fresh sentence:
An ugly scar, souvenier of a tragic past, disfigures the otherwise charming face of
Harry Potter, whose eyes --
"Ignore the quill, Harry," said Rita Skeeter firmly. Reluctantly Harry looked up at
her instead. "Now -- why did you decide to enter the tournament, Harry?"
"I didn't," said Harry. "I don't know how my name got into the Goblet of Fire. I
didn't put it in there."
Rita Skeeter raised one heavily penciled eyebrow.
"Come now, Harry, there's no need to be scared of getting into trouble. We all
know you shouldn't really have entered at all. But don't worry about that. Our
readers hove a rebel."
198"But I didn't enter," Harry repeated. "I don't know who -"
"How do you feel about the tasks ahead?" said Rita Skeeter. "Excited? Nervous?"
"I haven't really thought. . . yeah, nervous, I suppose," said Harry. His insides
squirmed uncomfortably as he spoke.
"Champions have died in the past, haven't they?" said Rita Skeeter briskly. "Have
you thought about that at all?"
"Well. . . they say it's going to be a lot safer this year," said Harry.
The quill whizzed across the parchment between them, back and forward as
though it were skating.
"Of course, you've looked death in the face before, haven't you?" said Rita
Skeeter, watching him closely. "How would you say that's affected you?"
"Er," said Harry, yet again.
"Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove
yourself? To live up to your name? Do you think that perhaps you were tempted to
enter the Triwizard Tournament because - "
"I didn't enter," said Harry, starting to feel irritated.
"Can you remember your parents at all?" said Rita Skeeter, talking over him.
"No," said Harry.
"How do you think they'd feel if they knew you were competing in the Triwizard
Tournament? Proud? Worried? Angry?"
Harry was feeling really annoyed now. How on earth was he to know how his
parents would feel if they were alive? He could feel Rita Skeeter watching him
very intently. Frowning, he avoided her gaze and hooked down at words the quill
had just written:
Tears fill those startlingly green eyes as our conversation turns to the parents he
can barely remember.
"I have NOT got tears in my eyes!" said Harry loudly.
Before Rita Skeeter could say a word, the door of the broom cupboard was pulled
open. Harry looked around, blinking in the bright light. Albus Dumbledore stood
there, looking down at both of them, squashed into the cupboard.
"Dumbledore!" cried Rita Skeeter, with every appearance of delight - but Harry
noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from the box of
Magical Mess Remover, and Rita's clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the
clasp of her crocodile-skin bag. "How are you?" she said, standing up and holding
199out one of her large, mannish hands to Dumbledore. "I hope you saw my piece
over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards' Conference?"
"Enchantingly nasty," said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. "I particularly enjoyed
your description of me as an obsolete dingbat."
Rita Skeeter didn't look remotely abashed.
"I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old-fashioned,
Dumbhedore, and that many wizards in the street -"
"I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness, Rita," said
Dumbledore, with a courteous bow and a smile, "but I'm afraid we will have to
discuss the matter later. The Weighing of the Wands is about to start, and it cannot
take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard."
Very glad to get away from Rita Skeeter, Harry hurried back into the room. The
other champions were now sitting in chairs near the door, and he sat down quickly
next to Cedric, hooking up at the velvet-covered table, where four of the five
judges were now sitting - Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Mr. Crouch, and
Ludo Bagman. Rita Skeeter settled herself down in a corner; Harry saw her slip
the parchment out of her bag again, spread it on her knee, suck the end of the
Quick-Quotes Quill, and place it once more on the parchment.
"May I introduce Mr. Ollivander?" said Dumbledore, taking his place at the
judges' table and talking to the champions. "He will be checking your wands to
ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament."
Harry hooked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with large,
pale eyes standing quietly by the window. Harry had met Mr. Ollivander before -
he was the wand-maker from whom Harry had bought his own wand over three
years ago in Diagon Alley.
"Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first, please?" said Mr. Ollivander,
stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room.
Fleur Delacour swept over to Mr. Olhivander and handed him her wand.
"Hmm..." he said.
He twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a number
of pink and gold sparks. Then he held it chose to his eyes and examined it
carefully.
"Yes," he said quietly, "nine and a half inches. . . inflexible.. rosewood.. . and
containing. . . dear me. . ."
"An 'air from ze 'ead of a veela," said Fleur. "One of my grandmuzzer's."
So Fleur was part veela, thought Harry, making a mental note to tell Ron. . . then
200he remembered that Ron wasn't speaking to him.
"Yes," said Mr. Ollivander, "yes, I've never used veela hair myself, of course. I
find it makes for rather temperamental wands...however, to each his own, and if
this suits you.."
Mr. Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand, apparently checking for scratches
or bumps; then he muttered, "Orchideous!" and a bunch of flowers burst from the
wand tip.
"Very well, very well, it's in fine working order," said Mr. Ollivander, scooping up
the flowers and handing them to Fleur with her wand. "Mr. Diggory, you next."
Fleur glided back to her seat, smiling at Cedric as he passed her.
"Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn't it?" said Mr. Ollivander, with much more
enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand. "Yes, I remember it well. Containing
a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn. . . must have been
seventeen hands; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail. Twelve
and a quarter inches. . . ash. . . pleasantly springy. It's in fine condition...You treat
it regularly?"
"Polished it last night," said Cedric, grinning.
Harry hooked down at his own wand. He could see finger marks all over it. He
gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to rub it clean surreptitiously.
Several gold sparks shot out of the end of it. Fleur Delacour gave him a very
patronizing look, and he desisted.
Mr. Ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the room from the tip of
Cedric's wand, pronounced himself satisfied, and then said, "Mr. Krum, if you
please."
Viktor Krum got up and slouched, round-shouldered and duck-footed, toward Mr.
Ollivander. He thrust out his wand and stood scowling, with his hands in the
pockets of his robes.
"Hmm," said Mr. Olhivander, "this is a Gregorovitch creation, unless I'm much
mistaken? A fine wand-maker, though the styling is never quite what I. . .
however. ."
He lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over and over before his
eyes.
"Yes.. . hornbeam and dragon heartstring?" he shot at Krum, who nodded. "Rather
thicker than one usually sees. . . quite rigid. . . ten and a quarter inches. . . Avis!"
The hornbeam wand let off a blast hike a gun, and a number of small, twittering
birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the watery sunlight.
201"Good," said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand. "Which leaves. . . Mr.
Potter."
Harry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr. Ollivander. He handed over his
wand.
"Aaaah, yes," said Mr. Ohlivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming. "Yes, yes,
yes. How well I remember."
Harry could remember too. He could remember it as though it had happened
yesterday....
Four summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had entered Mr. Ollivander's shop
with Hagrid to buy a wand. Mr. Ollivander had taken his measurements and then
started handing him wands to try. Harry had waved what felt like every wand in
the shop, until at last he had found the one that suited him - this one, which was
made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single feather from the tail of a
phoenix. Mr. Ollivander had been very surprised that Harry had been so
compatible with this wand. "Curious," he had said, "curious," and not until Harry
asked what was curious had Mr. Olhivander explained that the phoenix feather in
Harry's wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of Lord
Voldemort's.
Harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody. He was very fond
of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to Voldemort's wand was
something it couldn't help - rather as he couldn't help being related to Aunt
Petunia. However, he really hoped that Mr. Ollivander wasn't about to tell the
room about it. He had a funny feeling Rita Skeeter's Quick-Quotes Quill might just
explode with excitement if he did.
Mr. Ollivander spent much longer examining Harry's wand than anyone else's.
Eventually, however, he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it
back to Harry, announcing that it was still in perfect condition.
"Thank you all," said Dumbledore, standing up at the judges' table. "You may go
back to your lessons now - or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to
dinner, as they are about to end -"
Feeling that at last something had gone right today, Harry got up to leave, but the
man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat.
"Photos, Dumbledore, photos!" cried Bagman excitedly. "All the judges and
champions, what do you think, Rita?"
"Er - yes, let's do those first," said Rita Skeeter, whose eyes were upon Harry
again. "And then perhaps some individual shots."
The photographs took a long time. Madame Maxime cast everyone else into
shadow wherever she stood, and the photographer couldn't stand far enough back
202to get her into the frame; eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood
around her. Karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra
curl; Krum, whom Harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of
thing, skulked, half-hidden, at the back of the group. The photographer seemed
keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita Skeeter kept hurrying forward and
dragging Harry into greater prominence. Then she insisted on separate shots of all
the champions. At last, they were free to go.
Harry went down to dinner. Hermione wasn't there - he supposed she was still in
the hospital wing having her teeth fixed. He ate alone at the end of the table, then
returned to Gryffindor Tower, thinking of all the extra work on Summoning
Charms that he had to do. Up in the dormitory, he came across Ron.
"You've had an owl," said Ron brusquely the moment he walked in. He was
pointing at Harry's pillow. The school barn owl was waiting for him there.
"Oh - right," said Harry.
"And we've got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape's dungeon," said Ron.
He then walked straight out of the room, not looking at Harry. For a moment,
Harry considered going after him - he wasn't sure whether he wanted to talk to him
or hit him, both seemed quite appealing - but the lure of Sirius's answer was too
strong. Harry strode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg, and unrolled it.
Harry -
I can't say everything I would like to in a letter, it's too risky
in case the owl is intercepted - we need to talk face-to-face. Can you ensure that
you are alone by the fire in Gryffindor Tower at one o'clock in the morning on the
22nd ofNovember?
I know better than anyone that you can look after yourself and while you're around
Dumbledore and Moody I don't think anyone will be able to hurt you. However,
someone seems to be having a good try. Entering you in that tournament would
have been very risky, especially right under Dumbkdore's nose.
Be on the watch, Harry. I still want to hear about anything unusual. Let me know
about the 22nd ofNovember as quickly as you can.
Sirius
203CHAPTER NINETEEN - THE HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL
The prospect of talking face-to-face with Sirius was all that sustained Harry over
the next fortnight, the only bright spot on a horizon that had never looked darker.
The shock of finding himself school champion had worn off slightly now, and the
fear of what was facing him had started to sink in. The first task was drawing
steadily nearer; he felt as though it were crouching ahead of him hike some
horrific monster, barring his path. He had never suffered nerves like these; they
were way beyond anything he had experienced before a Quidditch match, not even
his last one against Slytherin, which had decided who would win the Quidditch
Cup. Harry was finding it hard to think about the future at all; he felt as though his
whole life had been heading up to, and would finish with, the first task.
Admittedly, he didn't see how Sirius was going to make him feel any better about
having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of
hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at
the moment. Harry wrote back to Sirius saying that he would be beside the
common room fire at the time Sirius had suggested; and he and Hermione spent a
long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the common room on
the night in question. If the worst came to the worst, they were going to drop a bag
of Dungbombs, but they hoped they wouldn't have to resort to that - Filch would
skin them alive.
In the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the confines of the
castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece about the Triwizard Tournament,
and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly
colored life story of Harry. Much of the front page had been given over to a
picture of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two, six, and seven) had been all
about Harry, the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions
(misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of the article, and Cedric hadn't
been mentioned at all.
The article had appeared ten days ago, and Harry still got a sick, burning feeling of
shame in his stomach every time he thought about it. Rita Skeeter had reported
him saying an awful lot of things that he couldn't remember ever saying in his life,
let alone in that broom cupboard.
I suppose I get my strength from my parents. I know they'd be very proud of me if
they could see me now. . . . Yes, sometimes at night I still cry about them, I'm not
ashamed to admit it. . . . I know nothing will hurt me during the tournament,
because they're watching over me. . .
But Rita Skeeter had gone even further than transforming his "er's" into long,
sickly sentences: She had interviewed other people about him too.
204Harry has at last found love at Hogwarts. His close friend, Colin Creevey, says
that Harry is rarely seen out of the company of one Hermione Granger, a
stunningly pretty Muggle-born girl who, like Harry, is one of the top students in
the school.
From the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to endure people --
Slytherins, mainly -- quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering
comments.
"Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?"
"Since when have you been one of the top students in the school, Potter? Or is this
a school you and Longbottom have set up together?"
"Hey - Harry!"
"Yeah, that's right!" Harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in the
corridor, having had just about enough. "I've just been crying my eyes out over my
dead mum, and I'm just off to do a bit more. . .
"No - it was just - you dropped your quill."
It was Cho. Harry felt the color rising in his face.
"Oh - right - sorry," he muttered, taking the quill back.
"Er. . . good luck on Tuesday," she said. "I really hope you do well."
Which left Harry feeling extremely stupid.
Hermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too, but she hadn't yet
started yelling at innocent bystanders; in fact, Harry was full of admiration for the
way she was handling the situation.
"Stunningly pretty? Her?" Pansy Parkinson had shrieked the first time she had
come face-to-face with Hermione after Rita's article had appeared. "What was she
judging against - a chipmunk?"
"Ignore it," Hermione said in a dignified voice, holding her head in the air and
stalking past the sniggering Slytherin girls as though she couldn't hear them. "Just
ignore it, Harry."
But Harry couldn't ignore it. Ron hadn't spoken to him at all since he had told him
about Snape's detentions. Harry had half hoped they would make things up during
the two hours they were forced to pickle rats' brains in Snape's dungeon, but that
had been the day Rita's article had appeared, which seemed to have confirmed
Ron's belief that Harry was really enjoying all the attention.
Hermione was furious with the pair of them; she went from one to the other, trying
to force them to talk to each other, but Harry was adamant: He would talk to Ron
again only if Ron admitted that Harry hadn't put his name in the Goblet of Fire and
205apologized for calling him a liar.
"I didn't start this," Harry said stubbornly. "It's his problem."
"You miss him!" Hermione said impatiently. "And I know he misses you -"
"Miss him?" said Harry. "I don't miss him. . .
But this was a downright lie. Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just wasn't
the same as Ron. There was much hess laughter and a lot more hanging around in
the library when Hermione was your best friend. Harry still hadn't mastered
Summoning Charms, he seemed to have developed something of a block about
them, and Hermione insisted that learning the theory would help. They
consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their lunchtimes.
Viktor Krum was in the library an awful lot too, and Harry wondered what he was
up to. Was he studying, or was he looking for things to help him through the first
task? Hermione often complained about Krum being there - not that he ever
bothered them - but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy on him
from behind bookshelves, and Hermione found the noise distracting.
"He's not even good-looking!" she muttered angrily, glaring at Krum's sharp
profile. "They only like him because he's famous! They wouldn't look twice at him
if he couldn't do that WonkyFaint thing -"
"Wronski Feint," said Harry, through gritted teeth. Quite apart from liking to get
Quidditch terms correct, it caused him another pang to imagine Ron's expression if
he could have heard Hermione talking about Wonky-Faints.
It is a strange thing, but when you are dreading something, and would give
anything to slow down time, it has a disobliging habit of speeding up. The days
until the first task seemed to slip by as though someone had fixed the clocks to
work at double speed. Harry's feeling of barely controlled panic was with him
wherever he went, as everpresent as the snide comments about the Daily Prophet
article.
On the Saturday before the first task, all students in the third year and above were
permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade. Hermione told Harry that it would do
him good to get away from the castle for a bit, and Harry didn't need much
persuasion.
"What about Ron, though?" he said. "Don't you want to go with him?"
"Oh. . . well.. ." Hermione went slightly pink. "I thought we might meet up with
him in the Three Broomsticks. . . ."
"No," said Harry flatly.
"Oh Harry, this is so stupid -"
206"I'll come, but I'm not meeting Ron, and I'm wearing my Invisibility Cloak."
"Oh all right then. . ." Hermione snapped, "but I hate talking to you in that cloak, I
never know if I'm looking at you or not."
So Harry put on his Invisibility Cloak in the dormitory, went back downstairs, and
together he and Hermione set off for Hogsmeade.
Harry felt wonderfully free under the cloak; he watched other students walking
past them as they entered the village, most of them sporting Support Cedric
Diggory! badges, but no horrible remarks came his way for a change, and nobody
was quoting that stupid article.
"People keep looking at me now," said Hermione grumpily as they came out of
Honeydukes Sweetshop later, eating large cream-filled chocolates. "They think I'm
talking to myself."
"Don't move your lips so much then."
"Come on, please just take off your cloak for a bit, no one's going to bother you
here."
"Oh yeah?" said Harry. "Look behind you."
Rita Skeeter and her photographer friend had just emerged from the Three
Broomsticks pub. Talking in low voices, they passed right by Hermione without
hooking at her. Harry backed into the wall of Honeydukes to stop Rita Skeeter
from hitting him with her crocodile-skin handbag. When they were gone, Harry
said, "She's staying in the village. I bet she's coming to watch the first task."
As he said it, his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic. He didn't mention
this; he and Hermione hadn't discussed what was coming in the first task much; he
had the feeling she didn't want to think about it.
"She's gone," said Hermione, looking right through Harry toward the end of the
street. "Why don't we go and have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks, it's a bit
cold, isn't it? You don't have to talk to Ron!" she added irritably, correctly
interpreting his silence.
The Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with Hogwarts students enjoying their
free afternoon, but also with a variety of magical people Harry rarely saw
anywhere else. Harry supposed that as Hogsmeade was the only all-wizard village
in Britain, it was a bit of a haven for creatures like hags, who were not as adept as
wizards at disguising themselves.
It was very hard to move through crowds in the Invisibility Cloak, in case you
accidentally trod on someone, which tended to lead to awkward questions. Harry
edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner while Hermione went to buy
drinks. On his way through the pub, Harry spotted Ron, who was sitting with Fred,
George, and Lee Jordan. Resisting the urge to give Ron a good hard poke in the
207back of the head, he finally reached the table and sat down at it.
Hermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butterbeer under his cloak.
"I look like such an idiot, sitting here on my own," she muttered. "Lucky I brought
something to do."
And she pulled out a notebook in which she had been keeping a record of
S.P.E.W. members. Harry saw his and Ron's names at the top of the very short list.
It seemed a long time ago that they had sat making up those predictions together,
and Hermione had turned up and appointed them secretary and treasurer.
"You know, maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved in
S.P.E.W.," Hermione said thoughtfully, looking around the pub.
"Yeah, right," said Harry. He took a swig of butterbeer under his cloak.
"Hermione, when are you going to give up on this spew stuff?"
"When house-elves have decent wages and working conditions!" she hissed back.
"You know, I'm starting to think it's time for more direct action. I wonder how you
get into the school kitchens?"
"No idea, ask Fred and George," said Harry.
Hermione lapsed into thoughtful silence, while Harry drank his butterbeer,
watching the people in the pub. All of them looked cheerful and relaxed. Ernie
Macmillan and Hannah Abbot were swapping Chocolate Frog cards at a nearby
table; both of them sporting Support Cedric Diggory! badges on their cloaks.
Right over by the door he saw Cho and a large group of her Ravenclaw friends.
She wasn't wearing a Cedric badge though. . . . This cheered up Harry very
slightly.
What wouldn't he have given to be one of these peophe, sitting around laughing
and talking, with nothing to worry about but homework? He imagined how it
would have felt to be here if his name hadn't come out of the Goblet of Fire. He
wouldn't be wearing the Invisibility Cloak, for one thing. Ron would be sitting
with him. The three of them would probably be happily imagining what deadly
dangerous task the school champions would be facing on Tuesday. He'd have been
really hooking forward to it, watching them do whatever it was...cheering on
Cedric with everyone else, safe in a seat at the back of the stands...
He wondered how the other champions were feeling. Every time he had seen
Cedric lately, he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but
excited. Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour from time to time in the corridors; she
looked exactly as she always did, haughty and unruffled. And Krum just sat in the
library, poring over books.
Harry thought of Sirius, and the tight, tense knot in his chest seemed to ease
slightly. He would be speaking to him in just over twelve hours, for tonight was
208the night they were meeting at the common room fire - assuming nothing went
wrong, as everything else had done lately...
"Look, it's Hagrid!" said Hermione.
The back of Hagrid's enormous shaggy head - he had mercifully abandoned his
bunches - emerged over the crowd. Harry wondered why he hadn't spotted him at
once, as Hagrid was so large, but standing up carefully, he saw that Hagrid had
been leaning low, talking to Professor Moody. Hagrid had his usual enormous
tankard in front of him, but Moody was drinking from his hip flask. Madam
Rosmerta, the pretty landlady, didn't seem to think much of this; she was looking
askance at Moody as she collected glasses from tables around them. Perhaps she
thought it was an insult to her mulled mead, but Harry knew better. Moody had
told them all during their last Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson that he
preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times, as it was so easy for Dark
wizards to poison an unattended cup.
As Harry watched, he saw Hagrid and Moody get up to leave. He waved, then
remembered that Hagrid couldn't see him. Moody, however, paused, his magical
eye on the corner where Harry was standing. He tapped Hagrid in the small of the
back (being unable to reach his shoulder), muttered something to him, and then the
pair of them made their way back across the pub toward Harry and Hermione's
table.
"All right, Hermione?" said Hagrid loudly.
"Hello," said Hermione, smiling back.
Moody limped around the table and bent down; Harry thought he was reading the
S.P.E.W. notebook, until he muttered, "Nice cloak, Potter."
Harry stared at him in amazement. The large chunk missing from Moody's nose
was particularly obvious at a few inches' distance. Moody grinned.
"Can your eye - I mean, can you - ?"
"Yeah, it can see through Invisibility Cloaks," Moody said quietly. "And it's come
in useful at times, I can tell you."
Hagrid was beaming down at Harry too. Harry knew Hagrid couldn't see him, but
Moody had obviously told Hagrid he was there. Hagrid now bent down on the
pretext of reading the S.P.E.W. notebook as well, and said in a whisper so low that
only Harry could hear it, "Harry, meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin. Wear
that cloak."
Straightening up, Hagrid said loudly, "Nice ter see yeh, Hermione," winked, and
departed. Moody followed him.
"Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight?" Harry said, very surprised.
209"Does he?" said Hermione, looking startled. "I wonder what he's up to? I don't
know whether you should go, Harry. . . ." She looked nervously around and
hissed, "It might make you late for Sirius."
It was true that going down to Hagrid's at midnight would mean cutting his
meeting with Sirius very fine indeed; Hermione suggested sending Hedwig down
to Hagrid's to tell him he couldn't go - always assuming she would consent to take
the note, of course - Harry, however, thought it better just to be quick at whatever
Hagrid wanted him for. He was very curious to know what this might be; Hagrid
had never asked Harry to visit him so late at night.
At half past eleven that evening, Harry, who had pretended to go up to bed early,
pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs through
the common room. Quite a few people were still in there. The Creevey brothers
had managed to get hold of a stack of Support Cedric Diggory! badges and were
trying to bewitch them to make them say Support Harry Potter! instead. So far,
however, all they had managed to do was get the badges stuck on POTTER
STINKS. Harry crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so,
keeping an eye on his watch. Then Hermione opened the Fat Lady for him from
outside as they had planned. He slipped past her with a whispered "Thanks!" and
set off through the castle.
The grounds were very dark. Harry walked down the lawn toward the lights
shining in Hagrid's cabin. The inside of the enormous Beauxbatons carriage was
also lit up; Harry could hear Madame Maxime talking inside it as he knocked on
Hagrid's front door.
"You there, Harry?" Hagrid whispered, opening the door and looking around.
"Yeah," said Harry, slipping inside the cabin and pulling the cloak down off his
head. "What's up?"
"Got summat ter show yeh," said Hagrid.
There was an air of enormous excitement about Hagrid. He was wearing a flower
that resembled an oversized artichoke in his buttonhole. It looked as though he had
abandoned the use of axle grease, but he had certainly attempted to comb his hair -
Harry could see the comb's broken teeth tangled in it.
"What're you showing me?" Harry said warily, wondering if the skrewts had laid
eggs, or Hagrid had managed to buy another giant three-headed dog off a stranger
in a pub.
"Come with me, keep quiet, an' keep yerself covered with that cloak," said Hagrid.
"We won' take Fang, he won' like it. . .
"Listen, Hagrid, I can't stay long. . . . I've got to be back up at the castle by one
o'clock -"
210But Hagrid wasn't listening; he was opening the cabin door and striding off into
the night. Harry hurried to follow and found, to his great surprise, that Hagrid was
leading him to the Beauxbatons carriage.
"Hagrid, what - ?"
"Shhh!" said Hagrid, and he knocked three times on the door bearing the crossed
golden wands.
Madame Maxime opened it. She was wearing a silk shawl wrapped around her
massive shoulders. She smiled when she saw Hagrid.
"Ah, 'Agrid . . . it is time?"
"Bong-sewer," said Hagrid, beaming at her, and holding out a hand to help her
down the golden steps.
Madame Maxime closed the door behind her, Hagrid offered her his arm, and they
set off around the edge of the paddock containing Madame Maxime's giant winged
horses, with Harry, totally bewildered, running to keep up with them. Had Hagrid
wanted to show him Madame Maxime? He could see her any old time he wanted..
. she wasn't exactly hard to miss....
But it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the same treat as Harry, because
after a while she said playfully, "Wair is it you are taking me, 'Agrid?"
"Yeh'll enjoy this," said Hagrid gruffly, "worth seein', trust me. On'y - don' go
tellin' anyone I showed yeh, right? Yeh're not s'posed ter know."
"Of course not," said Madame Maxime, fluttering her long black eyelashes.
And still they walked, Harry getting more and more irritated as he jogged along in
their wake, checking his watch every now and then. Hagrid had some harebrained
scheme in hand, which might make him miss Sirius. If they didn't get there soon,
he was going to turn around, go straight back to the castle, and leave Hagrid to
enjoy his moonlit stroll with Madame Maxime.
But then - when they had walked so far around the perimeter of the forest that the
castle and the lake were out of sight - Harry heard something. Men were shouting
up ahead. . . then came a deafening, earsplitting roar. . .
Hagrid led Madame Maxime around a clump of trees and came to a halt. Harry
hurried up alongside them - for a split second, he thought he was seeing bonfires,
and men darting around them - and then his mouth fell open.
Dragons.
Four fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons were rearing onto their hind
legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks of wood, roaring and snorting -
torrents of fire were shooting into the dark sky from their open, fanged mouths,
211fifty feet above the ground on their outstretched necks. There was a silvery-blue
one with long, pointed horns, snapping and snarling at the wizards on the ground;
a smooth-scaled green one, which was writhing and stamping with all its might; a
red one with an odd fringe of fine gold spikes around its face, which was shooting
mushroom-shaped fire clouds into the air; and a gigantic black one, more lizard-
hike than the others, which was nearest to them.
At least thirty wizards, seven or eight to each dragon, were attempting to control
them, pulling on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around their necks
and legs. Mesmerized, Harry looked up, high above him, and saw the eyes of the
black dragon, with vertical pupils like a cat's, bulging with either fear or rage, he
couldn't tell which. . . . It was making a horrible noise, a yowling, screeching
scream.
"Keep back there, Hagrid!" yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the chain
he was holding. "They can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet, you know! I've seen
this Horntail do forty!"
"Is'n' it beautiful?" said Hagrid softly.
"It's no good!" yelled another wizard. "Stunning Spells, on the count of three!"
Harry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand.
"Stupefy!" they shouted in unison, and the Stunning Spells shot into the darkness
like fiery rockets, bursting in showers of stars on the dragons' scaly hides -
Harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back legs; its
jaws stretched wide in a silent howl; its nostrils were suddenly devoid of flame,
though still smoking - then, very slowly, it fell. Several tons of sinewy, scaly-
black dragon hit the ground with a thud that Harry could have sworn made the
trees behind him quake.
The dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to their fallen
charges, each of which was the size of a small hill. They hurried to tighten the
chains and fasten them securely to iron pegs, which they forced deep into the
ground with their wands.
"Wan' a closer look?" Hagrid asked Madame Maxime excitedly. The pair of them
moved right up to the fence, and Harry followed. The wizard who had warned
Hagrid not to come any closer turned, and Harry realized who it was: Charlie
Weasley.
"All right, Hagrid?" he panted, coming over to talk. "They should be okay now -
we put them out with a Sleeping Draft on the way here, thought it might be better
for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet - but, like you saw, they weren't
happy, not happy at all -"
"What breeds you got here, Charlie?" said Hagrid, gazing at the closest dragon, the
212black one, with something chose to reverence. Its eyes were still just open. Harry
could see a strip of gleaming yellow beneath its wrinkled black eyelid.
"This is a Hungarian Horntail," said Charlie. "There's a Common Welsh Green
over there, the smaller one -- a Swedish Short-Snout, that blue-gray -- and a
Chinese Fireball, that's the red."
Charlie looked around; Madame Maxime was strolling away around the edge of
the enclosure, gazing at the stunned dragons.
"I didn't know you were bringing her, Hagrid," Charlie said, frowning. "The
champions aren't supposed to know what's coming - she's bound to tell her student,
isn't she?"
"Jus' thought she'd like ter see 'em," shrugged Hagrid, still gazing, enraptured, at
the dragons.
"Really romantic date, Hagrid," said Charlie, shaking his head.
"Four. . ." said Hagrid, "so it's one fer each o' the champions, is it? What've they
gotta do - fight 'em?"
"Just get past them, I think," said Charlie. "We'll be on hand if it gets nasty,
Extinguishing Spells at the ready. They wanted nesting mothers, I don't know
why. . . but I tell you this, I don't envy the one who gets the Horntail. Vicious
thing. Its back end's as dangerous as its front, look."
Charlie pointed toward the Horntail's tail, and Harry saw long, bronze-colored
spikes protruding along it every few inches.
Five of Charlie's fellow keepers staggered up to the Horntail at that moment,
carrying a clutch of huge granite-gray eggs between them in a blanket. They
placed them carefully at the Horntail's side. Hagrid let out a moan of longing.
"I've got them counted, Hagrid," said Charlie sternly. Then he said, "How's
Harry?"
"Fine," said Hagrid. He was still gazing at the eggs.
"Just hope he's still fine after he's faced this lot," said Charlie grimly, looking out
over the dragons' enclosure. "I didn't dare tell Mum what he's got to do for the first
task; she's already having kittens about him. . . ." Charlie imitated his mother's
anxious voice. "How could they let him enter that tournament, he's much too
young! I thought they were all safe, I thought there was going to be an age limit!'
She was in floods after that Daily Prophet article about him. 'He still cries about
his parents! Oh bless him, I never knew!"
Harry had had enough. Trusting to the fact that Hagrid wouldn't miss him, with the
attractions of four dragons and Madame Maxime to occupy him, he turned silently
and began to walk away, back to the castle.
213He didn't know whether he was glad he'd seen what was coming or not. Perhaps
this way was better. The first shock was over now. Maybe if he'd seen the dragons
for the first time on Tuesday, he would have passed out cold in front of the whole
school. . . but maybe he would anyway. .. . He was going to be armed with his
wand - which, just now, felt like nothing more than a narrow strip of wood --
against a fifty-foot-high, scaly, spike-ridden, fire-breathing dragon. And he had to
get past it. With everyone watching. How?
Harry sped up, skirting the edge of the forest; he had just under fifteen minutes to
get back to the fireside and talk to Sirius, and he couldn't remember, ever, wanting
to talk to someone more than he did right now -- when, without warning, he ran
into something very solid.
Harry fell backward, his glasses askew, clutching the cloak around him. A voice
nearby said, "Ouch! Who's there?"
Harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and hay very still, staring
up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit. He recognized the goatee. . . it was
Karkaroff.
"Who's there?" said Karkaroff again, very suspiciously, looking around in the
darkness. Harry remained still and silent. After a minute or so, Karkaroff seemed
to decide that he had hit some sort of animal; he was looking around at waist
height, as though expecting to see a dog. Then he crept back under the cover of the
trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the dragons were.
Very slowly and very carefully, Harry got to his feet and set off again as fast as he
could without making too much noise, hurrying through the darkness back toward
Hogwarts.
He had no doubt whatsoever what Karkaroff was up to. He had sneaked off his
ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be. He might even have
spotted Hagrid and Madame Maxime heading off around the forest together - they
were hardly difficult to spot at a distance. . . and now all Karkaroff had to do was
follow the sound of voices, and he, like Madame Maxime, would know what was
in store for the champions.
By the looks of it, the only champion who would be facing the unknown on
Tuesday was Cedric.
Harry reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors, and began to climb the
marble stairs; he was very out of breath, but he didn't dare slow down. . . . He had
less than five minutes to get up to the fire.
"Balderdash!" he gasped at the Fat Lady, who was snoozing in her frame in front
of the portrait hole.
"If you say so," she muttered sleepily, without opening her eyes, and the picture
swung forward to admit him. Harry climbed inside. The common room was
214deserted, and, judging by the fact that it smelled quite normal, Hermione had not
needed to set off any Dungbombs to ensure that he and Sirius got privacy.
Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw himself into an armchair in front
of the fire. The room was in semidarkness; the flames were the only source of
light. Nearby, on a table, the Support Cedric Diggory! badges the Creeveys had
been trying to improve were glinting in the firelight. They now read POTTER
REALLY STINKS. Harry looked back into the flames, and jumped.
Sirius's head was sitting in the fire. If Harry hadn't seen Mr. Diggory do exactly
this back in the Weasleys' kitchen, it would have scared him out of his wits.
Instead, his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days, he scrambled
out of his chair, crouched down by the hearth, and said, "Sirius - how're you
doing?"
Sirius looked different from Harry's memory of him. When they had said good-
bye, Sirius's face had been gaunt and sunken, surrounded by a quantity of long,
black, matted hair - but the hair was short and clean now, Sirius's face was fuller,
and he looked younger, much more like the only photograph Harry had of him,
which had been taken at the Potters' wedding.
"Never mind me, how are you?" said Sirius seriously.
"I'm -" For a second, Harry tried to say "fine" - but he couldn't do it. Before he
could stop himself, he was talking more than he'd talked in days - about how no
one believed he hadn't entered the tournament of his own free will, how Rita
Skeeter had lied about him in the Daily Prophet, how he couldn't walk down a
corridor without being sneered at - and about Ron, Ron not believing him, Ron's
jealousy...
". . . and now Hagrid's just shown me what's coming in the first task, and it's
dragons, Sirius, and I'm a goner," he finished desperately.
Sirius looked at him, eyes full of concern, eyes that had not yet lost the look that
Azkaban had given them - that deadened, haunted look He had let Harry talk
himself into silence without interruption, but now he said, "Dragons we can deal
with, Harry, but we'll get to that in a minute - I haven't got long here. . . I've
broken into a wizarding house to use the fire, but they could be back at any time.
There are things I need to warn you about."
"What?" said Harry, feeling his spirits slip a further few notches.. . . Surely there
could be nothing worse than dragons coming?
"Karkaroff," said Sirius. "Harry, he was a Death Eater. You know what Death
Eaters are, don't you?"
"Yes - he - what?"
"He was caught, he was in Azkaban with me, but he got released. I'd bet
215everything that's why Dumbledore wanted an Auror at Hogwarts this year - to
keep an eye on him. Moody caught Karkaroff. Put him into Azkaban in the first
place."
"Karkaroff got released?" Harry said slowly - his brain seemed to be struggling to
absorb yet another piece of shocking information. "Why did they release him?"
"He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic," said Sirius bitterly. "He said he'd seen
the error of his ways, and then he named names. . . he put a load of other people
into Azkaban in his place. . . . He's not very popular in there, I can tell you. And
since he got out, from what I can tell, he's been teaching the Dark Arts to every
student who passes through that school of his. So watch out for the Durmstrang
champion as well."
"Okay," said Harry slowly. "But. . . are you saying Karkaroff put my name in the
goblet? Because if he did, he's a really good actor. He seemed furious about it. He
wanted to stop me from competing."
"We know he's a good actor," said Sirius, "because he convinced the Ministry of
Magic to set him free, didn't he? Now, I've been keeping an eye on the Daily
Prophet, Harry.."
"- you and the rest of the world," said Harry bitterly.
"- and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman's article last month,
Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts. Yes, I know she says
it was another false alarm," Sirius said hastily, seeing Harry about to speak, "but I
don't think so, somehow. I think someone tried to stop him from getting to
Hogwarts. I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him
around. And no one's going to look into it too closely; Mad-Eye's heard intruders a
bit too often. But that doesn't mean he can't still spot the real thing. Moody was the
best Auror the Ministry ever had."
"So. . . what are you saying?" said Harry slowly. "Karkaroff's trying to kill me?
But - why?"
Sirius hesitated.
"I've been nearing some very strange things," he said slowly. "The Death Eaters
seem to be a bit more active than usual lately. They showed themselves at the
Quidditch World Cup, didn't they? Someone set off the Dark Mark.. . and then -
did you hear about that Ministry of Magic witch who's gone missing?"
"Bertha Jorkins?" said Harry.
"Exactly. . . she disappeared in Albania, and that's definitely where Voldemort was
rumored to be last. . . and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was
coming up, wouldn't she?"
"Yeah, but. . . it's not very likely she'd have walked straight into Voldemort, is it?"
216said Harry.
"Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins," said Sirius grimly. "She was at Hogwarts when I
was, a few years above your dad and me. And she was an idiot. Very nosy, but no
brains, none at all. It's not a good combination, Harry. I'd say she'd be very easy to
lure into a trap."
"So. . . so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament?" said Harry. "Is
that what you mean? You think Karkaroff might be here on his orders?"
"I don't know," said Sirius slowly, "I just don't know...Karkaroff doesn't strike me
as the type who'd go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was powerful
enough to protect him. But whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a
reason, and I can't help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to
attack you and make it hook like an accident."
"Looks hike a really good plan from where I'm standing," said Harry grinning
bleaky. "They'll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff."
"Right - these dragons," said Sirius, speaking very quickly now. "There's a way,
Harry. Don't be tempted to try a Stunning Spell - dragons are strong and too
powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need about half a
dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon -"
"Yeah, I know, I just saw," said Harry.
"But you can do it alone," said Sirius. "There is away, and a simple spell's all you
need. Just -"
But Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly pounding as though it
would burst. He could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind him.
"Go!" he hissed at Sirius. " Go! There's someone coming!"
Harry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire - if someone saw Sirius's face within
the walls of Hogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar - the Ministry would
get dragged in - he, Harry, would be questioned about Sirius's whereabouts -
Harry heard a tiny pop! in the fire behind him and knew Sirius had gone. He
watched the bottom of the spiral staircase. Who had decided to go for a stroll at
one o'clock in the morning, and stopped Sirius from telling him how to get past a
dragon?
It was Ron. Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas, Ron stopped dead facing
Harry across the room, and looked around.
"Who were you talking to?" he said.
"What's that got to do with you?" Harry snarled. "What are you doing down here
at this time of night?"
217"I just wondered where you -" Ron broke off, shrugging. "Nothing. I'm going back
to bed."
"Just thought you'd come nosing around, did you?" Harry shouted. He knew that
Ron had no idea what he'd walked in on, knew he hadn't done it on purpose, but he
didn't care - at this moment he hated everything about Ron, right down to the
several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trousers.
"Sorry about that," said Ron, his face reddening with anger. "Should've realized
you didn't want to be disturbed. I'll let you get on with practicing for your next
interview in peace."
Harry seized one of the POTTER REALLY STINKS badges off the table and
chucked it, as hard as he could, across the room. It hit Ron on the forehead and
bounced off.
"There you go," Harry said. "Something for you to wear on Tuesday. You might
even have a scar now, if yon're lucky.. . . That's what you want, isn't it?"
He strode across the room toward the stairs; he half expected Ron to stop him, he
would even have liked Ron to throw a punch at him, but Ron just stood there in his
too-small pajamas, and Harry, having stormed upstairs, lay awake in bed fuming
for a long time afterward and didn't hear him come up to bed.
218CHAPTER TWENTY - THE FIRST TASK
Harry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while
before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock.
When he'd finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body, he hurried off to
find Hermione, locating her at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, where she
was eating breakfast with Ginny. Feeling too queasy to eat, Harry waited until
Hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then dragged her out onto
the grounds. There, he told her all about the dragons, and about everything Sirius
had said, while they took another long walk around the lake.
Alarmed as she was by Sirius's warnings about Karkaroff, Hermione still thought
that the dragons were the more pressing problem.
"Let's just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening," she said desperately,
"and then we can worry about Karkaroff."
They walked three times around the lake, trying all the way to think of a simple
spell that would subdue a dragon. Nothing whatsoever occurred to them, so they
retired to the library instead. Here, Harry pulled down every book he could find on
dragons, and both of them set to work searching through the large pile.
"Talon-clipping by charms. .. treating scale-rot. . .' This is no good, this is for
nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them healthy. ..
"Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the ancient magic that imbues
their thick hides, which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate. . .' But
Sirius said a simple one would do it.. .
"Let's try some simple spellbooks, then," said Harry, throwing aside Men Who
Love Dragons Too Much.
He returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks, set them down, and began to
flick through each in turn, Hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow.
"Well, there are Switching Spells. . . but what's the point of Switching it? Unless
you swapped its fangs for wine-gums or something that would make it less
dangerous.. . . The trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get through
a dragon's hide. . . . I'd say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really
haven't got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall. . . unless you're supposed
to put the spell on yourself? Maybe to give yourself extra powers? But they're not
simple spells, I mean, we haven't done any of those in class, I only know about
them because I've been doing O.W.L. practice papers. . . ."
"Hermione," Harry said, through gritted teeth, "will you shut up for a bit, please? I
m trying to concentrate."
219But all that happened, when Hermione fell silent, was that Harry's brain filled with
a sort of blank buzzing, which didn't seem to allow room for concentration. He
stared hopelessly down the index of Basic Hexes for the Busy and Vexed. Instant
scalping. . . but dragons had no hair. . . pepper breath.. . that would probably
increase a dragon's firepower. . . horn tongue. . . just what he needed, to give it an
extra weapon...
"Oh no, he's back again, why can't he read on his stupid ship?" said Hermione
irritably as Viktor Krum slouched in, cast a surly look over at the pair of them, and
settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books. "Come on, Harry, we'll go
back to the common room. . . his fan club'll be here in a moment, twittering
away... ."
And sure enough, as they left the library, a gang of girls tiptoed past them, one of
them wearing a Bulgaria scarf tied around her waist.
Harry barely slept that night. When he awoke on Monday morning, he seriously
considered for the first time ever just running away from Hogwarts. But as he
looked around the Great Hall at breakfast time, and thought about what leaving the
castle would mean, he knew he couldn't do it. It was the only place he had ever
been happy. . . well, he supposed he must have been happy with his parents too,
but he couldn't remember that.
Somehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than
back on Privet Drive with Dudley was good to know; it made him feel slightly
calmer. He finished his bacon with difficulty (his throat wasn't working too well),
and as he and Hermione got up, he saw Cedric Diggory leaving the Hufflepuff
table.
Cedric still didn't know about the dragons. . . the only champion who didn't, if
Harry was right in thinking that Maxime and Karkaroff would have told Fleur and
Krum....
"Hermione, I'll see you in the greenhouses," Harry said, coming to his decision as
he watched Cedric leaving the Hall. "Go on, I'll catch you up."
"Harry, you'll be late, the bell's about to ring -"
"I'll catch you up, okay?"
By the time Harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase, Cedric was at the
top. He was with a load of sixth-year friends. Harry didn't want to talk to Cedric in
front of them; they were among those who had been quoting Rita Skeeter's article
at him every time he went near them. He followed Cedric at a distance and saw
that he was heading toward the Charms corridor. This gave Harry an idea. Pausing
at a distance from them, he pulled out his wand, and took careful aim.
"Diffindo!"
220Cedric's bag split. Parchment, quills, and books spilled out of it onto the floor.
Several bottles of ink smashed.
"Don't bother," said Cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to
help him. "Tell Flitwick I'm coming, go on. . .
This was exactly what Harry had been hoping for. He slipped his wand back into
his robes, waited until Cedric's friends had disappeared into their classroom, and
hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of everyone but himself and Cedric.
"Hi," said Cedric, picking up a copy of A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration that
was now splattered with ink. "My bag just split. . . brand-new and all. . ."
"Cedric," said Harry, "the first task is dragons."
"What?" said Cedric, looking up.
"Dragons," said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick came out to
see where Cedric had got to. "They've got four, one for each of us, and we've got
to get past them."
Cedric stared at him. Harry saw some of the panic he'd been feeling since Saturday
night flickering in Cedric's gray eyes.
"Are you sure?" Cedric said in a hushed voice.
"Dead sure," said Harry. "I've seen them."
"But how did you find out? We're not supposed to know. . . ."
"Never mind," said Harry quickly - he knew Hagrid would be in trouble if he told
the truth. "But I'm not the only one who knows. Fleur and Krum will know by now
- Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons too."
Cedric straightened up, his arms full of inky quills, parchment, and books, his
ripped bag dangling off one shoulder. He stared at Harry, and there was a puzzled,
almost suspicious look in his eyes.
"Why are you telling me?" he asked.
Harry looked at him in disbelief. He was sure Cedric wouldn't have asked that if
he had seen the dragons himself. Harry wouldn't have let his worst enemy face
those monsters unprepared - well, perhaps Malfoy or Snape...
"It's just . . . fair, isn't it?" he said to Cedric. "We all know now. . . we're on an
even footing, aren't we?"
Cedric was still hooking at him in a slightly suspicious way when Harry heard a
familiar clunking noise behind him. He turned around and saw Mad-Eye Moody
emerging from a nearby classroom.
221"Come with me, Potter," he growled. "Diggory, off you go."
Harry stared apprehensively at Moody. Had he overheard them?
"Er - Professor, I'm supposed to be in Herbology -"
"Never mind that, Potter. In my office, please...
Harry followed him, wondering what was going to happen to him now. What if
Moody wanted to know how he'd found out about the dragons? Would Moody go
to Dumbledore and tell on Hagrid, or just turn Harry into a ferret? Well, it might
be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret, Harry thought dully, he'd be
smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet..
He followed Moody into his office. Moody closed the door behind them and
turned to look at Harry, his magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one.
"That was a very decent thing you just did, Potter," Moody said quietly.
Harry didn't know what to say; this wasn't the reaction he had expected at all.
"Sit down," said Moody, and Harry sat, looking around.
He had visited this office under two of its previous occupants. In Professor
Lockhart's day, the walls had been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of
Professor Lockhart himself. When Lupin had lived here, you were more likely to
come across a specimen of some fascinating new Dark creature he had procured
for them to study in class. Now, however, the office was full of a number of
exceptionally odd objects that Harry supposed Moody had used in the days when
he had been an Auror.
On his desk stood what looked hike a large, cracked, glass spinning top; Harry
recognized it at once as a Sneakoscope, because he owned one himself, though it
was much smaller than Moody's. In the corner on a small table stood an object that
looked something like an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial. It was humming
slightly. What appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry on the wall, but it was
not reflecting the room. Shadowy figures were moving around inside it, none of
them clearly in focus.
"Like my Dark Detectors, do you?" s aid Moody, who was watching Harry
closely.
"What's that?" Harry asked, pointing at the squiggly golden aerial.
"Secrecy Sensor. Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies.. . no use here, of
course, too much interference - students in every direction lying about why they
haven't done their homework Been humming ever since I got here. I had to disable
my Sneakoscope because it wouldn't stop whistling. It's extra-sensitive, picks up
stuff about a mile around. Of course, it could be picking up more than kid stuff,"
he added in a growl.
222"And what's the mirror for?"
"Oh that's my Foe-Glass. See them out there, skulking around? I'm not really in
trouble until I see the whites of their eyes. That's when I open my trunk."
He let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the large trunk under the window. It
had seven keyholes in a row. Harry wondered what was in there, until Moody's
next question brought him sharply back to earth.
"So. . . found out about the dragons, have you?"
Harry hesitated. He'd been afraid of this - but he hadn't told Cedric, and he
certainly wasn't going to tell Moody, that Hagrid had broken the rules.
"It's all right," said Moody, sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with a
groan. "Cheating's a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has
been."
"I didn't cheat," said Harry sharply. "It was - a sort of accident that I found out."
Moody grinned. "I wasn't accusing you, laddie. I've been telling Dumbledore from
the start, he can be as high-minded as he likes, but you can bet old Karkaroff and
Maxime won't be. They'll have told their champions everything they can. They
want to win. They want to beat Dumbledore. They'd like to prove he's only
human."
Moody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye swiveled around so fast it
made Harry feel queasy to watch it.
"So. . . got any ideas how you're going to get past your dragon yet?" said Moody.
"No," said Harry.
"Well, I'm not going to tell you," said Moody gruffly. "I don't show favoritism,
me. I'm just going to give you some good, general advice. And the first bit is - play
to your strengths."
"I haven't got any," said Harry, before he could stop himself. "Excuse me,"
growled Moody, "you've got strengths if I say you've got them. Think now. What
are you best at?"
Harry tried to concentrate. What was he best at? Well, that was easy, really --
"Quidditch," he said dully, "and a fat lot of help -"
"That's right," said Moody, staring at him very hard, his magical eye barely
moving at all. "You're a damn good flier from what I've heard."
"Yeah, but.. ." Harry stared at him. "I'm not allowed a broom, I've only got my
wand..."
223"My second piece of general advice," said Moody loudly, interrupting him, "is to
use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to get what you need."
Harry looked at him blankly. What did he need?
"Come on, boy. . ." whispered Moody. "Put them together... it's not that
difficult..."
And it clicked. He was best at flying. He needed to pass the dragon in the air. For
that, he needed his Firebolt. And for his Fire-bolt, he needed -
"Hermione," Harry whispered, when he had sped into greenhouse three minutes
later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout as he passed her. "Hermione -
I need you to help me."
"What d'you think I've been trying to do, Harry?" she whispered back, her eyes
round with anxiety over the top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was pruning.
"Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by tomorrow
afternoon."
And so they practiced. They didn't have lunch, but headed for a free classroom,
where Harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room
toward him. He was still having problems. The books and quills kept losing heart
halfway across the room and dropping hike stones to the floor.
"Concentrate, Harry, concentrate. . . ."
"What d'you think I'm trying to do?" said Harry angrily. "A great big dragon keeps
popping up in my head for some reason...Okay, try again. . . ."
He wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but Hermione refused point-
blank to skive off Arithmancy, and there was no point in staying without her. He
therefore had to endure over an hour of Professor Trelawney, who spent half the
lesson telling everyone that the position of Mars with relation to Saturn at that
moment meant that people born in July were in great danger of sudden, violent
deaths.
"Well, that's good," said Harry loudly, his temper getting the better of him, "just as
long as it's not drawn-out. I don't want to suffer."
Ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh; he certainly caught
Harry's eye for the first time in days, but Harry was still feeling too resentful
toward Ron to care. He spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects
toward him under the table with his wand. He managed to make a fly zoom
straight into his hand, though he wasn't entirely sure that was his prowess at
Summoning Charms - perhaps the fly was just stupid.
He forced down some dinner after Divination, then returned to the empty
classroom with Hermione, using the Invisibility Cloak to avoid the teachers. They
224kept practicing until past midnight. They would have stayed longer, but Peeves
turned up and, pretending to think that Harry wanted things thrown at him, started
chucking chairs across the room. Harry and Hermione left in a hurry before the
noise attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor common room, which was
now mercifully empty.
At two o'clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded by heaps
of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of Gobstones, and
Neville's toad, Trevor. Only in the last hour had Harry really got the hang of the
Summoning Charm.
"That's better, Harry, that's loads better," Hermione said, looking exhausted but
very pleased.
"Well, now we know what to do next time I can't manage a spell," Harry said,
throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again, "threaten me
with a dragon. Right..." He raised his wand once more. "Accio Dictionary!"
The heavy book soared out of Hermione's hand, flew across the room, and Harry
caught it.
"Harry, I really think you've got it!" said Hermione delightedly.
"Just as long as it works tomorrow," Harry said. "The Firebolt's going to be much
farther away than the stuff in here, it's going to be in the castle, and I'm going to be
out there on the grounds. . . ."
"That doesn't matter," said Hermione firmly." Just as long as you're concentrating
really, really hard on it, it'll come. Harry, we'd better get some sleep.. . you're
going to need it."
Harry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning Charm that evening
that some of his blind panic had heft him. It returned in full measure, however, on
the following morning. The atmosphere in the school was one of great tension and
excitement. Lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the students time to get
down to the dragons' enclosure - though of course, they didn't yet know what they
would find there.
Harry felt oddly separate from everyone around him, whether they were wishing
him good luck or hissing "We'll have a box of tissues ready, Potter" as he passed.
It was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he mightn't
just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon, and start trying to
curse everyone in sight. Time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever,
rushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he seemed to be sitting down in
his first lesson, History of Magic, and the next, walking into lunch.. . and then
(where had the morning gone? the last of the dragon-free hours?), Professor
McGonagall was hurrying over to him in the Great Hall. Lots of people were
watching.
225"Potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds now... . You have to
get ready for your first task."
"Okay," said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter.
"Good luck, Harry," Hermione whispered. "You'll be fine!"
"Yeah," said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his own.
He heft the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall. She didn't seem herself either;
in fact, she looked nearly as anxious as Hermione. As she walked him down the
stone steps and out into the cold November afternoon, she put her hand on his
shoulder.
"Now, don't panic," she said, "just keep a cool head. . . . We've got wizards
standing by to control the situation if it gets out of hand. . . . The main thing is just
to do your best, and nobody will think any the worse of you. . . . Are you all
right?"
"Yes," Harry heard himself say. "Yes, I'm fine."
She was leading him toward the place where the dragons were, around the edge of
the forest, but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the
enclosure would be clearly visible, Harry saw that a tent had been erected, its
entrance facing them, screening the dragons from view.
"You're to go in here with the other champions," said Professor McGonagall, in a
rather shaky sort of voice, "and wait for your turn, Potter. Mr. Bagman is in there.
. . he'll be telling you the - the procedure. . . . Good luck."
"Thanks," said Harry, in a flat, distant voice. She left him at the entrance of the
tent. Harry went inside.
Fleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a how wooden stool. She didn't look
nearly as composed as usual, but rather pale and clammy. Viktor Krum looked
even surlier than usual, which Harry supposed was his way of showing nerves.
Cedric was pacing up and down. When Harry entered, Cedric gave him a small
smile, which Harry returned, feeling the muscles in his face working rather hard,
as though they had forgotten how to do it.
"Harry! Good-o!" said Bagman happily, looking around at him. "Come in, come
in, make yourself at home!"
Bagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure, standing amid
all the pale-faced champions. He was wearing his old Wasp robes again.
"Well, now we're all here - time to fill you in!" said Bagman brightly. "When the
audience has assembled, I'm going to be offering each of you this bag" - he held
up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at them - "from which you will each
select a small model of the thing you are about to face! There are different - er -
226varieties, you see. And I have to tell you something else too.. . ah, yes... your task
is to collect the golden egg!"
Harry glanced around. Cedric had nodded once, to show that he understood
Bagman's words, and then started pacing around the tent again; he looked slightly
green. Fleur Delacour and Krum hadn't reacted at all. Perhaps they thought they
might be sick if they opened their mouths; that was certainly how Harry felt. But
they, at least, had volunteered for this. .
And in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard
passing the tent, their owners talking excitedly, laughing, joking. . . . Harry felt as
separate from the crowd as though they were a different species. And then - it
seemed like about a second later to Harry - Bagman was opening the neck of the
purple silk sack.
"Ladies first," he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour.
She put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny, perfect model of a
dragon - a Welsh Green. It had the number two around its neck And Harry knew,
by the fact that Fleur showed no sign of surprise, but rather a determined
resignation, that he had been right: Madame Maxime had told her what was
coming.
The same held true for Krum. He pulled out the scarlet Chinese Fireball. It had a
number three around its neck. He didn't even blink, just sat back down and stared
at the ground.
Cedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the blueish-gray Swedish Short-
Snout, the number one tied around its neck. Knowing what was left, Harry put his
hand into the silk bag and pulled out the Hungarian Horntail, and the number four.
It stretched its wings as he looked down at it, and bared its minuscule fangs.
"Well, there you are!" said Bagman. "You have each pulled out the dragon you
will face, and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the
dragons, do you see? Now, I'm going to have to leave you in a moment, because
I'm commentating. Mr. Diggory, you're first, just go out into the enclosure when
you hear a whistle, all right? Now. . . Harry. . . could I have a quick word?
Outside?"
"Er. . . yes," said Harry blankly, and he got up and went out of the tent with
Bagman, who walked him a short distance away, into the trees, and then turned to
him with a fatherly expression on his face.
"Feeling all right, Harry? Anything I can get you?"
"What?" said Harry. "I - no, nothing."
"Got a plan?" said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially. "Because I don't
mind sharing a few pointers, if you'd like them, you know. I mean," Bagman
227continued, lowering his voice still further, "you're the underdog here, Harry. . . .
Anything I can do to help. . ."
"No," said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude, "no - I - I know what
I'm going to do, thanks."
"Nobody would know, Harry," said Bagman, winking at him.
"No, I'm fine," said Harry, wondering why he kept telling people this, and
wondering whether he had ever been less fine. "I've got a plan worked out, I -"
A whistle had blown somewhere.
"Good lord, I've got to run!" said Bagman in alarm, and he hurried off.
Harry walked back to the tent and saw Cedric emerging from it, greener than ever.
Harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past, but all that came out of his mouth
was a sort of hoarse grunt.
Harry went back inside to Fleur and Krum. Seconds hater, they heard the roar of
the crowd, which meant Cedric had entered the enclosure and was now face-to-
face with the living counterpart of his model.
It was worse than Harry could ever have imagined, sitting there and listening. The
crowd screamed. . . yelled.. . gasped like a single many-headed entity, as Cedric
did whatever he was doing to get past the Swedish Short-Snout. Krum was still
staring at the ground. Fleur had now taken to retracing Cedric's steps, around and
around the tent. And Bagman's commentary made everything much, much worse..
. . Horrible pictures formed in Harry's mind as he heard: "Oooh, narrow miss
there, very narrow". . . "He's taking risks, this one!". . . "Clever move - pity it
didn't work!"
And then, after about fifteen minutes, Harry heard the deafening roar that could
mean only one thing: Cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the golden
egg.
"Very good indeed!" Bagman was shouting. "And now the marks from the
judges!"
But he didn't shout out the marks; Harry supposed the judges were holding them
up and showing them to the crowd.
"One down, three to go!" Bagman yelled as the whistle blew again. "Miss
Delacour, if you please!"
Fleur was trembling from head to foot; Harry felt more warmly toward her than he
had done so far as she heft the tent with her head held high and her hand clutching
her wand. He and Krum were left alone, at opposite sides of the tent, avoiding
each other's gaze.
228The same process started again. . . ."Oh I'm not sure that was wise!" they could
hear Bagman shouting gleefully. "Oh. . . nearly! Careful now. . . good lord, I
thought she'd had it then!"
Ten minutes later, Harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once more. . . . Fleur
must have been successful too. A pause, while Fleur's marks were being shown. . .
more clapping.. . then, for the third time, the whistle.
"And here comes Mr. Krum!" cried Bagman, and Krum slouched out, leaving
Harry quite alone.
He felt much more aware of his body than usual; very aware of the way his heart
was pumping fast, and his fingers tingling with fear. . . yet at the same time, he
seemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing the crowd,
as though from far away.
"Very daring!" Bagman was yelling, and Harry heard the Chinese Fireball emit a
horrible, roaring shriek, while the crowd drew its collective breath. "That's some
nerve he's showing - and - yes, he's got the egg!"
Applause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass; Krum had finished - it
would be Harry's turn any moment.
He stood up, noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallow. He
waited. And then he heard the whistle blow. He walked out through the entrance
of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside him. And now he was walking
past the trees, through a gap in the enclosure fence.
He saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored dream.
There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that
had been magicked there since he'd last stood on this spot. And there was the
Horntail, at the other end of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of eggs,
her wings half-furled, her evil, yellow eyes upon him, a monstrous, scaly, black
lizard, thrashing her spiked tail, heaving yard-long gouge marks in the hard
ground. The crowd was making a great deal of noise, but whether friendly or not,
Harry didn't know or care. It was time to do what he had to do. . . to focus his
mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that was his only chance.
He raised his wand.
"Accio Firebolt!" he shouted.
Harry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying. . . . If it hadn't worked. . . if it
wasn't coming. . . He seemed to be looking at everything around him through
some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the
enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely....
And then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he turned and saw his
Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods, soaring into the
229enclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside him, waiting for him to mount. The
crowd was making even more noise. . . . Bagman was shouting something. . . but
Harry's ears were not working properly anymore. . . listening wasn't important....
He swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground. And a second
later, something miraculous happened....
As he soared upward, as the wind rushed through his hair, as the crowd's faces
became mere flesh-colored pinpnicks below, and the Horntail shrank to the size of
a dog, he realized that he had heft not only the ground behind, but also his fear. . . .
He was back where he belonged....
This was just another Quidditch match, that was all. . . just another Quidditch
match, and that Horntail was just another ugly opposing team.
He looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one, gleaming against
its cement-colored fellows, residing safely between the dragon's front legs.
"Okay," Harry told himself, "diversionary tactics. . . let's go. . ."
He dived. The Horntail's head followed him; he knew what it was going to do and
pulled out of the dive just in time; a jet of fire had been released exactly where he
would have been had he not swerved away. . . but Harry didn't care.. . that was no
more than dodging a Bludger.
"Great Scott, he can fly!" yelled Bagman as the crowd shrieked and gasped. "Are
you watching this, Mr. Krum?"
Harry soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still following his progress; its
head revolving on its long neck - if he kept this up, it would be nicely dizzy - but
better not push it too long, or it would be breathing fire again -
Harry plummeted just as the Horntail opened its mouth, but this time he was less
lucky - he missed the flames, but the tail came whipping up to meet him instead,
and as he swerved to the left, one of the long spikes grazed his shoulder, ripping
his robes --
He could feel it stinging, he could hear screaming and groans from the crowd, but
the cut didn't seem to be deep. . . . Now he zoomed around the back of the
Horntail, and a possibility occurred to him....
The Horntail didn't seem to want to take off, she was too protective of her eggs.
Though she writhed and twisted, furling and unfurling her wings and keeping
those fearsome yellow eyes on Harry, she was afraid to move too far from them. . .
but he had to persuade her to do it, or he'd never get near them. . . . The trick was
to do it carefully, gradually....
He began to fly, first this way, then the other, not near enough to make her breathe
fire to stave him off, but still posing a sufficient threat to ensure she kept her eyes
on him. Her head swayed this way and that, watching him out of those vertical
230pupils, her fangs bared...
He flew higher. The Horntail's head rose with him, her neck now stretched to its
fullest extent, still swaying, hike a snake before its charmer. . .
Harry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of exasperation. He was like a
fly to her, a fly she was longing to swat; her tail thrashed again, but he was too
high to reach now. . . . She shot fire into the air, which he dodged.. . . Her jaws
opened wide....
"Come on," Harry hissed, swerving tantalizingly above her, "come on, come and
get me. . . up you get now. ."
And then she reared, spreading her great, black, leathery wings at last, as wide as
those of a small airplane - and Harry dived. Before the dragon knew what he had
done, or where he had disappeared to, he was speeding toward the ground as fast
as he could go, toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed front legs - he had
taken his hands off his Firebolt - he had seized the golden egg -
And with a huge spurt of speed, he was off, he was soaring out over the stands, the
heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm, and it was as though somebody had just
turned the volume back up - for the first time, he became properly aware of the
noise of the crowd, which was screaming and applauding as loudly as the Irish
supporters at the World Cup -
"Look at that!" Bagman was yelling. "Will you look at that! Our youngest
champion is quickest to get his egg! Well, this is going to shorten the odds on Mr.
Potter!"
Harry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the Horntail, and, over at
the entrance to the enclosure, Professor McGonagalh, Professor Moody, and
Hagrid hurrying to meet him, all of them waving him toward them, their smiles
evident even from this distance. He flew back over the stands, the noise of the
crowd pounding his eardrums, and came in smoothly to land, his heart lighter than
it had been in weeks. . . . He had got through the first task, he had survived.
"That was excellent, Potter!" cried Professor McGonagall as he got off the Firebolt
- which from her was extravagant praise. He noticed that her hand shook as she
pointed at his shoulder. "You'll need to see Madam Pomfrey before the judges
give out your score. . . . Over there, she's had to mop up Diggory already. . . ."
"Yeh did it, Harry!" said Hagrid hoarsely. "Yeh did it! An' agains' the Horntail an'
all, an' yeh know Charlie said that was the wors' - "
"Thanks, Hagrid," said Harry loudly, so that Hagrid wouldn't blunder on and
reveal that he had shown Harry the dragons beforehand.
Professor Moody looked very pleased too; his magical eye was dancing in its
socket.
231"Nice and easy does the trick, Potter," he growled.
"Right then, Potter, the first aid tent, please. . ." said Professor McGonagall.
Harry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw Madam Pomfrey
standing at the mouth of a second tent, looking worried.
"Dragons!" she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling Harry inside. The tent was
divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric's shadow through the canvas, but
Cedric didn't seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey
examined Harry's shoulder, talking furiously all the while. "Last year dementors,
this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next? You're very
lucky. . . this is quite shallow. . . it'll need cleaning before I heal it up, though... ."
She cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung, but
then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.
"Now, just sit quietly for a minute - sit! And then you can go and get your score."
She bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say, "How does it
feel now, Diggory?"
Harry didn't want to sit still: He was too full of adrenaline. He got to his feet,
wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he'd reached the mouth of
the tent, two people had come darting inside - Hermione, followed closely by Ron.
"Harry, you were brilliant!" Hermione said squeakily. There were fingernail marks
on her face where she had been clutching it in fear. "You were amazing! You
really were!"
But Harry was looking at Ron, who was very white and staring at Harry as though
he were a ghost.
"Harry," he said, very seriously, "whoever put your name in that goblet - I - I
reckon they're trying to do you in!"
It was as though the last few weeks had never happened - as though Harry were
meeting Ron for the first time, right after he'd been made champion.
"Caught on, have you?" said Harry coldly. "Took you long enough."
Hermione stood nervously between them, looking from one to the other. Ron
opened his mouth uncertainly. Harry knew Ron was about to apologize and
suddenly he found he didn't need to hear it.
"It's okay," he said, before Ron could get the words out. "Forget it."
"No," said Ron, "I shouldn't've -"
"Forget it, "Harry said.
232Ron grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned back
Hermione burst into tears.
"There's nothing to cry about!" Harry told her, bewildered.
"You two are so stupid!" she shouted, stamping her foot on the ground, tears
splashing down her front. Then, before either of them could stop her, she had
given both of them a hug and dashed away, now positively howling.
"Barking mad," said Ron, shaking his head. "Harry, c'mon, they'll be putting up
your scores. . . ."
Picking up the golden egg and his Firebolt, feeling more elated than he would
have believed possible an hour ago, Harry ducked out of the tent, Ron by his side,
talking fast.
"You were the best, you know, no competition. Cedric did this weird thing where
he Transfigured a rock on the ground. . . turned it into a dog. . . he was trying to
make the dragon go for the dog instead of him. Well, it was a pretty cool bit of
Transfiguration, and it sort of worked, because he did get the egg, but he got
burned as well - the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it
would rather have him than the Labrador; he only just got away. And that Fleur
girl tried this sort of charm, I think she was trying to put it into a trance - well, that
kind of worked too, it went all sleepy, but then it snored, and this great jet of flame
shot out, and her skirt caught fire - she put it out with a bit of water out of her
wand. And Krum - you won't believe this, but he didn't even think of flying! He
was probably the best after you, though. Hit it with some sort of spell right in the
eye. Only thing is, it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real
eggs - they took marks off for that, he wasn't supposed to do any damage to them."
Ron drew breath as he and Harry reached the edge of the enclosure. Now that the
Horntail had been taken away, Harry could see where the five judges were sitting -
right at the other end, in raised seats draped in gold.
"It's marks out of ten from each one," Ron said, and Harry squinting up the field,
saw the first judge - Madame Maxime - raise her wand in the air. What hooked
like a long silver ribbon shot out of it, which twisted itself into a large figure eight.
"Not bad!" said Ron as the crowd applauded. "I suppose she took marks off for
your shoulder. . .
Mr. Crouch came next. He shot a number nine into the air.
"Looking good!" Ron yelled, thumping Harry on the back.
Next, Dumbledore. He too put up a nine. The crowd was cheering harder than
ever.
Ludo Bagman - ten.
233"Ten?" said Harry in disbelief. "But. . . I got hurt. . . . What's he playing at?"
"Harry, don't complain!" Ron yelled excitedly.
And now Karkaroff raised his wand. He paused for a moment, and then a number
shot out of his wand too - four.
"What?" Ron bellowed furiously. "Four? You lousy, biased scum-bag, you gave
Krum ten!"
But Harry didn't care, he wouldn't have cared if Karkaroff had given him zero;
Ron's indignation on his behalf was worth about a hundred points to him. He didn't
tell Ron this, of course, but his heart felt lighter than air as he turned to leave the
enclosure. And it wasn't just Ron. . . those weren't only Gryffindors cheering in the
crowd. When it had come to it, when they had seen what he was facing, most of
the school had been on his side as well as Cedric's. . . . He didn't care about the
Slytherins, he could stand whatever they threw at him now.
"You're tied in first place, Harry! You and Krum!" said Charlie Weasley, hurrying
to meet them as they set off back toward the school. "Listen, I've got to run, I've
got to go and send Mum an owl, I swore I'd tell her what happened - but that was
unbelievable! Oh yeah - and they told me to tell you you've got to hang around for
a few more minutes.. . . Bagman wants a word, back in the champions' tent."
Ron said he would wait, so Harry reentered the tent, which somehow looked quite
different now: friendly and welcoming. He thought back to how he'd felt while
dodging the Horntail, and compared it to the long wait before he'd walked out to
face it.... There was no comparison; the wait had been immeasurably worse.
Fleur, Cedric, and Krum all came in together. One side of Cedric's face was
covered in a thick orange paste, which was presumably mending his burn. He
grinned at Harry when he saw him.
"Good one, Harry."
"And you," said Harry, grinning back.
"Well done, all of you!" said Ludo Bagman, bouncing into the tent and looking as
pleased as though he personally had just got past a dragon. "Now, just a quick few
words. You've got a nice long break before the second task, which will take place
at half past nine on the morning of February the twenty-fourth - but we're giving
you something to think about in the meantime! If you look down at those golden
eggs you're all holding, you will see that they open. . . see the hinges there? You
need to solve the clue inside the egg - because it will tell you what the second task
is, and enable you to prepare for it! All clear? Sure? Well, off you go, then!"
Harry left the tent, rejoined Ron, and they started to walk back around the edge of
the forest, talking hard; Harry wanted to hear what the other champions had done
in more detail. Then, as they rounded the clump of trees behind which Harry had
234first heard the dragons roar, a witch leapt out from behind them.
It was Rita Skeeter. She was wearing acid-green robes today; the Quick-Quotes
Quill in her hand blended perfectly against them.
"Congratulations, Harry!" she said, beaming at him. "I wonder if you could give
me a quick word? How you felt facing that dragon? How you feel now, about the
fairness of the scoring?"
"Yeah, you can have a word," said Harry savagely. "Good-bye."
And he set off back to the castle with Ron.
235CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE - THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT
Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that evening to find Pigwidgeon,
so that Harry could send Sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past
his dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry filled Ron in on everything Sirius had
told him about Karkaroff. Though shocked at first to hear that Karkaroff had been
a Death Eater, by the time they entered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought
to have suspected it all along.
"Fits, doesn't it?" he said. "Remember what Malfoy said on the train, about his dad
being friends with Karkaroff? Now we know where they knew each other. They
were probably running around in masks together at the World Cup.... I'll tell you
one thing, though, Harry, if it was Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet, he's
going to be feeling really stupid now, isn't he? Didn't work, did it? You only got a
scratch! Come here - I'll do it -"
Pigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he was flying around and
around Harry's head, hooting incessantly. Ron snatched Pigwidgeon out of the air
and held him still while Harry attached the letter to his leg.
"There's no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous, how could
they be?" Ron went on as he carried Pigwidgeon to the window. "You know what?
I reckon you could win this tournament, Harry, I'm serious."
Harry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of the last
few weeks, but he appreciated it all the same. Hermione, however, leaned against
the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and frowned at Ron.
"Harry's got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament," she said
seriously. "If that was the first task, I hate to think what's coming next."
"Right little ray of sunshine, aren't you?" said Ron. "You and Professor Trelawney
should get together sometime."
He threw Pigwidgeon out of the window. Pigwidgeon plummeted twelve feet
before managing to pull himself back up again; the letter attached to his leg was
much longer and heavier than usual - Harry hadn't been able to resist giving Sirius
a blow-by-blow account of exactly how he had swerved, circled, and dodged the
Horntail. They watched Pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness, and then Ron
said, "Well, we'd better get downstairs for your surprise party, Harry - Fred and
George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now."
Sure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor common room it exploded with
cheers and yells again. There were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin
juice and butterbeer on every surface; Lee Jordan had let off some Filibuster's
Fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean Thomas, who
236was very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners, most of
which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail's head on his Firebolt, though
a couple showed Cedric with his head on fire.
Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel
properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione. He couldn't believe how
happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he'd gotten through the first task, and
he wouldn't have to face the second one for three months.
"Blimey, this is heavy," said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which Harry
had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands. "Open it, Harry, go on! Let's just
see what's inside it!"
"He's supposed to work out the clue on his own," Hermione said swiftly. "It's in
the tournament rules. . . ."
"I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too," Harry
muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and she grinned rather guiltily.
"Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!" several people echoed.
Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all
the way around it and prised it open.
It was hollow and completely empty - but the moment Harry opened it, the most
horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The nearest thing to it
Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick's deathday
party, who had all been playing the musical saw.
"Shut it!" Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.
"What was that?" said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed it
shut again. "Sounded like a banshee ... Maybe you've got to get past one of those
next, Harry!"
"It was someone being tortured!" said Neville, who had gone very white and
spilled sausage rolls all over the floor. "You're going to have to fight the Cruciatus
Curse!"
"Don't be a prat, Neville, that's illegal," said George. "They wouldn't use the
Cruciatus Curse on the champions. I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing . ..
maybe you've got to attack him while he's in the shower. Harry."
"Want a jam tart, Hermione?" said Fred.
Hermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her. Fred grinned.
"It's all right," he said. "I haven't done anything to them. It's the custard creams
you've got to watch -"
Neville, who had just bitten into a custard cream, choked and spat it out. Fred
237laughed.
"Just my little joke, Neville.. . ."
Hermione took a jam tart. Then she said, "Did you get all this from the kitchens,
Fred?"
"Yep," said Fred, grinning at her. He put on a high-pitched squeak and imitated a
house-elf. "'Anything we can get you, sir, anything at all!' They're dead helpful...
get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish."
"How do you get in there?" Hermione said in an innocently casual sort of voice.
"Easy," said Fred, "concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit. Just tickle
the pear, and it giggles and -" He stopped and looked suspiciously at her. "Why?"
"Nothing," said Hermione quickly.
"Going to try and lead the house-elves out on strike now, are you?" said George.
"Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion?"
Several people chortled. Hermione didn't answer.
"Don't you go upsetting them and telling them they've got to take clothes and
salaries!" said Fred warningly. "You'll put them off their cooking!"
Just then, Neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large canary.
"Oh - sorry, Neville!" Fred shouted over all the laughter. "I forgot - it was the
custard
creams we hexed -"
Within a minute, however, Neville had molted, and once his feathers had fallen
off, he reappeared looking entirely normal. He even joined in laughing.
"Canary Creams!" Fred shouted to the excitable crowd. "George and I invented
them - seven Sickles each, a bargain!"
It was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally went up to the dormitory with
Ron, Neville, Seamus, and Dean. Before he pulled the curtains of his four-poster
shut. Harry set his tiny model of the Hungarian Horntail on the table next to his
bed, where it yawned, curled up, and closed its eyes. Really, Harry thought, as he
pulled the hangings on his four-poster closed, Hagrid had a point.. . they were all
right, really, dragons. . . .
The start of December brought wind and sleet to Hogwarts. Drafty though the
castle always was in winter. Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time
he passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the high winds,
its black sails billowing
238against the dark skies. He thought the Beauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty
chilly too. Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping Madame Maxime's horses well
provided with their preferred drink of single-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting
from the trough in the comer of their paddock was enough to make the entire Care
of Magical Creatures class light-headed. This was unhelpful, as they were still
tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about them.
"I'm not sure whether they hibernate or not," Hagrid told the shivering class in the
windy pumpkin patch next lesson. "Thought we'd jus' try an see if they fancied a
kip . . . we'll jus' settle 'em down in these boxes. . . ."
There were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their desire to kill one another
had not been exercised out of them. Each of them was now approaching six feet in
length. Their thick gray armor; their powerful, scuttling legs; their fire-blasting
ends; their stings and their suckers, combined to make the skrewts the most
repulsive things Harry had ever seen. The class looked dispiritedly at the
enormous boxes Hagrid had brought out, all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets.
"We'll jus' lead 'em in here," Hagrid said, "an' put the lids on, and we'll see what
happens."
But the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and did not appreciate being
forced into pillow-lined boxes and nailed in. Hagrid was soon yelling, "Don panic,
now, don' panic!" while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin patch, now
strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes. Most of the class - Malfoy,
Crabbe, and Goyle in the lead - had fled into Hagrid's cabin through the back door
and barricaded themselves in; Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were among
those who remained outside trying to help Hagrid. Together they managed to
restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts, though at the cost of numerous burns and
cuts; finally, only one skrewt was left.
"Don' frighten him, now!" Hagrid shouted as Ron and Harry used their wands to
shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on them,
its sting arched, quivering, over its back. "Jus' try an slip the rope 'round his sting,
so he won hurt any o' the others!"
"Yeah, we wouldn't want that!" Ron shouted angrily as he and Harry backed into
the wall of Hagrid's cabin, still holding the skrewt off with their sparks.
"Well, well, well. . . this does look like fun."
Rita Skeeter was leaning on Hagrid's garden fence, looking in at the mayhem. She
was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today, and her
crocodile-skin handbag was over her arm.
Hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering Harry
and Ron and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the pumpkin
plants nearby.
239"Who're you?" Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope around the
skrewt's sting and tightened it.
"Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter," Rita replied, beaming at him. Her gold
teeth glinted.
"Thought Dumbledore said you weren' allowed inside the school anymore," said
Hagrid, frowning slightly as he got off the slightly squashed skrewt and started
tugging it over to its fellows.
Rita acted as though she hadn't heard what Hagrid had said.
"What are these fascinating creatures called?" she asked, beaming still more
widely.
"Blast-Ended Skrewts," grunted Hagrid.
"Really?" said Rita, apparently full of lively interest. "I've never heard of them
before...where do they come from?"
Harry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of Hagrid's wild black beard, and his
heart sank. Where had Hagrid got the skrewts from? Hermione, who seemed to be
thinking along these lines, said quickly, "They're very interesting, aren't they?
Aren't they. Harry?"
"What? Oh yeah . . . ouch . . . interesting," said Harry as she stepped on his foot.
"Ah, you're here. Harry!" said Rita Skeeter as she looked around. "So you like
Care of Magical Creatures, do you? One of your favorite lessons?"
"Yes," said Harry stoutly. Hagrid beamed at him.
"Lovely," said Rita. "Really lovely. Been teaching long?" she added to Hagrid.
Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across one cheek).
Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several
burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class stood, their
noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear.
"This is o'ny me second year," said Hagrid.
"Lovely... I don't suppose you'd like to give an interview, would you? Share some
of your experience of magical creatures? The Prophet does a zoological column
every Wednesday, as I'm sure you know. We could feature these - er - Bang-
Ended Scoots."
"Blast-Ended Skrewts," Hagrid said eagerly. "Er - yeah, why not?"
Harry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of communicating it
to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter seeing, so he had to stand and watch in silence as
Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for
240a good long interview later that week. Then the bell rang up at the castle, signaling
the end of the lesson.
"Well, good-bye, Harry!" Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with Ron
and Hermione. "Until Friday night, then, Hagrid!"
"She'll twist everything he says," Harry said under his breath.
"Just as long as he didn't import those skrewts illegally or anything," said
Hermione desperately. They looked at one another - it was exactly the sort of thing
Hagrid might do.
"Hagrids been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledores never sacked him,"
said Ron consolingly. "Worst that can happen is Hagrid'll have to get rid of the
skrewts. Sorry . . . did I say worst? I meant best."
Harry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to
lunch.
Harry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon; they were still doing
star charts and predictions, but now that he and Ron were friends once more, the
whole thing seemed very funny again. Professor Trelawney, who had been so
pleased with the pair of them when they had been predicting their own horrific
deaths, quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation of the
various ways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.
"I would think," she said, in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her obvious
annoyance, "that some of us" - she stared very meaningfully at Harry- "might be a
little less frivolous had they seen what I have seen during my crystal gazing last
night. As I sat here, absorbed in my needlework, the urge to consult the orb
overpowered me. I arose, I settled myself before it, and I gazed into its crystalline
depths . . . and what do you think I saw gazing back at me?"
"An ugly old bat in outsize specs?" Ron muttered under his breath.
Harry fought hard to keep his face straight.
"Death, my dears."
Parvati and Lavender both put their hands over their mouths, looking horrified.
"Yes," said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively, "it comes, ever closer, it
circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower. . . ever lower over the castle. . . ."
She stared pointedly at Harry, who yawned very widely and obviously.
"It'd be a bit more impressive if she hadn't done it about eighty times before,"
Harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath Professor
Trelawney's room. "But if I'd dropped dead every time she's told me I'm going to,
I'd be a medical miracle."
241"You'd be a sort of extra-concentrated ghost," said Ron, chortling, as they passed
the Bloody Baron going in the opposite direction, his wide eyes staring sinisterly.
"At least we didn't get homework. I hope Hermione got loads off Professor Vector,
I love not working when she is. . . ."
But Hermione wasn't at dinner, nor was she in the library when they went to look
for her afterward. The only person in there was Viktor Krum. Ron hovered behind
the bookshelves for a while, watching Krum, debating in whispers with Harry
whether he should ask for an autograph - but then Ron realized that six or seven
girls were lurking in the next row of books, debating exactly the same thing, and
he lost his enthusiasm for the idea.
"Wonder where she's got to?" Ron said as he and Harry went back to Gryffindor
Tower.
"Dunno . . . balderdash."
But the Fat Lady had barely begun to swing forward when the sound of racing feet
behind them announced Hermione's arrival.
"Harry!" she panted, skidding to a halt beside him (the Fat Lady stared down at
her, eyebrows raised). "Harry, you've got to come - you've got to come, the most
amazing thing's happened- please -"
She seized Harry's arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridor.
"What's the matter?" Harry said.
"I'll show you when we get there - oh come on, quick -"
Harry looked around at Ron; he looked back at Harry, intrigued.
"Okay," Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with Hermione, Ron
hurrying to keep up.
"Oh don't mind me!" the Fat Lady called irritably after them. "Don't apologize for
bothering me! I'll just hang here, wide open, until you get back, shall I?"
"Yeah, thanks!" Ron shouted over his shoulder.
"Hermione, where are we going?" Harry asked, after she had led
them down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the
entrance hall.
"You'll see, you'll see in a minute!" said Hermione excitedly.
She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through
which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated
his and Harry's names. Harry had never been through here before. He and Ron
followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in a
242gloomy underground passage like the one that led to Snape's dungeon, they found
themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with torches, and decorated with
cheerful paintings that were mainly of food.
"Oh hang on . . ." said Harry slowly, halfway down the corridor. "Wait a minute,
Hermione. . . ."
"What?" She turned around to look at him, anticipation all over her face.
"I know what this is about," said Harry.
He nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just behind Hermione. It showed a
gigantic silver fruit bowl.
"Hermione!" said Ron, cottoning on. "You're trying to rope us into that spew stuff
again!"
"No, no, I'm not!" she said hastily. "And it's not spew, Ron -"
"Changed the name, have you?" said Ron, frowning at her. "What are we now,
then, the House-Elf Liberation Front? I'm not barging into that kitchen and trying
to make them stop work, I'm not doing it -"
"I'm not asking you to!" Hermione said impatiently. "I came down here just now,
to talk to them all, and I found - oh come on, Harry, I want to show you!"
She seized his arm again, pulled him in front of the picture of the giant fruit bowl,
stretched out her forefinger, and tickled the huge green pear. It began to squirm,
chuckling, and suddenly turned into a large green door handle. Hermione seized it,
pulled the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back, forcing him inside.
He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high-ceilinged room, large as the Great
Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the
stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small
hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing, "Harry Potter, sir!
Harry Potter!"
Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him
hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.
"D-Dobby?" Harry gasped.
"It is Dobby, sir, it is!" squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel.
"Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has
come to see him, sir!"
Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his enormous,
green, tennis-ball-shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness. He looked
almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil-shaped nose, the batlike ears,
the long fingers and feet - all except the clothes, which were very different.
243When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same filthy old
pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments
Harry had ever seen; he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the
wizards at the World Cup. He was wearing a tea cozy for a hat, on which he had
pinned a number of bright badges; a tie patterned with horseshoes over a bare
chest, a pair of what looked like children's soccer shorts, and odd socks. One of
these, Harry saw, was the black one Harry had removed from his own foot and
tricked Mr. Malfoy into giving Dobby, thereby setting Dobby free. The other was
covered in pink and orange stripes.
"Dobby, what're you doing here?" Harry said in amazement. "Dobby has come to
work at Hogwarts, sir!" Dobby squealed excitedly. "Professor Dumbledore gave
Dobby and Winky jobs, sir!
"Winky?" said Harry. "She's here too?"
"Yes, sir, yes!" said Dobby, and he seized Harry's hand and pulled him off into the
kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there. Each of these tables,
Harry noticed as he passed them, was positioned exactly beneath the four House
tables above, in the Great Hall. At the moment, they were clear of food, dinner
having finished, but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes
that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above.
At least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen, beaming, bowing,
and curtsying as Dobby led Harry past them. They were all wearing the same
uniform: a tea towel stamped with the Hogwarts crest, and tied, as Winky's had
been, like a toga.
Dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed.
"Winky, sir!" he said.
Winky was sitting on a stool by the fire. Unlike Dobby, she had obviously not
foraged for clothes. She was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a matching
blue hat, which had holes in it for her large ears. However, while every one of
Dobby's strange collection of garments was so clean and well cared for that it
looked brand-new, Winky was plainly not taking care other clothes at all. There
were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt.
"Hello, Winky," said Harry.
Winky's lip quivered. Then she burst into tears, which spilled out of her great
brown eyes and splashed down her front, just as they had done at the Quidditch
World Cup.
"Oh dear," said Hermione. She and Ron had followed Harry and Dobby to the end
of the kitchen. "Winky, don't cry, please don't..."
But Winky cried harder than ever. Dobby, on the other hand, beamed up at Harry.
244"Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea?" he squeaked loudly, over Winky's sobs.
"Er - yeah, okay," said Harry.
Instantly, about six house-elves came trotting up behind him, bearing a large silver
tray laden with a teapot, cups for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a milk jug, and a
large plate of biscuits.
"Good service!" Ron said, in an impressed voice. Hermione frowned at him, but
the elves all looked delighted; they bowed very low and retreated.
"How long have you been here, Dobby?" Harry asked as Dobby handed around
the tea.
"Only a week. Harry Potter, sir!" said Dobby happily. "Dobby came to see
Professor Dumbledore, sir. You see, sir, it is very difficult for a house-elf who has
been dismissed to get a new position, sir, very difficult indeed -"
At this, Winky howled even harder, her squashed-tomato of a nose dribbling all
down her front, though she made no effort to stem the flow.
"Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to find work!"
Dobby squeaked. "But Dobby hasn't found work, sir, because Dobby wants paying
now!"
The house-elves all around the kitchen, who had been listening and watching with
interest, all looked away at these words, as though Dobby had said something rude
and embarrassing. Hermione, however, said, "Good for you, Dobby!"
"Thank you, miss!" said Dobby, grinning toothily at her. "But most wizards
doesn't want a house-elf who wants paying, miss. 'That's not the point of a house-
elf,' they says, and they slammed the door in Dobby's face! Dobby likes work, but
he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid. Harry Potter.... Dobby likes
being free!"
The Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging away from Dobby, as though
he were carrying something contagious. Winky, however, remained where she
was, though there was a definite increase in the volume other crying.
"And then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky, and finds out Winky has
been freed too, sir!" said Dobby delightedly.
At this, Winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay face-down on the
flagged stone floor, beating her tiny fists upon it and positively screaming with
misery. Hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her and tried to
comfort her, but nothing she said made the slightest difference. Dobby continued
with his story, shouting shrilly over Winky's screeches.
"And then Dobby had the idea. Harry Potter, sir! 'Why doesn't Dobby and Winky
find work together?' Dobby says. 'Where is there enough work for two house-
245elves?' says Winky. And Dobby thinks, and it comes to him, sir! Hogwarts! So
Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir, and Professor
Dumbledore took us on!"
Dobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled in his eyes again.
"And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, sir, if Dobby wants paying!
And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a
month!"
"That's not very much!" Hermione shouted indignantly from the floor, over
Winky's continued screaming and fist-beating.
"Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends off,"
said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the prospect of so much
leisure and riches were frightening, "but Dobby beat him down, miss. . . . Dobby
likes freedom, miss, but he isn't wanting too much, miss, he likes work better."
"And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you, Winky?" Hermione asked
kindly.
If she had thought this would cheer up Winky, she was wildly mistaken. Winky
did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her
massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious.
"Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting paid!" she squeaked.
"Winky is not sunk so low as that! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed!"
"Ashamed?" said Hermione blankly. "But - Winky, come on! It's Mr. Crouch who
should be ashamed, not you! You didn't do anything wrong, he was really horrible
to you -"
But at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat, flattening
her ears so that she couldn't hear a word, and screeched, "You is not insulting my
master, miss! You is not insulting Mr. Crouch! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard, miss!
Mr. Crouch is right to sack bad Winky!"
"Winky is having trouble adjusting, Harry Potter," squeaked Dobby confidentially.
"Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr. Crouch anymore; she is allowed to speak
her mind now, but she won't do it."
"Can't house-elves speak their minds about their masters, then?" Harry asked.
"Oh no, sir, no," said Dobby, looking suddenly serious. "'Tis part of the house-elf's
enslavement, sir. We keeps their secrets and our silence, sir. We upholds the
family's honor, and we never speaks ill of them - though Professor Dumbledore
told Dobby he does not insist upon this. Professor Dumbledore said we is free to -
to-"
Dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry closer. Harry bent forward.
246Dobby whispered, "He said we is free to call him a - a barmy old codger if we
likes, sir!"
Dobby gave a frightened sort of giggle.
"But Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter," he said, talking normally again, and
shaking his head so that his ears flapped. "Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore very
much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him."
"But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now?" Harry asked him,
grinning.
A slightly fearful look came into Dobby's immense eyes.
"Dobby - Dobby could," he said doubtfully. He squared his small shoulders.
"Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were - were - bad Dark
wizards'."
Dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror-struck by his own daring -
then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very
hard, squealing, "Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!"
Harry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the table.
"Thank you. Harry Potter, thank you," said Dobby breathlessly, rubbing his head.
"You just need a bit of practice," Harry said.
"Practice!" squealed Winky furiously. "You is ought to be ashamed of yourself,
Dobby, talking that way about your masters!"
"They isn't my masters anymore, Winky!" said Dobby defiantly. "Dobby doesn't
care what they think anymore!"
"Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby!" moaned Winky, tears leaking down her face once
more. "My poor Mr. Crouch, what is he doing without Winky? He is needing me,
he is needing my help! I is looking after the Crouches all my life, and my mother
is doing it before me, and my grandmother is doing it before her ... oh what is they
saying if they knew Winky was freed? Oh the shame, the shame!" She buried her
face in her skirt again and bawled.
"Winky," said Hermione firmly, "I'm quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along
perfectly well without you. We've seen him, you know -"
"You is seeing my master?" said Winky breathlessly, raising her tearstained face
out of her skirt once more and goggling at Hermione. "You is seeing him here at
Hogwarts?"
"Yes," said Hermione, "he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard
Tournament."
247"Mr. Bagman comes too?" squeaked Winky, and to Harry 's great surprise (and
Ron's and Hermione's too, by the looks on their faces), she looked angry again.
"Mr. Bagman is a bad wizard! A very bad wizard! My master isn't liking him, oh
no, not at all!"
"Bagman - bad?" said Harry.
"Oh yes," Winky said, nodding her head furiously, "My master is telling Winky
some things! But Winky is not saying.. . Winky - Winky keeps her master's
secrets. ..."
She dissolved yet again in tears; they could hear her sobbing into her skirt, "Poor
master, poor master, no Winky to help him no more!"
They couldn't get another sensible word out of Winky. They left her to her crying
and finished their tea, while Dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf and
his plans for his wages.
"Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!" he said happily, pointing at
his bare chest,
"Tell you what, Dobby," said Ron, who seemed to have taken a great liking to the
elf, "I'll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas, I always get one from
her. You don't mind maroon, do you?"
Dobby was delighted.
"We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you," Ron told him, "but it'll go well with
your tea cozy."
As they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding elves pressed in
upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs. Hermione refused, with a pained
look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying, but Harry and Ron loaded
their pockets with cream cakes and pies.
"Thanks a lot!" Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered around the door to
say good night. "See you, Dobby!"
"Harry Potter . . . can Dobby come and see you sometimes, sir?" Dobby asked
tentatively.
" 'Course you can," said Harry, and Dobby beamed.
"You know what?" said Ron, once he, Hermione, and Harry had left the kitchens
behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again. "All these years
I've been really impressed with Fred and George, nicking food from the kitchens -
well, it's not exactly difficult, is it? They can't wait to give it away!"
"I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves, you know,"
said Hermione, leading the way back up the marble staircase. "Dobby coming to
248work here, I mean. The other elves will see how happy he is, being free, and
slowly it'll dawn on them that they want that too!"
"Let's hope they don't look too closely at Winky," said Harry.
"Oh she'll cheer up," said Hermione, though she sounded a bit doubtful. "Once the
shock's worn off, and she's got used to Hogwarts, she'll see how much better off
she is without that Crouch man."
"She seems to love him," said Ron thickly (he had just started on a cream cake).
"Doesn't think much of Bagman, though, does she?" said Harry. "Wonder what
Crouch says at home about him?"
"Probably says he's not a very good Head of Department," said Hermione, "and
let's face it... he's got a point, hasn't he?"
"I'd still rather work for him than old Crouch," said Ron. "At least Bagman's got a
sense of humor."
"Don't let Percy hear you saying that," Hermione said, smiling slightly.
"Yeah, well, Percy wouldn't want to work for anyone with a sense of humor,
would he?" said Ron, now starting on a chocolate eclair. "Percy wouldn't
recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby's tea cozy."
249CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO - THE UNEXPECTED TASK
Potter! Weasley! Will you pay attention?"
Professor McGonagall's irritated voice cracked like a whip through the
Transfiguration class on Thursday, and Harry and Ron both jumped and looked
up.
It was the end of the lesson; they had finished their work; the guinea fowl they had
been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on Professor
McGonagall's desk (Neville's still had feathers); they had copied down their
homework from the blackboard ("Describe, with examples, the ways in which
Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing Cross-Species Switches"}.
The bell was due to ring at any moment, and Harry and Ron, who had been having
a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George's fake wands at the back of the
class, looked up, Ron holding a tin parrot and Harry, a rubber haddock.
"Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age," said
Professor McGonagall, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of
Harry's haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor - Ron's parrot's beak had
severed it moments before - "I have something to say to you all.
"The Yule Ball is approaching - a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and
an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests. Now, the ball will be
open only to fourth years and above - although you may invite a younger student if
you wish -"
Lavender Brown let out a shrill giggle. Parvati Patil nudged her hard in the ribs,
her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle. They both looked
around at Harry, Professor McGonagall ignored them, which Harry thought was
distinctly unfair, as she had just told off him and Ron.
"Dress robes will be worn," Professor McGonagall continued, "and the ball will
start at eight o'clock on Christmas Day, finishing at midnight in the Great Hall.
Now then -"
Professor McGonagall stared deliberately around the class.
"The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to - er - let our hair down," she said,
in a disapproving voice.
Lavender giggled harder than ever, with her hand pressed hard against her mouth
to stifle the sound. Harry could see what was funny this time: Professor
McGonagall, with her hair in a tight bun, looked as though she had never let her
hair down in any sense.
"But that does NOT mean," Professor McGonagall went on, "that we will be
250relaxing the standards of behavior we expect from Hogwarts students. I will be
most seriously displeased if a Gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any
way."
The bell rang, and there was the usual scuffle of activity as everyone packed their
bags and swung them onto their shoulders.
Professor McGonagall called above the noise, "Potter - a word, if you please."
Assuming this had something to do with his headless rubber haddock, Harry
proceeded gloomily to the teacher's desk. Professor McGonagall waited until the
rest of the class had gone, and then said, "Potter, the champions and their partners
-"
"What partners?" said Harry.
Profesor McGonagall looked suspiciously at him, as though she thought he was
trying to be funny.
"Your partners for the Yule Ball, Potter," she said coldly. "Your dance partners."
Harry's insides seemed to curl up and shrivel.
"Dance partners?" He felt himself going red. "I don't dance," he said quickly.
"Oh yes, you do," said Professor McGonagall irritably. "That's what I'm telling
you. Traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball."
Harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails, accompanied by
a girl in the sort of frilly dress Aunt Petunia always wore to Uncle Vernon's work
parties.
"I'm not dancing," he said.
"It is traditional," said Professor McGonagall firmly. "You are a Hogwarts
champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the
school. So make sure you get yourself a partner, Potter."
"But-I don't-"
"You heard me, Potter," said Professor McGonagall in a very final sort of way.
A week ago. Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a cinch
compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail. But now that he had done the latter,
and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball, he thought he'd rather have
another round with the dragon.
Harry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at
Hogwarts for Christmas; he always did, of course, because the alternative was
usually going back to Privet Drive, but he had always been very much in the
minority before now. This year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above
251seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with the coming
ball - or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how many girls Hogwarts
suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite noticed that before. Girls giggling
and whispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them,
girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on Christmas
night... .
"Why do they have to move in packs?" Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls
walked past them, sniggering and staring at Harry. "How're you supposed to get
one on their own to ask them?"
"Lasso one?" Ron suggested. "Got any idea who you're going to try?"
Harry didn't answer. He knew perfectly well whom he'd like to ask, but working
up the nerve was something else. . . . Cho was a year older than he was; she was
very pretty; she was a very good Quidditch player, and she was also very popular.
Ron seemed to know what was going on inside Harry's head.
"Listen, you're not going to have any trouble. You're a champion. You've just
beaten a Hungarian Horntail. I bet they'll be queuing up to go with you."
In tribute to their recently repaired friendship, Ron had kept the bitterness in his
voice to a bare minimum. Moreover, to Harry's amazement, he turned out to be
quite right.
A curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom Harry had never spoken in his
life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day. Harry was so taken
aback he said no before he'd even stopped to consider the matter. The girl walked
off looking rather hurt, and Harry had to endure Dean's, Seamus's, and Ron's
taunts about her all through History of Magic. The following day, two more girls
asked him, a second year and (to his horror) a fifth year who looked as though she
might knock him out if he refused.
"She was quite good-looking," said Ron fairly, after he'd stopped laughing.
"She was a foot taller than me," said Harry, still unnerved. "Imagine what I'd look
like trying to dance with her."
Hermione's words about Krum kept coming back to him. "They only like him
because he's famous!" Harry doubted very much if any of the girls who had asked
to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with him if he hadn't
been a school champion. Then he wondered if this would bother him if Cho asked
him.
On the whole. Harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of
opening the ball before him, life had definitely improved since he had got through
the first task. He wasn't attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors
anymore, which he suspected had a lot to do with Cedric - he had an idea Cedric
252might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave Harry alone, in gratitude for Harry's tip-
off about the dragons. There seemed to be fewer Support Cedric Diggory! badges
around too. Draco Malfoy, of course, was still quoting Rita Skeeter's article to him
at every possible opportunity, but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it -
and just to heighten Harry's feeling of well-being, no story about Hagrid had
appeared in the Daily Prophet.
"She didn' seem very int'rested in magical creatures, ter tell yeh the truth," Hagrid
said, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione asked him how his interview with Rita
Skeeter had gone during the last Care of Magical Creatures lesson of the term. To
their very great relief, Hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now,
and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today, sitting at a trestle table
and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to tempt the skrewts.
"She jus' wanted me ter talk about you, Harry," Hagrid continued in a low voice.
"Well, I told her we'd been friends since I went ter fetch yeh from the Dursleys.
'Never had to tell him off in four years?' she said. 'Never played you up in lessons,
has he?' I told her no, an she didn' seem happy at all. Yeh'd think she wanted me to
say yeh were horrible, Harry."
" 'Course she did," said Harry, throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal
bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more. "She can't keep writing about
what a tragic little hero I am, it'll get boring."
"She wants a new angle, Hagrid," said Ron wisely as he shelled salamander eggs.
"You were supposed to say Harry's a mad delinquent!"
"But he's not!" said Hagrid, looking genuinely shocked.
"She should've interviewed Snape," said Harry grimly. "He'd give her the goods
on me any day. 'Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this
school. . . .'"
"Said that, did he?" said Hagrid, while Ron and Hermione laughed. "Well, yeh
might've bent a few rules. Harry, bu' yeh're all righ' really, aren' you?"
"Cheers, Hagrid," said Harry, grinning.
"You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, Hagrid?" said Ron.
"Though' I might look in on it, yeah," said Hagrid gruffly. "Should be a good do, I
reckon. You'll be openin the dancin', won yeh, Harry? Who're you takin'?"
"No one, yet," said Harry, feeling himself going red again. Hagrid didn't pursue
the subject.
The last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed. Rumors
about the Yule Ball were flying everywhere, though Harry didn't believe half of
them - for instance, that Dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled
mead from Madam Rosmerta. It seemed to be fact, however, that he had booked
253the Weird Sisters. Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were Harry didn't know,
never having had access to a wizard's wireless, but he deduced from the wild
excitement of those who had grown up listening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless
Network) that they were a very famous musical group.
Some of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick, gave up trying to teach them
much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play games
in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent most of it talking to Harry about the perfect
Summoning Charm
Harry had used during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. Other teachers
were not so generous. Nothing would ever deflect Professor Binns, for example,
from plowing on through his notes on goblin rebellions - as Binns hadn't let his
own death stand in the way of continuing to teach, they supposed a small thing
like Christmas wasn't going to put him off. It was amazing how he could make
even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percys cauldron-bottom
report. Professors McGonagall and Moody kept them working until the very last
second of their classes too, and Snape, of course, would no sooner let them play
games in class than adopt Harry. Staring nastily around at them all, he informed
them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of
the term.
"Evil, he is," Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room.
"Springing a test on us on the last day. Ruining the last bit of term with a whole
load of studying."
"Mmm . . . you're not exactly straining yourself, though, are you?" said Hermione,
looking at him over the top of her Potions notes. Ron was busy building a card
castle out of his Exploding Snap pack - a much more interesting pastime than with
Muggle cards, because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at any
second.
"It's Christmas, Hermione," said Harry lazily; he was rereading Flying with the
Cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire.
Hermione looked severely over at him too. "I'd have thought you'd be doing
something constructive, Harry, even if you don't want to learn your antidotes!"
"Like what?" Harry said as he watched Joey Jenkins of the Cannons belt a Bludger
toward a Ballycastle Bats Chaser.
"That egg!" Hermione hissed.
"Come on, Hermione, I've got till February the twenty-fourth," Harry said.
He had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and hadn't opened it since the
celebration party after the first task. There were still two and a half months to go
until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant, after all.
254"But it might take weeks to work it out!" said Hermione. "You're going to look a
real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you don't!"
"Leave him alone, Hermione, he's earned a bit of a break," said Ron, and he placed
the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing his
eyebrows.
"Nice look, Ron ... go well with your dress robes, that will."
It was Fred and George. They sat down at the table with Harry, Ron, and
Hermione as Ron felt how much damage had been done.
"Ron, can we borrow Pigwidgeon?" George asked.
"No, he's off delivering a letter," said Ron. "Why?"
"Because George wants to invite him to the ball," said Fred sarcastically.
"Because we want to send a letter, you stupid great prat," said George.
"Who d'you two keep writing to, eh?" said Ron.
"Nose out, Ron, or I'll burn that for you too," said Fred, waving his wand
threateningly. "So . . . you lot got dates for the ball yet?"
"Nope," said Ron.
"Well, you'd better hurry up, mate, or all the good ones will be gone," said Fred.
"Who're you going with, then?" said Ron.
"Angelina," said Fred promptly, without a trace of embarrassment.
"What?" said Ron, taken aback. "You've already asked her?"
"Good point," said Fred. He turned his head and called across the common room,
"Oi! Angelina!"
Angelina, who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet near the fire, looked over at
him.
"What?" she called back.
"Want to come to the ball with me?"
Angelina gave Fred an appraising sort of look.
"All right, then," she said, and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting
with a bit of a grin on her face.
"There you go," said Fred to Harry and Ron, "piece of cake."
He got to his feet, yawning, and said, "We'd better use a school owl then, George,
255come on. .. ."
They left. Ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering
wreck of his card castle at Harry.
"We should get a move on, you know . . . ask someone. He's right. We don't want
to end up with a pair of trolls."
Hermione let out a sputter of indignation.
"A pair of... what, excuse me?"
"Well - you know," said Ron, shrugging. "I'd rather go alone than with - with
Eloise Midgen, say."
"Her acne's loads better lately - and she's really nice!"
"Her nose is off-center," said Ron.
"Oh I see," Hermione said, bristling. "So basically, you're going to take the best-
looking girl who'll have you, even if she's completely horrible?"
"Er - yeah, that sounds about right," said Ron.
"I'm going to bed," Hermione snapped, and she swept off toward the girls'
staircase without another word.
The Hogwarts staff, demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors from
Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, seemed determined to show the castle at its best
this Christmas. When the decorations went up. Harry noticed that they were the
most stunning he had yet seen inside the school. Everlasting icicles had been
attached to the banisters of the marble staircase; the usual twelve Christmas trees
in the Great Hall were bedecked with everything from luminous holly berries to
real, hooting, golden owls, and the suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing
carols whenever anyone passed them. It was quite something to hear "0 Come, All
Ye Faithful" sung by an empty helmet that only knew half the words. Several
times, Filch the caretaker had to extract Peeves from inside the armor, where he
had taken to hiding, filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own
invention, all of which were very rude.
And still. Harry hadn't asked Cho to the ball. He and Ron were getting very
nervous now, though as Harry pointed out, Ron would look much less stupid than
he would without a partner;
Harry was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other champions.
"I suppose there's always Moaning Myrtle," he said gloomily, referring to the
ghost who haunted the girls' toilets on the second floor.
"Harry - we've just got to grit our teeth and do it," said Ron on Friday morning, in
a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress.
256"When we get back to the common room tonight, we'll both have partners -
agreed?"
"Er . . . okay," said Harry.
But every time he glimpsed Cho that day - during break, and then lunchtime, and
once on the way to History of Magic - she was surrounded by friends. Didn't she
ever go anywhere alone? Could he perhaps ambush her as she was going into a
bathroom? But no - she even seemed to go there with an escort of four or five
girls. Yet if he didn't do it soon, she was bound to have been asked by somebody
else.
He found it hard to concentrate on Snape's Potions test, and consequently forgot to
add the key ingredient - a bezoar - meaning that he received bottom marks. He
didn't care, though; he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was
about to do. When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and hurried to the dungeon
door.
"I'll meet you at dinner," he said to Ron and Hermione, and he dashed off upstairs.
He'd just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was all. ... He hurried off
through the packed corridors looking for her, and (rather sooner than he had
expected) he found her, emerging from a Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.
"Er - Cho? Could I have a word with you?"
Giggling should be made illegal. Harry thought furiously, as all the girls around
Cho started doing it. She didn't, though. She said, "Okay," and followed him out of
earshot other classmates.
Harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had
missed a step going downstairs.
"Er," he said.
He couldn't ask her. He couldn't. But he had to. Cho stood there looking puzzled,
watching him. The words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around
them.
"Wangoballwime?"
"Sorry?" said Cho.
"D'you - d'you want to go to the ball with me?" said Harry. Why did he have to go
red now? Why?
"Oh!" s aid Cho, and she went red too. "Oh Harry, I'm really sorry," and she truly
looked it. "I've already said I'll go with someone else."
"Oh," said Harry.
257It was odd; a moment before his insides had been writhing like snakes, but
suddenly he didn't seem to have any insides at all.
"Oh okay," he said, "no problem."
"I'm really sorry," she said again.
"That's okay," said Harry.
They stood there looking at each other, and then Cho said, "Well-"
"Yeah," said Harry.
"Well, 'bye," said Cho, still very red. She walked away.
Harry called after her, before he could stop himself.
"Who're you going with?"
"Oh - Cedric," she said. "Cedric Diggory."
"Oh right," said Harry.
His insides had come back again. It felt as though they had been filled with lead in
their absence.
Completely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly back up to Gryffindor
Tower, Cho's voice echoing in his ears with every step he took. "Cedric - Cedric
Diggory." He had been starting to quite like Cedric - prepared to overlook the fact
that he had once beaten him at Quidditch, and was handsome, and popular, and
nearly everyone's favorite champion. Now he suddenly realized that Cedric was in
fact a useless pretty boy who didn't have enough brains to fill an eggcup.
"Fairy lights," he said dully to the Fat Lady - the password had been changed the
previous day.
"Yes, indeed, dear!" she trilled, straightening her new tinsel hair band as she
swung forward to admit him.
Entering the common room, Harry looked around, and to his surprise he saw Ron
sitting ashen-faced in a distant corner. Ginny was sitting with him, talking to him
in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice.
"What's up, Ron?" said Harry, joining them.
Ron looked up at Harry, a sort of blind horror in his face.
"Why did I do it?" he said wildly. "I don't know what made me do it!
"What?" said Harry.
"He - er - just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him," said Ginny. She
258looked as though she was fighting back a smile, but she kept patting Ron's arm
sympathetically.
"You what?' said Harry.
"I don't know what made me do it!" Ron gasped again. "What was I playing at?
There were people - all around - I've gone mad - everyone watching! I was just
walking past her in the entrance hall - she was standing there talking to Diggory -
and it sort of came over me - and I asked her!"
Ron moaned and put his face in his hands. He kept talking, though the words were
barely distinguishable.
"She looked at me like I was a sea slug or something. Didn't even answer. And
then - I dunno - I just sort of came to my senses and ran for it."
"She's part veela," said Harry. "You were right - her grandmother was one. It
wasn't your fault, I bet you just walked past when she was turning on the old
charm for Diggory and got a blast of it - but she was wasting her time. He's going
with Cho Chang."
Ron looked up.
"I asked her to go with me just now," Harry said dully, "and she told me."
Ginny had suddenly stopped smiling.
"This is mad," said Ron. "We're the only ones left who haven't got anyone - well,
except Neville. Hey - guess who he asked? Hermione!"
"What?" said Harry, completely distracted by this startling news.
"Yeah, I know!" said Ron, some of the color coming back into his face as he
started to laugh. "He told me after Potions! Said she's always been really nice,
helping him out with work and stuff- but she told him she was already going with
someone. Ha! As if! She just didn't want to go with Neville ... I mean, who
would?"
"Don't!" said Ginny, annoyed. "Don't laugh -"
Just then Hermione climbed in through the portrait hole.
"Why weren't you two at dinner?" she said, coming over to join them.
"Because - oh shut up laughing, you two - because they've both just been turned
down by girls they asked to the ball!" said Ginny.
That shut Harry and Ron up.
"Thanks a bunch, Ginny," said Ron sourly.
"All the good-looking ones taken, Ron?" said Hermione loftily. "Eloise Midgen
259starting to look quite pretty now, is she? Well, I'm sure you'll find someone
somewhere who'll have you."
But Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new
light.
"Hermione, Neville's right - you are a girl. . . ."
"Oh well spotted," she said acidly.
"Well - you can come with one of us!"
"No, I can't," snapped Hermione.
"Oh come on," he said impatiently, "we need partners, we're going to look really
stupid if we haven't got any, everyone else has . . ."
"I can't come with you," said Hermione, now blushing, "because I'm already going
with someone."
"No, you're not!" said Ron. "You just said that to get rid of Neville!"
"Oh did I?" said Hermione, and her eyes flashed dangerously. "Just because it's
taken you three years to notice, Ron, doesn't mean no one else has spotted I'm a
girl!"
Ron stared at her. Then he grinned again.
"Okay, okay, we know you're a girl," he said. "That do? Will you come now?"
"I've already told you!" Hermione said very angrily. "I'm going with someone
else!"
And she stormed off toward the girls' dormitories again.
"She's lying," said Ron flatly, watching her go.
"She's not," said Ginny quietly.
"Who is it then?" said Ron sharply.
"I'm not telling you, it's her business," said Ginny.
"Right," said Ron, who looked extremely put out, "this is getting stupid. Ginny,
you can go with Harry, and I'll just -"
"I can't," said Ginny, and she went scarlet too. "I'm going with - with Neville. He
asked me when Hermione said no, and I thought. . . well. . . I'm not going to be
able to go otherwise, I'm not in fourth year." She looked extremely miserable. "I
think I'll go and have dinner," she said, and she got up and walked off to the
portrait hole, her head bowed.
260Ron goggled at Harry.
"What's got into them?" he demanded.
But Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender come in through the portrait hole.
The time had come for drastic action.
"Wait here," he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to Parvati, and
said, "Parvati? Will you go to the ball with me?"
Parvati went into a fit of giggles. Harry waited for them to subside, his fingers
crossed in the pocket of his robes.
"Yes, all right then," she said finally, blushing furiously.
"Thanks," said Harry, in relief. "Lavender - will you go with Ron?"
"She's going with Seamus," said Parvati, and the pair of them giggled harder than
ever.
Harry sighed.
"Can't you think of anyone who'd go with Ron?" he said, lowering his voice so
that Ron wouldn't hear.
"What about Hermione Granger?" said Parvati.
"She's going with someone else."
Parvati looked astonished.
"Ooooh - who?" she said keenly.
Harry shrugged. "No idea," he said. "So what about Ron?"
"Well. . ." said Parvati slowly, "I suppose my sister might. . . Padma, you know ...
in Ravenclaw. I'll ask her if you like."
"Yeah, that would be great," said Harry. "Let me know, will you?"
And he went back over to Ron, feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than it
was worth, and hoping very much that Padma Patil's nose was dead center.
261CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE - THE YULE BALL
Despite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had been given for
the holidays. Harry was in no mood to work when term ended, and spent the week
leading up to Christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with everyone
else. Gryffindor Tower was hardly less crowded now than during term-time; it
seemed to have shrunk slightly too, as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier
than usual. Fred and George had had a great success with their Canary Creams,
and for the first couple of days of the holidays, people kept bursting into feather all
over the place. Before long, however, all the Gryffindors had learned to treat food
anybody else offered them with extreme caution, in case it had a Canary Cream
concealed in the center, and George confided to Harry that he and Fred were now
working on developing something else. Harry made a mental note never to accept
so much as a crisp from Fred and George in future. He still hadn't forgotten
Dudley and the Ton-Tongue Toffee.
Snow was falling thickly upon the castle and its grounds now. The pale blue
Beauxbatons carriage looked like a large, chilly, frosted pumpkin next to the iced
gingerbread house that was Hagrid's cabin, while the Durmstrang ship's portholes
were glazed with ice, the rigging white with frost. The house-elves down in the
kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of rich, warming stews and savory
puddings, and only Fleur Delacour seemed to be able to find anything to complain
about.
"It is too 'eavy, all zis 'Ogwarts food," they heard her saying grumpily as they left
the Great Hall behind her one evening (Ron skulking behind Harry, keen not to be
spotted by Fleur). "I will not fit into my dress robes!"
"Oooh there's a tragedy," Hermione snapped as Fleur went out into the entrance
hall. "She really thinks a lot of herself, that one, doesn't she?"
"Hermione - who are you going to the ball with?" said Ron.
He kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a response by
asking it when she least expected it. However, Hermione merely frowned and said,
"I'm not telling you, you'll just make fun of me."
"You're joking, Weasley!" said Malfoy, behind them. "You're not telling me
someone's asked that to the ball? Not the long-molared Mudblood?" ;
Harry and Ron both whipped around, but Hermione said loudly, waving to
somebody over Malfoys shoulder, "Hello, Professor Moody!"
Malfoy went pale and jumped backward, looking wildly around for Moody, but he
was still up at the staff table, finishing his stew.
262"Twitchy little ferret, aren't you, Malfoy?" said Hermione scathingly, and she,
Harry, and Ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily.
"Hermione," said Ron, looking sideways at her, suddenly frowning, "your teeth ..."
"What about them?" she said.
"Well, they're different. . . I've just noticed. . . ."
"Of course they are - did you expect me to keep those fangs Malfoy gave me?"
"No, I mean, they're different to how they were before he put that hex on you. . . .
They're all... straight and - and normal-sized."
Hermione suddenly smiled very mischievously, and Harry noticed it too: It was a
very different smile from the one he remembered.
"Well. . . when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get them shrunk, she held up a
mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally were,"
she said. "And I just. . . let her carry on a bit." She smiled even more widely.
"Mum and Dad won't be too pleased. I've been trying to persuade them to let me
shrink them for ages, but they wanted me to carry on with my braces. You know,
they're dentists, they just don't think teeth and magic should - look! Pigwidgeons
back!"
Ron's tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the icicle-laden banisters, a
scroll of parchment tied to his leg. People passing him were pointing and laughing,
and a group of third-year girls paused and said, "Oh look at the weeny owl! Isn't
he cute?"
Stupid little feathery git!" Ron hissed, hurrying up the stairs and snatching up
Pigwidgeon. "You bring letters to the addressee! You don't hang around showing
off!"
Pigwidgeon hooted happily, his head protruding over Ron's fist. The third-year
girls all looked very shocked.
"Clear off!" Ron snapped at them, waving the fist holding Pigwidgeon, who
hooted more happily than ever as he soared through the air. "Here - take it, Harry,"
Ron added in an undertone as the third-year girls scuttled away looking
scandalized. He pulled Sirius's reply off Pigwidgeons leg. Harry pocketed it, and
they hurried back to Gryffindor Tower to read it.
Everyone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more holiday
steam to observe what anyone else was up to. Ron, Harry, and Hermione sat apart
from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with snow, and
Harry read out:
Dear Harry,
263Congratulations on getting past the Horntail. Whoever put your name in that
goblet shouldn't be feeling too happy right now! I was going to suggest a
Conjunctivitus Curse, as a dragon's eyes are its weakest point - "That's what Krum
did!" Hermione whispered - but your way was better, I'm impressed.
Don't get complacent, though. Harry. You've only done one task; whoever put you
in for the tournament's got plenty more opportunity if they're trying to hurt you.
Keep your eyes open -particularly when the person we discussed is around and
concentrate on keeping yourself out of trouble.
Keep in touch, I still want to hear about anything unusual.
Sirius
"He sounds exactly like Moody," said Harry quietly, tucking the letter away again
inside his robes. "'Constant vigilance!' You'd think I walk around with my eyes
shut, banging off the walls. ..."
"But he's right, Harry," said Hermione, "you have still got two tasks to do. You
really ought to have a look at that egg, you know, and start working out what it
means. . . ."
"Hermione, he's got ages!" snapped Ron. "Want a game of chess, Harry?"
"Yeah, okay," said Harry. Then, spotting the look on Hermione's face, he said,
"Come on, how'm I supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on? I won't
even be able to hear the egg over this lot."
"Oh I suppose not," she sighed, and she sat down to watch their chess match,
which culminated in an exciting checkmate of Ron's, involving a couple of
recklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishop.
Harry awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day. Wondering what had caused his
abrupt return to consciousness, he opened his eyes, and saw something with very
large, round, green eyes staring back at him in the darkness, so close they were
almost nose to nose.
"Dobby!" Harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost fell out of
bed. "Don't do that!"
"Dobby is sorry, sir!" squeaked Dobby anxiously, jumping backward with his long
fingers over his mouth. "Dobby is only wanting to wish Harry Potter 'Merry
Christmas' and bring him a present, Sir! Harry Potter did say Dobby could come
and see him sometimes, sir!"
It's okay," said Harry, still breathing rather faster than usual, while his heart rate
returned to normal. "Just - just prod me or something in future, all right, don't bend
over me like that. .."
Harry pulled back the curtains around his four-poster, took his glasses from his
264bedside table, and put them on. His yell had awoken Ron, Seamus, Dean, and
Neville. All of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings, heavy-
eyed and tousle-haired.
"Someone attacking you, Harry?" Seamus asked sleepily.
"No, it's just Dobby," Harry muttered. "Go back to sleep."
"Nah . . . presents!" said Seamus, spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed. Ron,
Dean, and Neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down
to some present-opening too. Harry turned back to Dobby, who was now standing
nervously next to Harrys bed, still looking worried that he had upset Harry. There
was a Christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea cozy.
"Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present?" he squeaked tentatively.
"'Course you can," said Harry. "Er. . . I've got something for you too."
It was a lie; he hadn't bought anything for Dobby at all, but he quickly opened his
trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly rolled-up pair of socks. They were his
oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had once belonged to Uncle Vernon. The
reason they were extra-knobbly was that Harry had been using them to cushion his
Sneakoscope for over a year now. He pulled out the Sneako-scope and handed the
socks to Dobby, saying, "Sorry, I forgot to wrap them..."
But Dobby was utterly delighted.
"Socks are Dobby's favorite, favorite clothes, sir!" he said, ripping off his odd ones
and pulling on Uncle Vernon's. "I has seven now, sir. . . . But sir ..." he said, his
eyes widening, having pulled both socks up to their highest extent, so that they
reached to the bottom of his shorts, "they has made a mistake in the shop, Harry
Potter, they is giving you two the same!"
"Ah, no, Harry, how come you didn't spot that?" said Ron, grinning over from his
own bed, which was now strewn with wrapping paper. "Tell you what, Dobby -
here you go - take these two, and you can mix them up properly. And here's your
sweater."
He threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped, and the hand-
knitted sweater Mrs. Weasley had sent, Dobby looked quite overwhelmed.
"Sir is very kind!" he squeaked, his eyes brimming with tears again, bowing
deeply to Ron. "Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard, for he is Harry Potter's
greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit, as
noble, as selfless -"
"They're only socks," said Ron, who had gone slightly pink around the ears,
though he looked rather pleased all the same. "Wow, Harry -" He had just opened
Harry's present, a Chudley Cannon hat. "Cool!" He jammed it onto his head,
where it clashed horribly with his hair.
265Dobby now handed Harry a small package, which turned out to be - socks.
"Dobby is making them himself, sir!" the elf said happily. "He is buying the wool
out of his wages, sir!"
The left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it; the right
sock was green with a pattern of Snitches.
"They're . . . they're really . . . well, thanks, Dobby," said Harry, and he pulled
them on, causing Dobby's eyes to leak with happiness again.
"Dobby must go now, sir, we is already making Christmas dinner in the kitchens!"
said Dobby, and he hurried out of the dormitory, waving good-bye to Ron and the
others as he passed.
Harry's other presents were much more satisfactory than Dobby's odd socks - with
the obvious exception of the Dursleys', which consisted of a single tissue, an all-
time low - Harry supposed they too were remember ing the Ton-Tongue Toffee.
Hermione had given Harry a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland;
Ron, a bulging bag of Dungbombs; Sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to
unlock any lock and undo any knot; and Hagrid, a vast box of sweets including all
Harrys favorites: Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble's
Best Blowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees. There was also, of course, Mrs.
Weasley's usual package, including a new sweater (green, with a picture of a
dragon on it - Harry supposed Charlie had told her all about the Horntail), and a
large quantity of homemade mince pies.
Harry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common room, and they went down
to breakfast together. They spent most of the morning in Gryffindor Tower, where
everyone was enjoying their presents, then returned to the Great Hall for a
magnificent lunch, which included at least a hundred turkeys and Christmas
puddings, and large piles of Cribbage's Wizarding Crackers.
They went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the snow was untouched except
for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students on their
way up to the castle. Hermione chose to watch Harry and the Weasleys' snowball
fight rather than join in, and at five o'clock said she was going back upstairs to get
ready for the ball.
"What, you need three hours?" said Ron, looking at her incredulously and paying
for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball, thrown by George, hit him
hard on the side of the head. "Who're you going with?" he yelled after Hermione,
but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle.
There was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven o'clock,
when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned their snowball
fight and trooped back to the common room. The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame
with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes
of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom other picture.
266"Lairy fights, that's the one!" she giggled when they gave the password, and she
swung forward to let them inside.
Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into their dress robes up in their
dormitory, all of them looking very self-conscious, but none as much as Ron, who
surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face.
There was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress
than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he used
a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs. It worked fairly well; at least he was now
lace-free, although he hadn't done a very neat job, and the edges still looked
depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs.
"I still can't work out how you two got the best-looking girls in the year," muttered
Dean.
"Animal magnetism," said Ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of his cuffs.
The common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors instead
of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot of the stairs.
She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait
braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists. Harry was relieved
to see that she wasn't giggling.
"You - er - look nice," he said awkwardly.
"Thanks," she said. "Padma's going to meet you in the entrance hall," she added to
Ron.
"Right," said Ron, looking around. "Where's Hermione?"
Parvati shrugged. "Shall we go down then, Harry?"
"Okay," said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room. Fred winked
at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole.
The entrance hall was packed with students too, all milling around waiting for
eight o'clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open. Those
people who were meeting partners from different Houses were edging through the
crowd trying to find one another. Parvati found her sister, Padma, and led her over
to Harry and Ron.
"Hi," said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in robes of bright
turquoise. She didn't look too enthusiastic about having Ron as a partner, though;
her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes as she
looked him up and down.
"Hi," said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around at the crowd. "Oh no ..."
He bent his knees slightly to hide behind Harry, because Fleur Delacour was
passing, looking stunning in robes of silver-gray satin, and accompanied by the
267Ravenclaw Quidditch captain, Roger Davies. When they had disappeared, Ron
stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd.
"Where is Hermione?" he said again.
A group of Slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room.
Malfoy was in front; he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar,
which in Harry's opinion made him look like a vicar. Pansy Parkinson in very
frilly robes of pale pink was clutching Malfoy's arm. Crabbe and Goyle were both
wearing green; they resembled moss-colored boulders, and neither of them, Harry
was pleased to see, had managed to find a partner.
The oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the Durmstrang
students entered with Professor Karkaroff. Krum was at the front of the party,
accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes Harry didn't know. Over their heads he
saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a
sort of grotto full of fairy lights - meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were
sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there, and fluttering over the
statues of what seemed to be Father Christmas and his reindeer.
Then Professor McGonagall's voice called, "Champions over here, please!"
Parvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and Harry said, "See you in a minute"
to Ron and Padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to let them
through. Professor McGonagall, who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and
had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim other hat, told them
to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside; they were to
enter the Great Hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down.
Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies stationed themselves nearest the doors; Davies
looked so stunned by his good fortune in having Fleur for a partner that he could
hardly take his eyes off her. Cedric and Cho were close to Harry too; he looked
away from them so he wouldn't have to talk to them. His eyes fell instead on the
girl next to Krum. His jaw dropped.
It was Hermione.
But she didn't look like Hermione at all. She had done something with her hair; it
was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot at the
back of her head. She was wearing robes made of a floaty, periwinkle-blue
material, and she was holding herself differently, somehow - or maybe it was
merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung over her back.
She was also smiling - rather nervously, it was true - but the reduction in the size
of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever; Harry couldn't understand how
he hadn't spotted it before.
"Hi, Harry!" she said. "Hi, Parvati!"
Parvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief. She wasn't the only one
either; when the doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum's fan club from the library
268stalked past, throwing Hermione looks of deepest loathing. Pansy Parkinson gaped
at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn't seem to be able to find an
insult to throw at her. Ron, however, walked right past Hermione without looking
at her.
Once everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor McGonagall told the
champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her. They did so,
and everyone in the Great Hall applauded as they entered and started walking up
toward a large round table at the top of the Hall, where the judges were sitting.
The walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost, with hundreds
of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling. The House tables
had vanished; instead, there were about a hundred smaller, lantern-lit ones, each
seating about a dozen people.
Harry concentrated on not tripping over his feet. Parvati seemed to be enjoying
herself; she was beaming around at everybody, steering Harry so forcefully that he
felt as though he were a show dog she was putting through its paces. He caught
sight of Ron and Padma as he neared the top table. Ron was watching Hermione
pass with narrowed eyes. Padma was looking sulky.
Dumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table, but
Karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like Ron's as he watched Krum and
Hermione draw nearer. Ludo Bagman, tonight in robes of bright purple with large
yellow stars, was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the students; and Madame
Maxime, who had changed her usual uniform of black satin for a flowing gown of
lavender silk, was applauding them politely. But Mr. Crouch, Harry suddenly
realized, was not there. The fifth seat at the table was occupied by Percy Weasley.
When the champions and their partners reached the table, Percy drew out the
empty chair beside him, staring pointedly at Harry. Harry took the hint and sat
down next to Percy, who was wearing brand-new, navy-blue dress robes and an
expression of such smugness that Harry thought it ought to be fined.
"I've been promoted," Percy said before Harry could even ask, and from his tone,
he might have been announcing his election as supreme ruler of the universe. "I'm
now Mr. Crouch's personal assistant, and I'm here representing him."
"Why didn't he come?" Harry asked. He wasn't looking forward to being lectured
on cauldron bottoms all through dinner.
"I'm afraid to say Mr. Crouch isn't well, not well at all. Hasn't been right since the
World Cup. Hardly surprising - overwork. He's not as young as he was - though
still quite brilliant, of course, the mind remains as great as it ever was. But the
World Cup was a fiasco for the whole Ministry, and then, Mr. Crouch suffered a
huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that house-elf of his, Blinky, or
whatever she was called. Naturally, he dismissed her immediately afterward, but -
well, as I say, he's getting on, he needs looking after, and I think he's found a
269definite drop in his home comforts since she left. And then we had the tournament
to arrange, and the aftermath of the Cup to deal with - that revolting Skeeter
woman buzzing around - no, poor man, he's having a well earned, quiet Christmas.
I'm just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place."
Harry wanted very much to ask whether Mr. Crouch had stopped calling Percy
"Weatherby" yet, but resisted the temptation.
There was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates, but small menus were
lying in front of each of them. Harry picked his up uncertainly and looked around -
there were no waiters. Dumbledore, however, looked carefully down at his own
menu, then said very clearly to his plate, "Pork chops!"
And pork chops appeared. Getting the idea, the rest of the table placed their orders
with their plates too. Harry glanced up at Hermione to see how she felt about this
new and more complicated method of dining - surely it meant plenty of extra work
for the house-elves? - but for once, Hermione didn't seem to be thinking about
S.P.E.W. She was deep in talk with Viktor Krum and hardly seemed to notice
what she was eating.
It now occurred to Harry that he had never actually heard Krum speak before, but
he was certainly talking now, and very enthusiastically at that.
"Veil, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as comfortable, I am thinking,"
he was telling Hermione. "Ve have just four floors, and the fires are lit only for
magical purposes. But ve have grounds larger even than these - though in vinter,
ve have very little daylight, so ve are not enjoying them. But in summer ve are
flying every day, over the lakes and the mountains -"
"Now, now, Viktor!" said Karkaroff with a laugh that didn't reach his cold eyes,
"don't go giving away anything else, now, or your charming friend will know
exactly where to find us!"
Dumbledore smiled, his eyes twinkling. "Igor, all this secrecy ., . one would
almost think you didn't want visitors."
"Well, Dumbledore," said Karkaroff, displaying his yellowing teeth to their fullest
extent, "we are all protective of our private domains, are we not? Do we not
jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us? Are we not
right to be proud that we alone know our school's secrets, and right to protect
them?"
"Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts' secrets, Igor," said
Dumbledore amicably. "Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong turning on
the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I
have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of
chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the
room had vanished. But I must keep an eye out for it. Possibly it is only accessible
at five-thirty in the morning. Or it may only appear at the quarter moon - or when
270the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder."
Harry snorted into his plate of goulash. Percy frowned, but Harry could have
sworn Dumbledore had given him a very small wink.
Meanwhile Fleur Delacour was criticizing the Hogwarts decorations to Roger
Davies.
"Zis is nothing," she said dismissively, looking around at the sparkling walls of the
Great Hall. "At ze Palace of Beauxbatons, we 'ave ice sculptures all around ze
dining chamber at Chreestmas. Zey do not melt, of course . . . zey are like 'uge
statues of diamond, glittering around ze place. And ze food is seemply superb.
And we 'ave choirs of wood nymphs, 'oo serenade us as we eat. We 'ave none of
zis ugly armor in ze 'alls, and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into Beauxbatons, 'e
would be expelled like zat." She slapped her hand onto the table impatiently.
Roger Davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his face, and he
kept missing his mouth with his fork. Harry had the impression that Davies was
too busy staring at Fleur to take in a word she was saying.
"Absolutely right," he said quickly, slapping his own hand down on the table in
imitation of Fleur. "Like that. Yeah."
Harry looked around the Hall. Hagrid was sitting at one of the other staff tables; he
was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top table. Harry saw
him give a small wave, and looking around, saw Madame Maxime return it, her
opals glittering in the candlelight.
Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept calling her
"Hermy-own."
"Her-my-oh-nee," she said slowly and clearly.
"Herm-own-ninny."
"Close enough," she said, catching Harry's eye and grinning.
When all the food had been consumed, Dumbledore stood up and asked the
students to do the same. Then, with a wave of his wand, all the tables zoomed
back along the walls leaving the floor clear, and then he conjured a raised platform
into existence along the right wall. A set of drums, several guitars, a lute, a cello,
and some bagpipes were set upon it.
The "Weird Sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic applause;
they were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully
ripped and torn. They picked up their instruments, and Harry, who had been so
interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was coming,
suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out, and that the
other champions and their partners were standing up.
271"Come on!" Parvati hissed. "We're supposed to dance!"
Harry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up. The Weird Sisters struck up a
slow, mournful tune; Harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor, carefully
avoiding catching anyone's eye (he could see Seamus and Dean waving at him and
sniggering), and next moment, Parvati had seized his hands, placed one around her
waist, and was holding the other tightly in hers.
It wasn't as bad as it could have been. Harry thought, revolving slowly on the spot
(Parvati was steering). He kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching
people, and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance floor, so that the
champions were no longer the center of attention. Neville and Ginny were dancing
nearby - he could see Ginny wincing frequently as Neville trod on her feet - and
Dumbledore was waltzing with Madame Maxime. He was so dwarfed by her that
the top of his pointed hat barely tickled her chin; however, she moved very
gracefully for a woman so large. Mad-Eye Moody was doing an extremely
ungainly two-step with Professor Sinistra, who was nervously avoiding his
wooden leg.
"Nice socks. Potter," Moody growled as he passed, his magical eye staring through
Harry's robes.
"Oh - yeah, Dobby the house-elf knitted them for me," said Harry, grinning.
"He is so creepy!" Parvati whispered as Moody clunked away. "I don't think that
eye should be allowed."
Harry heard the final, quavering note from the bagpipe with relief. The Weird
Sisters stopped playing, applause filled the hall once more, and Harry let go of
Parvati at once.
"Let's sit down, shall we?"
"Oh - but - this is a really good one!" Parvati said as the Weird Sisters struck up a
new song, which was much faster.
"No, I don't like it," Harry lied, and he led her away from the dance floor, past
Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them
were backing away in fear of injury, and over to the table where Ron and Padma
were sitting.
"How's it going?" Harry asked Ron, sitting down and opening a bottle of
butterbeer.
Ron didn't answer. He was glaring at Hermione and Krum, who were dancing
nearby. Padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed, one foot jiggling in
time to the music. Every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at Ron, who
was completely ignoring her. Parvati sat down on Harry's other side, crossed her
arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from
272Beauxbatons.
"You don't mind, do you, Harry?" Parvati said.
"What?" said Harry, who was now watching Cho and Cedric.
"Oh never mind," snapped Parvati, and she went off with the boy from
Beauxbatons. When the song ended, she did not return.
Hermione came over and sat down in Parvati's empty chair. She was a bit pink in
the face from dancing.
"Hi," said Harry. Ron didn't say anything.
"It's hot, isn't it?" said Hermione, fanning herself with her hand. "Viktors just gone
to get some drinks."
Ron gave her a withering look. "Viktor?" he said. "Hasn't he asked you to call him
Vicky yet?"
Hermione looked at him in surprise. "What's up with you?" she said.
"If you don't know," said Ron scathingly, "I'm not going to tell you."
Hermione stared at him, then at Harry, who shrugged.
"Ron, what - ?"
"He's from Durmstrang!" spat Ron. "He's competing against Harry! Against
Hogwarts! You - you're -" Ron was obviously casting around for words strong
enough to describe Hermione's crime, "fraternizing with the enemy, that's what
you're doing!"
Hermione's mouth fell open.
"Don't be so stupid!" she said after a moment. "The enemy! Honestly - who was
the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive? Who was the one who
wanted his autograph? Who's got a model of him up in their dormitory?"
Ron chose to ignore this. "I s'pose he asked you to come with him while you were
both in the library?"
"Yes, he did," said Hermione, the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more
brightly. "So what?"
"What happened - trying to get him to join spew, were you?"
"No, I wasn't! If you really want to know, he - he said he'd been coming up to the
library every day to try and talk to me, but he hadn't been able to pluck up the
courage!"
Hermione said this very quickly, and blushed so deeply that she was the same
273color as Parvati's robes.
"Yeah, well - that's his story," said Ron nastily.
"And what's that supposed to mean?"
"Obvious, isn't it? He's Karkaroff's student, isn't he? He knows who you hang
around with. . . . He's just trying to get closer to Harry - get inside information on
him - or get near enough to jinx him -"
Hermione looked as though Ron had slapped her. When she spoke, her voice
quivered.
"For your information, he hasn't asked me one single thing about Harry, not one -"
Ron changed tack at the speed of light.
"Then he's hoping you'll help him find out what his egg means! I suppose you've
been putting your heads together during those cozy little library sessions -"
"I'd never help him work out that egg!" said Hermione, looking outraged. "Never.
How could you say something like that - I want Harry to win the tournament.
Harry knows that, don't you, Harry?"
"You've got a funny way of showing it," sneered Ron.
"This whole tournament's supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards
and making friends with them!" said Hermione hotly.
"No it isn't!" shouted Ron. "It's about winning!"
People were starting to stare at them.
"Ron," said Harry quietly, "I haven't got a problem with Hermione coming with
Krum -"
But Ron ignored Harry too.
"Why don't you go and find Vicky, he'll be wondering where you are," said Ron.
"Don't call him Vicky!"
Hermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor, disappearing
into the crowd. Ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his
face.
"Are you going to ask me to dance at all?" Padma asked him.
"No," said Ron, still glaring after Hermione.
"Fine," snapped Padma, and she got up and went to join Parvati and the
Beauxbatons boy, who conjured up one of his friends to join them so fast that
274Harry could have sworn he had zoomed him there by a Summoning Charm.
"Vare is Herm-own-ninny?" said a voice.
Krum had just arrived at their table clutching two butterbeers.
"No idea," said Ron mulishly, looking up at him. "Lost her, have you?"
Krum was looking surly again.
"Veil, if you see her, tell her I haff drinks," he said, and he slouched off.
"Made friends with Viktor Krum, have you, Ron?"
Percy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together and looking extremely
pompous. "Excellent! That's the whole point, you know - international magical
cooperation!"
To Harry's displeasure, Percy now took Padma's vacated seat. The top table was
now empty; Professor Dumbledore was dancing with Professor Sprout, Ludo
Bagman with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime and Hagrid were cutting a
wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students, and
Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen. When the next song ended, everybody
applauded once more, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor McGonagall's
hand and make his way back through the crowds, at which point Fred and George
accosted him.
"What do they think they're doing, annoying senior Ministry members?" Percy
hissed, watching Fred and George suspiciously. "No respect..."
Ludo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly quickly, however, and, spotting
Harry, waved and came over to their table.
"I hope my brothers weren't bothering you, Mr. Bagman?" said Percy at once.
"What? Oh not at all, not at all!" said Bagman. "No, they were just telling me a bit
more about those fake wands of theirs. Wondering if I could advise them on the
marketing. I've promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at
Zonko's Joke Shop. ..."
Percy didn't look happy about this at all, and Harry was prepared to bet he would
be rushing to tell Mrs. Weasley about this the moment he got home. Apparently
Fred and George's plans had grown even more ambitious lately, if they were
hoping to sell to the public. Bagman opened his mouth to ask Harry something,
but Percy diverted him.
"How do you feel the tournament's going, Mr. Bagman? Our department's quite
satisfied - the hitch with the Goblet of Fire" - he glanced at Harry - "was a little
unfortunate, of course, but it seems to have gone very smoothly since, don't you
think?"
275"Oh yes," Bagman said cheerfully, "it's all been enormous fun. How's old Barty
doing? Shame he couldn't come."
"Oh I'm sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time," said Percy importantly,
"but in the meantime, I'm more than willing to take up the slack. Of course, it's not
all attending balls" - he laughed airily - "oh no, I've had to deal with all sorts of
things that have cropped up in his absence - you heard Ali Bashir was caught
smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country? And then we've been
trying to persuade the Transylvanians to sign the International Ban on Dueling.
I've got a meeting with their Head of Magical Cooperation in the new year -"
"Let's go for a walk," Ron muttered to Harry, "get away from Percy. ..."
Pretending they wanted more drinks. Harry and Ron left the table, edged around
the dance floor, and slipped out into the entrance hall. The front doors stood open,
and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked and twinkled as they went
down the front steps, where they found themselves surrounded by bushes;
winding, ornamental paths; and large stone statues. Harry could hear splashing
water, which sounded like a fountain. Here and there, people were sitting on
carved benches. He and Ron set off along one of the winding paths through the
rosebushes, but they had gone only a short way when they heard an unpleasantly
familiar voice.
"... don't see what there is to fuss about, Igor."
"Severus, you cannot pretend this isn't happening!" Karkaroffs voice sounded
anxious and hushed, as though keen not to be overheard. "It's been getting clearer
and clearer for months. I am becoming seriously concerned, I can't deny it _"
"Then flee," said Snapes voice curtly. "Flee - I will make your excuses. I,
however, am remaining at Hogwarts."
Snape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Snape had his wand out and was
blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most ill-natured. Squeals issued from
many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from them.
"Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!" Snape snarled as a girl ran past him. "And
ten points from Hufflepuff too, Stebbins!" as a boy went rushing after her. "And
what are you two doing?" he added, catching sight of Harry and Ron on the path
ahead. Karkaroff, Harry saw, looked slightly discomposed to see them standing
there. His hand went nervously to his goatee, and he began winding it around his
finger.
"We re walking," Ron told Snape shortly. "Not against the law, is it?"
"Keep walking, then!" Snape snarled, and he brushed past them, his long black
cloak billowing out behind him. Karkaroff hurried away after Snape. Harry and
Ron continued down the path.
276"What's got Karkaroff all worried?" Ron muttered.
"And since when have he and Snape been on first-name terms?"said Harry slowly.
They had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which they could see the
sparkling jets of a tall fountain. The shadowy outlines of two enormous people
were visible on a stone bench, watching the water in the moonlight. And then
Harry heard Hagrid speak.
"Momen' I saw yeh, I knew," he was saying, in an oddly husky voice.
Harry and Ron froze. This didn't sound like the sort of scene they ought to walk in
on, somehow. . . . Harry looked around, back up the path, and saw Fleur Delacour
and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in a rosebush nearby. He tapped Ron on
the shoulder and jerked his head toward them, meaning that they could easily
sneak off that way without being noticed (Fleur and Davies looked very busy to
Harry), but Ron, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur, shook his head
vigorously, and pulled Harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer.
"What did you know, 'Agrid?" said Madame Maxime, a purr in her low voice.
Harry definitely didn't want to listen to this; he knew Hagrid would hate to be
overheard in a situation like this (he certainly would have) - if it had been possible
he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly, but that wasn't really
an option. Instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling along the stone
reindeer's back, but the beetle just wasn't interesting enough to block out Hagrid's
next words.
"I jus' knew . . . knew you were like me. . . . Was it yer mother or yer father?"
"I - I don't know what you mean, 'Agrid. ..."
"It was my mother," said Hagrid quietly. "She was one o' the las' ones in Britain.
'Course, I can' remember her too well. . . she left, see. When I was abou' three. She
wasn' really the maternal sort. Well. . . it's not in their natures, is it? Dunno what
happened to her . . . might be dead fer all I know. ..."
Madame Maxime didn't say anything. And Harry, in spite of himself, took his eyes
off the beetle and looked over the top of the reindeer's antlers, listening. ... He had
never heard Hagrid talk about his childhood before.
"Me dad was broken-hearted when she wen'. Tiny little bloke, my dad was. By the
time I was six I could lift him up an' put him on top o' the dresser if he annoyed
me. Used ter make him laugh. . . ." Hagrid's deep voice broke. Madame Maxime
was listening, motionless, apparently staring at the silvery fountain. "Dad raised
me . . . but he died, o' course, jus' after I started school. Sorta had ter make me own
way after that. Dumbledore was a real help, mind. Very kind ter me, he was. . . ."
Hagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and blew his nose heavily.
277"So ... anyway . . . enough abou' me. What about you? Which side you got it on?"
But Madame Maxime had suddenly got to her feet.
"It is chilly," she said - but whatever the weather was doing, it was nowhere near
as cold as her voice. "I think I will go in now."
"Eh?" said Hagrid blankly. "No, don go! I've - I've never met another one before!"
"Anuzzer what, precisely?" said Madame Maxime, her tone icy.
Harry could have told Hagrid it was best not to answer; he stood there in the
shadows gritting his teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn't - but it was no good.
"Another half-giant, o' course!" said Hagrid.
"'Ow dare you!" shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice exploded through the
peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him. Harry heard Fleur and Roger fall out
of their rosebush. "I 'ave nevair been more insulted in my life! 'Alf-giant? Moi? I
'ave - I 'ave big bones!"
She stormed away; great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the air as she
passed, angrily pushing aside bushes. Hagrid was still sitting on the bench, staring
after her. It was much too dark to make out his expression. Then, after about a
minute, he stood up and strode away, not back to the castle, but off out into the
dark grounds in the direction of his cabin.
"C'mon," Harry said, very quietly to Ron. "Let's go. . . ."
But Ron didn't move.
"What's up?" said Harry, looking at him.
Ron looked around at Harry, his expression very serious indeed.
"Did you know?" he whispered. "About Hagrid being half-giant?"
"No," Harry said, shrugging. "So what?"
He knew immediately, from the look Ron was giving him, that he was once again
revealing his ignorance of the wizarding world. Brought up by the Dursleys, there
were many things that wizards took for granted that were revelations to Harry, but
these surprises had become fewer with each successive year. Now, however, he
could tell that most wizards would not have said "So what?" upon finding out that
one of their friends had a giantess for a mother.
"I'll explain inside," said Ron quietly, "c'mon. . .."
Fleur and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably into a more private clump of
bushes. Harry and Ron returned to the Great Hall. Parvati and Padma were now
sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of Beauxbatons boys, and Hermione
was once more dancing with Krum. Harry and Ron sat down at a table far
278removed from the dance floor.
"So?" Harry prompted Ron. "What's the problem with giants?"
"Well, they're . . . they're . . ." Ron struggled for words. ". . . not very nice," he
finished lamely.
"Who cares?" Harry said. "There's nothing wrong with Hagrid!"
"I know there isn't, but. . . blimey, no wonder he keeps it quiet," Ron said, shaking
his head. "I always thought he'd got in the way of a bad Engorgement Charm when
he was a kid or something. Didn't like to mention it. ..."
"But what's it matter if his mother was a giantess?" said Harry.
"Well... no one who knows him will care, 'cos they'll know he's not dangerous,"
said Ron slowly. "But. . . Harry, they're just vicious, giants. It's like Hagrid said,
it's in their natures, they're like trolls . . . they just like killing, everyone knows
that. There aren't any left in Britain now, though."
"What happened to them?"
"Well, they were dying out anyway, and then loads got themselves killed by
Aurors. There're supposed to be giants abroad, though. . . . They hide out in
mountains mostly. . . ."
"I don't know who Maxime thinks she's kidding," Harry said, watching Madame
Maxime sitting alone at the judges' table, looking very somber. "If Hagrid's half-
giant, she definitely is. Big bones . .. the only thing that's got bigger bones than her
is a dinosaur."
Harry and Ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in their corner, neither of
them having any inclination to dance. Harry tried not to watch Cho and Cedric too
much; it gave him a strong desire to kick something.
When the Weird Sisters finished playing at midnight, everyone gave them a last,
loud round of applause and started to wend their way into the entrance hall. Many
people were expressing the wish that the ball could have gone on longer, but Harry
was perfectly happy to be going to bed; as far as he was concerned, the evening
hadn't been much fun.
Out in the entrance hall, Harry and Ron saw Hermione saying good night to Krum
before he went back to the Durmstrang ship. She gave Ron a very cold look and
swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking. Harry and Ron followed
her, but halfway up the staircase Harry heard someone calling him.
"Hey-Harry!"
It was Cedric Diggory. Harry could see Cho waiting for him in the entrance hall
below.
279"Yeah?" said Harry coldly as Cedric ran up the stairs toward him.
Cedric looked as though he didn't want to say whatever it was in front of Ron, who
shrugged, looking bad-tempered, and continued to climb the stairs.
"Listen ..." Cedric lowered his voice as Ron disappeared. "I owe you one for
telling me about the dragons. You know that golden egg? Does yours wail when
you open it?"
"Yeah," said Harry.
"Well... take a bath, okay?"
"What?"
"Take a bath, and - er - take the egg with you, and - er - just mull things over in the
hot water. It'll help you think. . . . Trust me."
Harry stared at him.
"Tell you what," Cedric said, "use the prefects' bathroom. Fourth door to the left of
that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor. Password's 'pine fresh.' Gotta
go ... want to say good night -"
He grinned at Harry again and hurried back down the stairs to Cho.
Harry walked back to Gryffindor Tower alone. That had been extremely strange
advice. Why would a bath help him to work out what the wailing egg meant? Was
Cedric pulling his leg? Was he trying to make Harry look like a fool, so Cho
would like him even more by comparison?
The Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait hole.
Harry had to yell "Fairy lights!" before he woke them up, and when he did, they
were extremely irritated. He climbed into the common room and found Ron and
Hermione having a blazing row. Standing ten feet apart, they were bellowing at
each other, each scarlet in the face.
"Well, if you don't like it, you know what the solution is, don't you?" yelled
Hermione; her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and her face was
screwed up in anger.
"Oh yeah?" Ron yelled back. "What's that?"
"Next time there's a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last
resort!"
Ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as Hermione turned on her
heel and stormed up the girls' staircase to bed. Ron turned to look at Harry.
"Well," he sputtered, looking thunderstruck, "well - that just proves - completely
missed the point -"
280Harry didn't say anything. He liked being back on speaking terms with Ron too
much to speak his mind right now - but he somehow thought that Hermione had
gotten the point much better than Ron had.
281CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR - RITA SKEETER'S SCOOP
Everybody got up late on Boxing Day. The Gryffindor common room was much
quieter than it had been lately, many yawns punctuating the lazy conversations.
Hermione's hair was bushy again; she confessed to Harry that she had used liberal
amounts of Sleekeazy's Hair Potion on it for the ball, "but it's way too much bother
to do every day," she said matter-of-factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks
behind the ears.
Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss
their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal.
Ron and Harry wasted no time in telling Hermione about the conversation they
had overheard between Madame Maxime and Hagrid, but Hermione didn't seem to
find the news that Hagrid was a half-giant nearly as shocking as Ron did.
"Well, I thought he must be," she said, shrugging. "I knew he couldn't be pure
giant because they're about twenty feet tall. But honestly, all this hysteria about
giants. They can't all be horrible. . . . It's the same sort of prejudice that people
have toward werewolves. . . . It's just bigotry, isn't it?"
Ron looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly, but perhaps he
didn't want another row, because he contented himself with shaking his head
disbelievingly while Hermione wasn't looking.
It was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the first week
of the holidays. Everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that Christmas
was over - everybody except Harry, that is, who was starting (once again) to feel
slightly nervous.
The trouble was that February the twenty-fourth looked a lot closer from this side
of Christmas, and he still hadn't done anything about working out the clue inside
the golden egg. He therefore started taking the egg out of his trunk every time he
went up to the dormitory, opening it, and listening intently, hoping that this time it
would make some sense. He strained to think what the sound reminded him of,
apart from thirty musical saws, but he had never heard anything else like it. He
closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and opened it again to see if the sound had
changed, but it hadn't. He tried asking the egg questions, shouting over all the
wailing, but nothing happened. He even threw the egg across the room - though he
hadn't really expected that to help.
Harry had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given him, but his less-than-
friendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take his
help if he could avoid it. In any case, it seemed to him that if Cedric had really
wanted to give Harry a hand, he would have been a lot more explicit. He, Harry,
had told Cedric exactly what was coming in the first task - and Cedric's idea of a
282fair exchange had been to tell Harry to take a bath. Well, he didn't need that sort of
rubbishy help - not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in hand
with Cho, anyway. And so the first day of the new term arrived, and Harry set off
to lessons, weighed down with books, parchment, and quills as usual, but also with
the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his stomach, as though he were carrying that
around with him too.
Snow was still thick upon the grounds, and the greenhouse windows were covered
in condensation so thick that they couldn't see out of them in Herbology. Nobody
was looking forward to Care of Magical Creatures much in this weather, though as
Ron said, the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely, either by chasing
them, or blasting off so forcefully that Hagrid's cabin would catch fire.
When they arrived at Hagrid 's cabin, however, they found an elderly witch with
closely cropped gray hair and a very prominent chin standing before his front
door.
"Hurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago," she barked at them as they
struggled toward her through the snow.
"Who're you?" said Ron, staring at her. "Wheres Hagrid?"
"My name is Professor Grubbly-Plank," she said briskly. "I am your temporary
Care of Magical Creatures teacher."
"Where's Hagrid?" Harry repeated loudly.
"He is indisposed," said Professor Grubbly-Plank shortly.
Soft and unpleasant laughter reached Harrys ears. He turned; Draco Malfoy and
the rest of the Slytherins were joining the class. All of them looked gleeful, and
none of them looked surprised to see Professor Grubbly-Plank.
"This way, please," said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and she strode off around the
paddock where the Beauxbatons horses were shivering. Harry, Ron, and Hermione
followed her, looking back over their shoulders at Hagrid's cabin. All the curtains
were closed. Was Hagrid in there, alone and ill?
"What's wrong with Hagrid?" Harry said, hurrying to catch up with Professor
Grubbly-Plank.
"Never you mind," she said as though she thought he was being nosy.
"I do mind, though," said Harry hotly. "What's up with him?"
Professor Grubbly-Plank acted as though she couldn't hear him. She led them past
the paddock where the huge Beauxbatons horses were standing, huddled against
the cold, and toward a tree on the edge of the forest, where a large and beautiful
unicorn was tethered.
283Many of the girls "ooooohed!" at the sight of the unicorn.
"Oh it's so beautiful!" whispered Lavender Brown. "How did she get it? They're
supposed to be really hard to catch!"
The unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around look gray. It was
pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves and throwing back its horned
head.
"Boys keep back!" barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, throwing out an arm and
catching Harry hard in the chest. "They prefer the woman's touch, unicorns. Girls
to the front, and approach with care, come on, easy does it. ..."
She and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn, leaving the boys
standing near the paddock fence, watching. The moment Professor Grubbly-Plank
was out of earshot. Harry turned to Ron.
"What d'you reckons wrong with him? You don't think a skrewt - ?"
"Oh he hasn't been attacked, Potter, if that's what you're thinking," said Malfoy
softly. "No, he's just too ashamed to show his big, ugly face."
"What d'you mean?" said Harry sharply.
Malfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes and pulled out a folded page of
newsprint.
"There you go," he said. "Hate to break it to you. Potter. ..."
He smirked as Harry snatched the page, unfolded it, and read it, with Ron,
Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped with
a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.
DUMBLEDORE'S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry, has never been afraid to make controversial staff appointments, writes
Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. In September of this year, he hired Alastor
"Mad-Eye" Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense Against
the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows at the Ministry of
Magic, given Moody's well-known habit of attacking anybody who makes a
sudden movement in his presence. Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible
and kindly when set beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care of
Magical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, has
enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for him
by Dumbledore. Last year, however, Hagrid used his mysterious influence over
the headmaster to secure the additional post of Care of Magical Creatures teacher,
over the heads of many better-qualified candidates.
284An alarmingly large and ferocious-looking man, Hagrid has been using his
newfound authority to terrify the students in his care with a succession of horrific
creatures. While Dumbledore turns a blind eye, Hagrid has maimed several pupils
during a series of lessons that many admit to being "very frightening."
'I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent Crabbe got a bad bite off a
flobberworm," says Draco Malfoy, a fourth-year student. "We all hate Hagrid, but
we're just too scared to say anything."
Hagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation, however. In
conversation with a Daily Prophet reporter last month, he admitted breeding
creatures he has dubbed "Blast-Ended Skrewts," highly dangerous crosses between
manti-cores and fire-crabs. The creation of new breeds of magical creature is, of
course, an activity usually closely observed by the Department for the Regulation
and Control of Magical Creatures. Hagrid, however, considers himself to be above
such petty restrictions.
"I was just having some fun," he says, before hastily changing the subject.
As if this were not enough, the Daily Prophet has now unearthed evidence that
Hagrid is not - as he has always pretended - a pure-blood wizard. He is not, in fact,
even pure human. His mother, we can exclusively reveal, is none other than the
giantess Fridwulfa, whose whereabouts are currently unknown.
Bloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction by
warring amongst themselves during the last century. The handful that remained
joined the ranks of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and were responsible for some
of the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign of terror.
While many of the giants who served He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were killed
by Aurors working against the Dark Side, Fridwulfa was not among them. It is
possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still existing in foreign
mountain ranges. If his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any
guide, however, Frid-wulfa's son appears to have inherited her brutal nature.
In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the
boy who brought around You-Know-Who's fall from power - thereby driving
Hagrid's own mother, like the rest of You-Know-Who's supporters, into hiding.
Perhaps Harry Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend - but
Albus Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along with his
fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with part-giants.
Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging open.
"How did she find out?" he whispered.
But that wasn't what was bothering Harry.
"What d'you mean, 'we all hate Hagrid'?" Harry spat at Malfoy. "What's this
285rubbish about him" - he pointed at Crabbe - "getting a bad bite off a flobberworm?
They haven't even got teeth!"
Crabbe was sniggering, apparently very pleased with himself.
"Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf's teaching career," said Malfoy, his
eyes glinting. "Half-giant. . . and there was me thinking he'd just swallowed a
bottle of Skele-Gro when he was young. ... None of the mummies and daddies are
going to like this at all. ... They'll be worried he'll eat their kids, ha, ha. ..."
"You-"
"Are you paying attention over there?"
Professor Grubbly-Planks voice carried over to the boys; the girls were all
clustered around the unicorn now, stroking it. Harry was so angry that the Daily
Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn,
whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly-Plank was now enumerating in
a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too.
"I hope she stays, that woman!" said Parvati Patil when the lesson had ended and
they were all heading back to the castle for lunch. "That's more what I thought
Care of Magical Creatures would be like . . . proper creatures like unicorns, not
monsters. . . ."
"What about Hagrid?" Harry said angrily as they went up the steps.
"What about him?" said Parvati in a hard voice. "He can still be gamekeeper, can't
he?"
Parvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. He supposed that he ought
to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a good time all
the same. She was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made
arrangements to meet the boy from Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on the next
weekend trip.
"That was a really good lesson," said Hermione as they entered the Great Hall. "I
didn't know half the things Professor Grubbly-Plank told us about uni -"
"Look at this!" Harry snarled, and he shoved the Daily Prophet article under
Hermione's nose.
Hermione's mouth fell open as she read. Her reaction was exactly the same as
Ron's.
"How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out? You don't think Hagrid told her?"
"No," said Harry, leading the way over to the Gryffindor table and throwing
himself into a chair, furious. "He never even told us, did he? I reckon she was so
mad he wouldn't give her loads of horrible stuff about me, she went ferreting
286around to get him back."
"Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball," said Hermione
quietly.
"We'd have seen her in the garden!" said Ron. "Anyway, she's not supposed to
come into school anymore, Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her. . . ."
"Maybe she's got an Invisibility Cloak," said Harry, ladling chicken casserole onto
his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger. "Sort of thing she'd do, isn't it,
hide in bushes listening to people."
"Like you and Ron did, you mean," said Hermione.
"We weren't trying to hear him!" said Ron indignantly. "We didn't have any
choice! The stupid prat, talking about his giantess mother where anyone could
have heard him!"
"We've got to go and see him," said Harry. "This evening, after Divination. Tell
him we want him back . . . you do want him back?" he shot at Hermione.
"I - well, I'm not going to pretend it didn't make a nice change, having a proper
Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once - but I do want Hagrid back, of course I
do!" Hermione added hastily, quailing under Harry's furious stare.
So that evening after dinner, the three of them left the castle once more and went
down through the frozen grounds to Hagrid's cabin. They knocked, and Fang's
booming barks answered.
"Hagrid, it's us!" Harry shouted, pounding on the door. "Open up!"
Hagrid didn't answer. They could hear Fang scratching at the door, whining, but it
didn't open. They hammered on it for ten more minutes; Ron even went and
banged on one of the windows, but there was no response.
"What's he avoiding us for?" Hermione said when they had finally given up and
were walking back to the school. "He surely doesn't think we'd care about him
being half-giant?"
But it seemed that Hagrid did care. They didn't see a sign of him all week. He
didn't appear at the staff table at mealtimes, they didn't see him going about his
gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and Professor Grubbly-Plank continued to take
the Care of Magical Creatures classes. Malfoy was gloating at every possible
opportunity.
"Missing your half-breed pal?" he kept whispering to Harry whenever there was a
teacher around, so that he was safe from Harry's retaliation. "Missing the elephant-
man?"
There was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January. Hermione was very
287surprised that Harry was going to go.
"I just thought you'd want to take advantage of the common room being quiet,"
she said. "Really get to work on that egg."
"Oh I - I reckon I've got a pretty good idea what it's about now," Harry lied.
"Have you really?" said Hermione, looking impressed. "Well done!"
Harrys insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them. He still had five weeks
to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages. . . whereas if he went into
Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and get a chance to persuade him to come
back.
He, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday and set off through the
cold, wet grounds toward the gates. As they passed the Durmstrang ship moored in
the lake, they saw Viktor Krum emerge onto the deck, dressed in nothing but
swimming trunks. He was very skinny indeed, but apparently a lot tougher than he
looked, because he climbed up onto the side of the ship, stretched out his arms,
and dived, right into the lake.
"He's mad!" said Harry, staring at Krums dark head as it bobbed out into the
middle of the lake. "It must be freezing, it's January!"
"It's a lot colder where he comes from," said Hermione. "I suppose it feels quite
warm to him."
"Yeah, but there's still the giant squid," said Ron. He didn't sound anxious - if
anything, he sounded hopeful. Hermione noticed his tone of voice and frowned.
"He's really nice, you know," she said. "He's not at all like you'd think, coming
from Durmstrang. He likes it much better here, he told me."
Ron said nothing. He hadn't mentioned Viktor Krum since the ball, but Harry had
found a miniature arm under his bed on Boxing Day, which had looked very much
as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing Bulgarian
Quidditch robes.
Harry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagrid all the way down the slushy High
Street, and suggested a visit to the Three Broomsticks once he had ascertained that
Hagrid was not in any of the shops.
The pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at all the tables told
Harry that Hagrid wasn't there. Heart sinking, he went up to the bar with Ron and
Hermione, ordered three butterbeers from Madam Rosmerta, and thought gloomily
that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after
all.
"Doesn't he ever go into the office?" Hermione whispered suddenly. "Look!"
288She pointed into the mirror behind the bar, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman reflected
there, sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins. Bagman was talking
very fast in a low voice to the goblins, all of whom had their arms crossed and
were looking rather menacing.
It was indeed odd. Harry thought, that Bagman was here at the Three Broomsticks
on a weekend when there was no Triwizard event, and therefore no judging to be
done. He watched Bagman in the mirror. He was looking strained again, quite as
strained as he had that night in the forest before the Dark Mark had appeared. But
just then Bagman glanced over at the bar, saw Harry, and stood up.
"In a moment, in a moment!" Harry heard him say brusquely to the goblins, and
Bagman hurried through the pub toward Harry, his boyish grin back in place.
"Harry!" he said. "How are you? Been hoping to run into you! Everything going
all right?"
"Fine, thanks," said Harry.
"Wonder if I could have a quick, private word, Harry?" said Bagman eagerly.
"You couldn't give us a moment, you two, could you?"
"Er - okay," said Ron, and he and Hermione went off to find a table.
Bagman led Harry along the bar to the end furthest from Madam Rosmerta.
"Well, I just thought I'd congratulate you again on your splendid performance
against that Horntail, Harry," said Bagman. "Really superb."
"Thanks," said Harry, but he knew this couldn't be all that Bagman wanted to say,
because he could have congratulated Harry in front of Ron and Hermione.
Bagman didn't seem in any particular rush to spill the beans, though. Harry saw
him glance into the mirror over the bar at the goblins, who were all watching him
and Harry in silence through their dark, slanting eyes.
"Absolute nightmare," said Bagman to Harry in an undertone, noticing Harry
watching the goblins too. "Their English isn't too good . . . it's like being back with
all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup . . . but at least they used sign
language another human could recognize. This lot keep gabbling in Gobblede-
gook . . . and I only know one word of Gobbledegook. Bladvak. It means 'pickax.'
I don't like to use it in case they think I'm threatening them."
He gave a short, booming laugh.
"What do they want?" Harry said, noticing how the goblins were still watching
Bagman very closely.
"Er - well. . ." said Bagman, looking suddenly nervous. "They ... er ... they're
looking for Barty Crouch."
289"Why are they looking for him here?" said Harry. "He's at the Ministry in London,
isn't he?"
"Er ... as a matter of fact, I've no idea where he is," said Bagman. "He's sort of...
stopped coming to work. Been absent for a couple of weeks now. Young Percy,
his assistant, says he's ill. Apparently he's just been sending instructions in by owl.
But would you mind not mentioning that to anyone. Harry? Because Rita Skeeter's
still poking around everywhere she can, and I'm willing to bet she'd work up
Bartys illness into something sinister. Probably say he's gone missing like Bertha
Jorkins."
"Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins?" Harry asked.
"No," said Bagman, looking strained again. "I've got people looking, of course ..."
(About time, thought Harry) "and it's all very strange. She definitely arrived in
Albania, because she met her second cousin there. And then she left the cousin's
house to go south and see an aunt. . . and she seems to have vanished without trace
en route. Blowed if I can see where she's got to ... she doesn't seem the type to
elope, for instance . . . but still. . . . What are we doing, talking about goblins and
Bertha Jorkins? I really wanted to ask you" - he lowered his voice - "how are you
getting on with your golden egg?"
"Er . . . not bad," Harry said untruthfully.
Bagman seemed to know he wasn't being honest.
"Listen, Harry," he said (still in a very low voice), "I feel very bad about all this . .
. you were thrown into this tournament, you didn't volunteer for it... and if. . ." (his
voice was so quiet now, Harry had to lean closer to listen) "if I can help at all... a
prod in the right direction . . . I've taken a liking to you . . . the way you got past
that dragon! . . . well, just say the word."
Harry stared up into Bagman's round, rosy face and his wide, baby-blue eyes.
"We're supposed to work out the clues alone, aren't we?" he said, careful to keep
his voice casual and not sound as though he was accusing the head of the
Department of Magical Games and Sports of breaking the rules.
"Well. . . well, yes," said Bagman impatiently, "but - come on. Harry - we all want
a Hogwarts victory, don't we?"
"Have you offered Cedric help?" Harry said.
The smallest of frowns creased Bagman's smooth face. "No, I haven't," he said. "I
- well, like I say, I've taken a liking to you. Just thought I'd offer ..."
"Well, thanks," said Harry, "but I think I'm nearly there with the egg . . . couple
more days should crack it."
He wasn't entirely sure why he was refusing Bagman's help, except that Bagman
290was almost a stranger to him, and accepting his assistance would feel somehow
much more like cheating than asking advice from Ron, Hermione, or Sirius.
Bagman looked almost affronted, but couldn't say much more as Fred and George
turned up at that point.
"Hello, Mr. Bagman," said Fred brightly. "Can we buy you a drink?"
"Er . . . no," said Bagman, with a last disappointed glance at Harry, "no, thank you,
boys ..."
Fred and George looked quite as disappointed as Bagman, who was surveying
Harry as though he had let him down badly.
"Well, I must dash," he said. "Nice seeing you all. Good luck, Harry."
He hurried out of the pub. The goblins all slid off their chairs and exited after him.
Harry went to rejoin Ron and Hermione.
"What did he want?" Ron said, the moment Harry had sat down.
"He offered to help me with the golden egg," said Harry.
"He shouldn't be doing that!" said Hermione, looking very shocked. "He's one of
the judges! And anyway, you've already worked it out - haven't you?"
"Er . . . nearly," said Harry.
"Well, I don't think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was trying to
persuade you to cheat!" said Hermione, still looking deeply disapproving. "I hope
he's trying to help Cedric as much!"
"He's not, I asked," said Harry.
"Who cares if Diggorys getting help?" said Ron. Harry privately agreed.
"Those goblins didn't look very friendly," said Hermione, sipping her butterbeer.
"What were they doing here?"
"Looking for Crouch, according to Bagman," said Harry. "He's still ill. Hasn't been
into work."
"Maybe Percys poisoning him," said Ron. "Probably thinks if Crouch snuffs it
he'll be made head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation."
Hermione gave Ron a don't-joke-about-things-like-that look, and said, "Funny,
goblins looking for Mr. Crouch. . . . They'd normally deal with the Department for
the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures."
"Crouch can speak loads of different languages, though," said Harry. "Maybe they
need an interpreter."
291"Worrying about poor 'ickle goblins, now, are you?" Ron asked Hermione.
"Thinking of starting up S.P.U.G. or something? Society for the Protection of
Ugly Goblins?"
"Ha, ha, ha," said Hermione sarcastically. "Goblins don't need protection. Haven't
you been listening to what Professor Binns has been telling us about goblin
rebellions?"
"No," said Harry and Ron together.
"Well, the/re quite capable of dealing with wizards," said Hermione, taking
another sip of butterbeer. "They're very clever. They're not like house-elves, who
never stick up for themselves."
"Uh-oh," said Ron, staring at the door.
Rita Skeeter had just entered. She was wearing banana-yellow robes today; her
long nails were painted shocking pink, and she was accompanied by her paunchy
photographer. She bought drinks, and she and the photographer made their way
through the crowds to a table nearby. Harry, Ron, and Hermione glaring at her as
she approached. She was talking fast and looking very satisfied about something.
"... didn't seem very keen to talk to us, did he, Bozo? Now, why would that be, do
you think? And what's he doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway? Showing
them the sights . .. what nonsense ... he was always a bad liar. Reckon something's
up? Think we should do a bit of digging? 'Disgraced Ex-Head of Magical Games
and Sports, Ludo Bagman . . .' Snappy start to a sentence, Bozo - we just need to
find a story to fit it -"
"Trying to ruin someone else's life?" said Harry loudly.
A few people looked around. Rita Skeeter's eyes widened behind her jeweled
spectacles as she saw who had spoken.
"Harry!" she said, beaming. "How lovely! Why don't you come and join- ?"
"I wouldn't come near you with a ten-foot broomstick," said Harry furiously.
"What did you do that to Hagrid for, eh?"
Rita Skeeter raised her heavily penciled eyebrows.
"Our readers have a right to the truth, Harry. I am merely doing my-"
"Who cares if he's half-giant?" Harry shouted. "There's nothing wrong with him!"
The whole pub had gone very quiet. Madam Rosmerta was staring over from
behind the bar, apparently oblivious to the fact that the flagon she was filling with
mead was overflowing.
Rita Skeeters smile flickered very slightly, but she hitched it back almost at once;
she snapped open her crocodile-skin handbag, pulled out her Quick-Quotes Quill,
292and said, "How about giving me an interview about the Hagrid you know. Harry?
The man behind the muscles? Your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it.
Would you call him a father substitute?"
Hermione stood up very abruptly, her butterbeer clutched in her hand as though it
were a grenade.
"You horrible woman," she said, through gritted teeth, "you don't care, do you,
anything for a story, and anyone will do, wont they? Even Ludo Bagman -"
"Sit down, you silly little girl, and don't talk about things you don't understand,"
said Rita Skeeter coldly, her eyes hardening as they fell on Hermione. "I know
things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl... not that it needs it -"
she added, eyeing Hermione's bushy hair.
"Let's go," said Hermione, "c'mon. Harry - Ron . .."
They left; many people were staring at them as they went. Harry glanced back as
they reached the door. Rita Skeeter's Quick-Quotes Quill was out; it was zooming
backward and forward over a piece of parchment on the table.
"She'll be after you next, Hermione," said Ron in a low and worried voice as they
walked quickly back up the street.
"Let her try!" said Hermione defiantly; she was shaking with rage. "I'll show her!
Silly little girl, am I? Oh, I'll get her back for this. First Harry, then Hagrid ..."
"You don't want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter," said Ron nervously. "I'm serious,
Hermione, she'll dig up something on you -"
"My parents don't read the Daily Prophet. She can't scare me into hiding!" said
Hermione, now striding along so fast that it was all Harry and Ron could do to
keep up with her. The last time Harry had seen Hermione in a rage like this, she
had hit Draco Malfoy around the face. "And Hagrid isn't hiding anymore! He
should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him! Come on!"
Breaking into a run, she led them all the way back up the road, through the gates
flanked by winged boars, and up through the grounds to Hagrid's cabin.
The curtains were still drawn, and they could hear Fang barking as they
approached.
"Hagrid!" Hermione shouted, pounding on his front door. "Hagrid, that's enough!
We know you're in there! Nobody cares if your mum was a giantess, Hagrid! You
can't let that foul Skeeter woman do this to you! Hagrid, get out here, you're just
being -"
The door opened. Hermione said, "About t-!" and then stopped, very suddenly,
because she had found herself face-to-face, not with Hagrid, but with Albus
Dumbledore.
293"Good afternoon," he said pleasantly, smiling down at them.
"We-er-we wanted to see Hagrid," said Hermione in a rather small voice.
"Yes, I surmised as much," said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. "Why don't you
come in?"
"Oh . . . um ... okay," said Hermione.
She, Ron, and Harry went into the cabin; Fang launched himself upon Harry the
moment he entered, barking madly and trying to lick his ears. Harry fended off
Fang and looked around.
Hagrid was sitting at his table, where there were two large mugs of tea. He looked
a real mess. His face was blotchy, his eyes swollen, and he had gone to the other
extreme where his hair was concerned; far from trying to make it behave, it now
looked like a wig of tangled wire.
"Hi, Hagrid," said Harry.
Hagrid looked up.
"'Lo," he said in a very hoarse voice.
"More tea, I think," said Dumbledore, closing the door behind Harry, Ron, and
Hermione, drawing out his wand, and twiddling it; a revolving tea tray appeared in
midair along with a plate of cakes. Dumbledore magicked the tray onto the table,
and everybody sat down. There was a slight pause, and then Dumbledore said,
"Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting, Hagrid?"
Hermione went slightly pink, but Dumbledore smiled at her and continued,
"Hermione, Harry, and Ron still seem to want to know you, judging by the way
they were attempting to break down the door."
"Of course we still want to know you!" Harry said, staring at Hagrid. "You don't
think anything that Skeeter cow - sorry, Professor," he added quickly, looking at
Dumbledore.
"I have gone temporarily deaf and haven't any idea what you said. Harry," said
Dumbledore, twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling.
"Er-right," said Harry sheepishly. "I just meant-Hagrid, how could you think we'd
care what that-woman-wrote about you?"
Two fat tears leaked out of Hagrid's beetle-black eyes and fell slowly into his
tangled beard.
"Living proof of what I've been telling you, Hagrid," said Dumbledore, still
looking carefully up at the ceiling. "I have shown you the letters from the
countless parents who remember you from their own days here, telling me in no
uncertain terms that if I sacked you, they would have something to say about it -"
294"Not all of 'em," said Hagrid hoarsely. "Not all of 'em wan me ter stay."
"Really, Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal popularity, I'm afraid you will
be in this cabin for a very long time," said Dumbledore, now peering sternly over
his half-moon spectacles. "Not a week has passed since I became headmaster of
this school when I haven't had at least one owl complaining about the way I run it.
But what should I do? Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to
anybody?"
"Yeh - yeh're not half-giant!" said Hagrid croakily.
"Hagrid, look what I've got for relatives!" Harry said furiously. "Look at the
Dursleys!"
"An excellent point," said Professor Dumbledore. "My own brother, Aberforth,
was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat. It was all over the
papers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He held his head high and went
about his business as usual! Of course, I'm not entirely sure he can read, so that
may not have been bravery. . .."
"Come back and teach, Hagrid," said Hermione quietly, "please come back, we
really miss you."
Hagrid gulped. More tears leaked out down his cheeks and into his tangled beard.
Dumbledore stood up. "I refuse to accept your resignation, Hagrid, and I expect
you back at work on Monday," he said. "You will join me for breakfast at eight-
thirty in the Great Hall. No excuses. Good afternoon to you all."
Dumbledore left the cabin, pausing only to scratch Fangs ears. When the door had
shut behind him, Hagrid began to sob into his dustbin-lid-sized hands. Hermione
kept patting his arm, and at last, Hagrid looked up, his eyes very red indeed, and
said, "Great man, Dumbledore . . . great man . .."
"Yeah, he is," said Ron. "Can I have one of these cakes, Hagrid?"
"Help yerself," said Hagrid, wiping his eyes on the back of his hand. "Ar, he's
righ', o' course - yeh're all righ' . . .I bin stupid . .. my ol' dad woulda bin ashamed
o' the way I've bin behavin'...." More tears leaked out, but he wiped them away
more forcefully, and said, "Never shown you a picture of my old dad, have I?
Here..."
Hagrid got up, went over to his dresser, opened a drawer, and pulled out a picture
of a short wizard with Hagrid's crinkled black eyes, beaming as he sat on top of
Hagrid's shoulder. Hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall, judging by the apple
tree beside him, but his face was beardless, young, round, and smooth - he looked
hardly older than eleven.
"Tha was taken jus' after I got inter Hogwarts," Hagrid croaked. "Dad was dead
chuffed ... thought I migh' not be a wizard, see, 'cos me mum ... well, anyway.
295'Course, I never was great shakes at magic, really... but at least he never saw me
expelled. Died, see, in me second year. . . ."
"Dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after Dad went. Got me the
gamekeeper job . . . trusts people, he does. Gives 'em second chances ... tha's what
sets him apar' from other heads, see. He'll accept anyone at Hogwarts, s'long as
they've got the talent. Knows people can turn out okay even if their families weren'
... well... all tha' respectable. But some don understand that. There's some who'd
always hold it against yeh . . . there's some who'd even pretend they just had big
bones rather than stand up an' say - I am what I am, an' I'm not ashamed. 'Never be
ashamed,' my ol' dad used ter say, 'there's some who'll hold it against you, but
they're not worth botherin' with.' An' he was right. I've bin an idiot. I'm not
botherin' with her no more, I promise yeh that. Big bones . . . I'll give her big
bones."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another nervously; Harry would rather
have taken fifty Blast-Ended Skrewts for a walk than admit to Hagrid that he had
overheard him talking to Madame Maxime, but Hagrid was still talking,
apparently unaware that he had said anything odd.
"Yeh know wha, Harry?" he said, looking up from the photograph of his father, his
eyes very bright, "when I firs' met you, you reminded me o' me a bit. Mum an' Dad
gone, an' you was feelin' like yeh wouldn' fit in at Hogwarts, remember? Not sure
yeh were really up to it... an' now look at yeh, Harry! School champion!"
He looked at Harry for a moment and then said, very seriously, "Yeh know what
I'd love. Harry? I'd love yeh ter win, I really would. It'd show 'em all... yeh don'
have ter be pureblood ter do it. Yeh don have ter be ashamed of what yeh are. It'd
show 'em Dumbledore's the one who's got it righ', lettin' anyone in as long as they
can do magic. How you doin' with that egg, Harry?"
"Great," said Harry. "Really great."
Hagrid's miserable face broke into a wide, watery smile.
"Tha's my boy. . . you show 'em, Harry, you show 'em. Beat 'em all."
Lying to Hagrid wasn't quite like lying to anyone else. Harry went back to the
castle later that afternoon with Ron and Hermione, unable to banish the image of
the happy expression on Hagrid's whiskery face as he had imagined Harry winning
the tournament. The incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever on
Harrys conscience that evening, and by the time he had got into bed, he had made
up his mind - it was time to shelve his pride and see if Cedric's hint was worth
anything.
296CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE - THE EGG AND THE EYE
Harry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work out the secret of the
golden egg, he decided to do it at night, when he would be able to take as much
time as he wanted. Reluctant though he was to accept more favors from Cedric, he
also decided to use the prefects' bathroom; far fewer people were allowed in there,
so it was much less likely that he would be disturbed.
Harry planned his excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of bed and
out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once before, and
had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak would, of course, be
essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he would take the Marauders
Map, which, next to the cloak, was the most useful aid to rule-breaking Harry
owned. The map showed the whole of Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and
secret passageways and, most important of all, it revealed the people inside the
castle as minuscule, labeled dots, moving around the corridors, so that Harry
would be forewarned if somebody was approaching the bathroom.
On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the cloak, crept back
downstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him the
dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This time it was Ron who waited
outside to give the Fat Lady the password ("banana fritters"), "Good luck," Ron
muttered, climbing into the room as Harry crept out past him.
It was awkward moving under the cloak tonight, because Harry had the heavy egg
under one arm and the map held in front of his nose with the other. However, the
moonlit corridors were empty and silent, and by checking the map at strategic
intervals, Harry was able to ensure that he wouldn't run into anyone he wanted to
avoid. When he reached the statue of Boris the Bewildered, a lost-looking wizard
with his gloves on the wrong hands, he located the right door, leaned close to it,
and muttered the password, "Pine fresh," just as Cedric had told him.
The door creaked open. Harry slipped inside, bolted the door behind him, and
pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, looking around.
His immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a prefect just to be
able to use this bathroom. It was softly lit by a splendid candle-filled chandelier,
and everything was made of white marble, including what looked like an empty,
rectangular swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor. About a hundred
golden taps stood all around the pools edges, each with a differently colored Jewel
set into its handle. There was also a diving board. Long white linen curtains hung
at the windows; a large pile of fluffy white towels sat in a corner, and there was a
single golden-framed painting on the wall. It featured a blonde mermaid who
was fast asleep on a rock, her long hair over her face. It fluttered every time she
297snored.
Harry moved forward, looking around, his footsteps echoing off the walls.
Magnificent though the bathroom was - and quite keen though he was to try out a
few of those taps - now he was here he couldn't quite suppress the feeling that
Cedric might have been having him on. How on earth was this supposed to help
solve the mystery of the egg? Nevertheless, he put one of the Huffy towels, the
cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the swimming-pool-sized bath, then
knelt down and turned on a few of the taps.
He could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bubble bath mixed with the
water, though it wasn't bubble bath as Harry had ever experienced it. One tap
gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of footballs; another poured ice-white foam
so thick that Harry thought it would have supported his weight if he'd cared to test
it; a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the surface of the
water. Harry amused himself for awhile turning the taps on and off, particularly
enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of the water in large
arcs. Then, when the deep pool was full of hot water, foam, and bubbles, which
took a very short time considering its size, Harry turned off all the taps, pulled off
his pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown, and slid into the water.
It was so deep that his feet barely touched the bottom, and he actually did a couple
of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water, staring at the egg.
Highly enjoyable though it was to swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of
different-colored steam wafting all around him, no stroke of brilliance came to
him, no sudden burst of understanding.
Harry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet hands, and opened it. The
wailing, screeching sound filled the bathroom, echoing and reverberating off the
marble walls, but it sounded just as incomprehensible as ever, if not more so with
all the echoes. He snapped it shut again, worried that the sound would attract
Filch, wondering whether that hadn't been Cedric's plan - and then, making him
jump so badly that he dropped the egg, which clattered away across the bathroom
floor, someone spoke.
"I'd try putting it in the water, if I were you."
Harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock. He stood up,
sputtering, and saw the ghost of a very glum-looking girl sitting cross-legged on
top of one of the taps. It was Moaning Myrtle, who was usually to be heard
sobbing in the S-bend of a toilet three floors below.
"Myrtle!" Harry said in outrage, "I'm - I'm not wearing anything!"
The foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but he had a nasty feeling that
Myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he had
arrived.
"I closed my eyes when you got in," she said, blinking at him through her thick
298spectacles. "You haven't been to see me for ages."
"Yeah . . . well. . ." said Harry, bending his knees slightly, just to make absolutely
sure Myrtle couldn't see anything but his head, "I'm not supposed to come into
your bathroom, am I? It's a girls' one."
"You didn't used to care," said Myrtle miserably. "You used to be in there all the
time."
This was true, though only because Harry, Ron, and Hermione had found Myrtle's
out-of-order toilets a convenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in secret - a
forbidden potion that had turned him and Ron into living replicas of Crabbe and
Goyle for an hour, so that they could sneak into the Slytherin common room.
"I got told off for going in there." said Harry, which was half-true; Percy had once
caught him coming out of Myrtles bathroom. "I thought I'd better not come back
after that."
"Oh ... I see ..." said Myrtle, picking at a spot on her chin in a morose sort of way.
"Well... anyway... I'd try the egg in the water. That's what Cedric Diggory did."
"Have you been spying on him too?" said Harry indignantly. "What d'you do,
sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths?"
"Sometimes," said Myrtle, rather slyly, "but I've never come out to speak to
anyone before."
"I'm honored," said Harry darkly. "You keep your eyes shut!"
He made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting himself out of
the bath, wrapping the towel firmly around his waist, and going to retrieve the egg.
Once he was back in the water, Myrtle peered through her fingers and said, "Go
on, then . .. open it under the water!"
Harry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and opened it... and this time, it
did not wail. A gurgling song was coming out of it, a song whose words he
couldnt distinguish through the water.
"You need to put your head under too," said Myrtle, who seemed to be thoroughly
enjoying bossing him around. "Go on!"
Harry took a great breath and slid under the surface - and now, sitting on the
marble bottom of the bubble-filled bath, he heard a chorus of eerie voices singing
to him from the open egg in his hands:
"Come seek us where our voices sound,
We cannot sing above the ground,
And while you re searching, ponder this:
299Wove taken what you'll sorely miss,
An hour long you'll have to look,
And to recover what we took,
But past an hour- the prospect's black,
Too late, it's gone, it wont come back"
Harry let himself float back upward and broke the bubbly surface, shaking his hair
out of his eyes.
"Hear it?" said Myrtle.
"Yeah ... 'Come seek us where our voices sound .. .' and if I need persuading ...
hang on, I need to listen again...."
He sank back beneath the water. It took three more underwater renditions of the
egg's song before Harry had it memorized; then he trod water for a while, thinking
hard, while Myrtle sat and watched him.
"I've got to go and look for people who can't use their voices above the ground. . .
." he said slowly. "Er . . . who could that be?"
"Slow, aren't you?"
He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a dose of
PolyJuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat. Harry stared
around the bathroom, thinking ... if the voices could only be heard underwater,
then it made sense for them to belong to underwater creatures. He ran this theory
past Myrtle, who smirked at him.
"Well, thats what Diggory thought," she said. "He lay there talking to himself for
ages about it. Ages and ages . . . nearly all the bubbles had gone. ..."
"Underwater ..." Harry said slowly. "Myrtle . . . what lives in the lake, apart from
the giant squid?"
"Oh all sorts," she said. "I sometimes go down there . . . sometimes don't have any
choice, if someone flushes my toilet when I'm not expecting it...."
Trying not to think about Moaning Myrtle zooming down a pipe to the lake with
the contents of a toilet. Harry said, "Well, does anything in there have a human
voice? Hang on -"
Harry's eyes had fallen on the picture of the snoozing mermaid on the wall.
"Myrtle, there aren't merpeople in there, are there?"
"Oooh, very good," she said, her thick glasses twinkling, "it took Diggory much
longer than that! And that was with her awake too" - Myrtle jerked her head
300toward the mermaid with an expression of great dislike on her glum face -
"giggling and showing off and flashing her fins.. .."
"Thats it, isn't it?" said Harry excitedly. "The second tasks to go and find the
merpeople in the lake and ... and ..."
But he suddenly realized what he was saying, and he felt the excitement drain out
of him as though someone had just pulled a plug in his stomach. He wasn't a very
good swimmer; he'd never had much practice. Dudley had had lessons in his
youth, but Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, no doubt hoping that Harry would
drown one day, hadn't bothered to give him any. A couple of lengths of this bath
were all very well, but that lake was very large, and very deep . . . and merpeople
would surely live right at the bottom. . . .
"Myrtle," Harry said slowly, "how am I supposed to breathe?"
At this, Myrtle's eyes filled with sudden tears again.
"Tactless!" she muttered, groping in her robes for a handkerchief.
"What's tactless?" said Harry, bewildered.
"Talking about breathing in front of me!" she said shrilly, and her voice echoed
loudly around the bathroom. "When I can't. . . when I haven't. . . not for ages ..."
She buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly. Harry remembered
how touchy Myrtle had always been about being dead, but none of the other
ghosts he knew made such a fuss about it.
"Sorry," he said impatiently. "I didn't mean - I just forgot. . ."
"Oh yes, very easy to forget Myrtle's dead," said Myrtle, gulping, looking at him
out of swollen eyes. "Nobody missed me even when I was alive. Took them hours
and hours to find my body - I know, I was sitting there waiting for them. Olive
Hornby came into the bathroom - Are you in here again, sulking, Myrtle?' she
said, 'because Professor Dippet asked me to look for you -' And then she saw my
body . . . ooooh, she didn't forget it until her dying day, I made sure of that...
followed her around and reminded her, I did. I remember at her brother's wedding
-"
But Harry wasn't listening; he was thinking about the merpeople's song again.
"We've taken what you II sorely miss." That sounded as though they were going to
steal something of his, something he had to get back. What were they going to
take?
"--and then, of course, she went to the Ministry of Magic to stop me stalking her,
so I had to come back here and live in my toilet."
"Good," said Harry vaguely. "Well, I'm a lot further on than I was. . . . Shut your
eyes again, will you? I'm getting out."
301He retrieved the egg from the bottom of the bath, climbed out, dried himself, and
pulled on his pajamas and dressing gown again.
"Will you come and visit me in my bathroom again sometime?" Moaning Myrtle
asked mournfully as Harry picked up the Invisibility Cloak.
"Er . . . I'll try," Harry said, though privately thinking the only way he'd be visiting
Myrtle's bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got blocked. "See
you. Myrtle... thanks for your help."
"Bye, 'bye," she said gloomily, and as Harry put on the Invisibllity Cloak he saw
her zoom back up the tap.
Out in the dark corridor, Harry examined the Marauders Map to check that the
coast was still clear. Yes, the dots belonging to Filch and his cat, Mrs. Norris, were
safely in their office . .. nothing else seemed to be moving apart from Peeves,
though he was bouncing around the trophy room on the floor above. ... Harry had
taken his first step back toward Gryffindor Tower when something else on the
map caught his eye . . . something distinctly odd.
Peeves was not the only thing that was moving. A single dot was flitting around a
room in the bottom left-hand corner - Snapes office. But the dot wasn't labeled
"Severus Snape" ... it was Bartemius Crouch.
Harry stared at the dot. Mr. Crouch was supposed to be too ill to go to work or to
come to the Yule Ball - so what was he doing, sneaking into Hogwarts at one
o'clock in the morning? Harry watched closely as the dot moved around and
around the room, pausing here and there. ...
Harry hesitated, thinking . . . and then his curiosity got the better of him. He turned
and set off in the opposite direction toward the nearest staircase. He was going to
see what Crouch was up to.
Harry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible, though the faces in some of
the portraits still turned curiously at the squeak of a floorboard, the rustle of his
pajamas. He crept along the corridor below, pushed aside a tapestry about halfway
along, and proceeded down a narrower staircase, a shortcut that would take him
down two floors. He kept glancing down at the map, wondering ... It just didn't
seem in character, somehow, for correct, law-abiding Mr. Crouch to be sneaking
around somebody else's office this late at night....
And then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking about what he was doing, not
concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of Mr. Crouch, Harrys leg
suddenly sank right through the trick step Neville always forgot to jump. He gave
an ungainly wobble, and the golden egg, still damp from the bath, slipped from
under his arm. He lurched forward to try and catch it, but too late; the egg fell
down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every step - the
Invisibility Cloak slipped - Harry snatched at it, and the Marauder s Map fluttered
out of his hand and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in the step to above his knee,
302he couldn't reach it.
The golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the staircase, burst open,
and began wailing loudly in the corridor below. Harry pulled out his wand and
struggled to touch the Marauder s Map, to wipe it blank, but it was too far away to
reach -
Pulling the cloak back over himself Harry straightened up, listening hard with his
eyes screwed up with fear. . . and, almost immediately -
"PEEVES!"
It was the unmistakable hunting cry of Filch the caretaker. Harry could hear his
rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer, his wheezy voice raised in
fury.
"What's this racket? Wake up the whole castle, will you? I'll have you, Peeves, I'll
have you, you'll... and what is this?"
Filch's footsteps halted; there was a clink of metal on metal and the wailing
stopped - Filch had picked up the egg and closed it. Harry stood very still, one leg
still Jammed tightly in the magical step, listening. Any moment now, Filch was
going to pull aside the tapestry, expecting to see Peeves . . . and there would be no
Peeves ... but if he came up the stairs, he would spot the Marauder's Map . . . and
Invisibility Cloak or not, the map would show "Harry Potter" standing exactly
where he was.
"Egg?" Filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs. "My sweet!" - Mrs. Norris was
obviously with him - "This is a Triwizard clue! This belongs to a school
champion!"
Harry felt sick; his heart was hammering very fast -
"PEEVES!" Filch roared gleefully. "You've been stealing!"
He ripped back the tapestry below, and Harry saw his horrible, pouchy face and
bulging, pale eyes staring up the dark and (to Filch) deserted staircase.
"Hiding, are you?" he said softly. "I'm coming to get you, Peeves. . . . You've gone
and stolen a Triwizard clue, Peeves... . Dumbledore'll have you out of here for this,
you filthy, pilfering poltergeist. ..."
Filch started to climb the stairs, his scrawny, dust-colored cat at his heels. Mrs.
Morris's lamp-like eyes, so very like her masters, were fixed directly upon Harry.
He had had occasion before now to wonder whether the Invisibility Cloak worked
on cats. . . . Sick with apprehension, he watched Filch drawing nearer and nearer
in his old flannel dressing gown - he tried desperately to pull his trapped leg free,
but it merely sank a few more inches - any second now, Filch was going to spot
the map or walk right into him -
303"Filch? Whats going on?"
Filch stopped a few steps below Harry and turned. At the foot of the stairs stood
the only person who could make Harry's situation worse: Snape. He was wearing a
long gray nightshirt and he looked livid.
"Its Peeves, Professor," Filch whispered malevolently. "He threw this egg down
the stairs."
Snape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped beside Filch. Harry gritted his
teeth, convinced his loudly thumping heart would give him away at any second. . .
.
"Peeves?" said Snape softly, staring at the egg in Filch's hands. "But Peeves
couldn't get into my office. . . ."
"This egg was in your office. Professor?"
"Of course not," Snape snapped. "I heard banging and wailing -"
"Yes, Professor, that was the egg -"
"- I was coming to investigate -"
"- Peeves threw it. Professor -"
"- and when I passed my office, I saw that the torches were lit and a cupboard door
was ajar! Somebody has been searching it!"
But Peeves couldn't -"
"I know he couldn't, Filch!" Snape snapped again. "I seal my office with a spell
none but a wizard could break!" Snape looked up the stairs, straight through
Harry, and then down into the corridor below. "I want you to come and help me
search for the intruder, Filch."
"I - yes, Professor - but -"
Filch looked yearningly up the stairs, right through Harry, who could see that he
was very reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering Peeves. Go, Harry pleaded
with him silently, go with Snape . . . go. . . Mrs. Norris was peering around Filch's
legs.... Harry had the distinct impression that she could smell him.. . . Why had he
filled that bath with so much perfumed foam?
"The thing is, Professor," said Filch plaintively, "the headmaster will have to listen
to me this time. Peeves has been stealing from a student, it might be my chance to
get him thrown out of the castle once and for all -"
"Filch, I don't give a damn about that wretched poltergeist; it's my office that's -"
Clunk. Clunk. Clunk.
304Snape stopped talking very abruptly. He and Filch both looked down at the foot of
the stairs. Harry saw Mad-Eye Moody limp into sight through the narrow gap
between their heads. Moody was wearing his old traveling cloak over his
nightshirt and leaning on his staff as usual.
"Pajama party, is it?" he growled up the stairs.
"Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor," said Filch at once. "Peeves the
Poltergeist, throwing things around as usual - and then Professor Snape discovered
that someone had broken into his off -"
"Shut up!" Snape hissed to Filch.
Moody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Moodys magical eye
travel over Snape, and then, unmistakably, onto himself.
Harrys heart gave a horrible jolt. Moody could see through Invisibility Cloaks... he
alone could see the full strangeness of the scene:
Snape in his nightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, Harry, trapped in the stairs
behind them. Moody's lopsided gash of a mouth opened in surprise. For a few
seconds, he and Harry stared straight into each other's eyes. Then Moody closed
his mouth and turned his blue eye upon Snape again.
"Did I hear that correctly, Snape?" he asked slowly. "Someone broke into your
office?"
"It is unimportant," said Snape coldly. "On the contrary," growled Moody, "it is
very important. Who'd want to break into your office?"
"A student, I daresay," said Snape. Harry could see a vein flickering horribly on
Snape's greasy temple. "It has happened before. Potion ingredients have gone
missing from my private store cupboard ... students attempting illicit mixtures, no
doubt...."
"Reckon they were after potion ingredients, eh?" said Moody. "Not hiding
anything else in your office, are you?"
Harry saw the edge of Snapes sallow face turn a nasty brick color, the vein in his
temple pulsing more rapidly.
"You know I'm hiding nothing, Moody," he said in a soft and dangerous voice, "as
you've searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself."
Moodys face twisted into a smile. "Auror's privilege, Snape. Dumbledore told me
to keep an eye -"
"Dumbledore happens to trust me," said Snape through clenched teeth. "I refuse to
believe that he gave you orders to search my office!"
"Course Dumbledore trusts you," growled Moody. "Hes a trusting man, isn't he?
305Believes in second chances. But me - I say there are spots that don't come off,
Snape. Spots that never come off, d'you know what I mean?"
Snape suddenly did something very strange. He seized his left forearm
convulsively with his right hand, as though something on it had hurt him.
Moody laughed. "Get back to bed, Snape."
"You don't have the authority to send me anywhere!" Snape hissed, letting go of
his arm as though angry with himself. "I have as much right to prowl this school
after dark as you do!"
"Prowl away," said Moody, but his voice was full of menace. "I look forward to
meeting you in a dark corridor some time.... You've dropped something, by the
way. ..."
With a stab of horror. Harry saw Moody point at the Marauders Map, still lying on
the staircase six steps below him. As Snape and Filch both turned to look at it,
Harry threw caution to the winds; he raised his arms under the cloak and waved
furiously at Moody to attract his attention, mouthing "It's mine! Mine!"
Snape had reached out for it, a horrible expression of dawning comprehension on
his face -
"Accio Parchment!"
The map flew up into the air, slipped through Snapes outstretched fingers, and
soared down the stairs into Moodys hand.
"My mistake," Moody said calmly. "It's mine - must've dropped it earlier -"
But Snape's black eyes were darting from the egg in Filch's arms to the map in
Moodys hand, and Harry could tell he was putting two and two together, as only
Snape could. . . .
"Potter," he said quietly.
"What's that?" said Moody calmly, folding up the map and pocketing it.
"Potter!" Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at the
place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him. "That egg is Potters
egg. That piece of parchment belongs to Potter. I have seen it before, I recognize
it! Potter is here! Potter, in his Invisibility Cloak!"
Snape stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to move up the stairs;
Harry could have sworn his over-large nostrils were dilating, trying to sniff Harry
out - trapped. Harry leaned backward, trying to avoid Snapes fingertips, but any
moment now-
"There's nothing there, Snape!" barked Moody, "but I'll be happy to tell the
headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to Harry Potter!"
306"Meaning what?" Snape turned again to look at Moody, his hands still
outstretched, inches from Harry's chest.
"Meaning that Dumbledore's very interested to know who's got it in for that boy!"
said Moody, limping nearer still to the foot of the stairs. "And so am I, Snape . . .
very interested...." The torchlight flickered across his mangled face, so that the
scars, and the chunk missing from
his nose, looked deeper and darker than ever.
Snape was looking down at Moody, and Harry couldn't see the expression on his
face. For a moment, nobody moved or said anything. Then Snape slowly lowered
his hands.
"I merely thought," said Snape, in a voice of forced calm, "that if Potter was
wandering around after hours again ... it's an unfortunate habit of his ... he should
be stopped. For - for his own safety."
"Ah, I see," said Moody softly. "Got Potter's best interests at heart, have you?"
There was a pause. Snape and Moody were still staring at each other, Mrs. Norris
gave a loud meow, still peering around Filch's legs, looking for the source of
Harry's bubble-bath smell.
"I think I will go back to bed," Snape said curtly.
"Best idea you've had all night," said Moody. "Now, Filch, if you'll just give me
that egg-"
"No!" said Filch, clutching the egg as though it were his firstborn son. "Professor
Moody, this is evidence of Peeves' treachery!"
"It's the property of the champion he stole it from," said Moody. Hand it over,
now."
Snape swept downstairs and passed Moody without another word. Filch made a
chirruping noise to Mrs. Norris, who stared blankly at Harry for a few more
seconds before turning and following her master. Still breathing very fast. Harry
heard Snape walking away down the corridor; Filch handed Moody the egg and
disappeared from view too, muttering to Mrs. Norris. "Never mind. my sweet.. .
we'll see Dumbledore in the morning ... tell him what Peeves was up to...."
A door slammed. Harry was left staring down at Moody, who placed his staff on
the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him, a dull clunk on
every other step.
"Close shave. Potter," he muttered.
"Yeah ... I - er ... thanks," said Harry weakly.
"What is this thing?" said Moody, drawing the Marauder's Map out of his pocket
307and unfolding it.
"Map of Hogwarts," said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out of the
staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
"Merlins beard," Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye going
haywire. "This . .. this is some map. Potter!"
"Yeah, its . . . quite useful," Harry said. His eyes were starting to water from the
pain. "Er - Professor Moody, d'you think you could help me - ?"
"What? Oh! Yes . . . yes, of course . .."
Moody took hold of Harrys arms and pulled; Harrys leg came free of the trick
step, and he climbed onto the one above it. Moody was still gazing at the map.
"Potter ..." he said slowly, "you didn't happen, by any chance, to see who broke
into Snapes office, did you? On this map, I mean?"
"Er . . . yeah, I did . . ." Harry admitted. "It was Mr. Crouch."
Moodys magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map. He looked
suddenly alarmed.
"Crouch?" he said. "You're - you're sure. Potter?"
"Positive," said Harry.
"Well, he's not here anymore," said Moody, his eye still whizzing over the map.
"Crouch . .. that's very - very interesting... ."
He said nothing for almost a minute, still staring at the map. Harry could tell that
this news meant something to Moody and very much wanted to know what it was.
He wondered whether he dared ask. Moody scared him slightly. . . yet Moody had
just helped him avoid an awful lot of trouble. . . .
"Er ... Professor Moody . . . why d'you reckon Mr. Crouch wanted to look around
Snapes office?"
Moodys magical eye left the map and fixed, quivering, upon Harry. It was a
penetrating glare, and Harry had the impression that Moody was sizing him up,
wondering whether to answer or not, or how much to tell him.
"Put it this way. Potter," Moody muttered finally, "they say old Mad-Eye's
obsessed with catching Dark wizards . . . but I'm nothing - nothing - compared to
Barty Crouch."
He continued to stare at the map. Harry was burning to know more.
"Professor Moody?" he said again. "D'you think... could this have anything to do
with . . . maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there's something going on. ..."
308"Like what?" said Moody sharply.
Harry wondered how much he dare say. He didn't want Moody to guess that he
had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to tricky questions
about Sirius.
"I don't know," Harry muttered, "odd stuffs been happening lately, hasn't it? It's
been in the Daily Prophet... the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the Death Eaters
and everything...."
Both of Moody's mismatched eyes widened.
"You're a sharp boy. Potter," he said. His magical eye roved back to the
Marauder's Map. "Crouch could be thinking along those lines," he said slowly.
"Very possible. . . there have been some funny rumors flying around lately -
helped along by Rita Skeeter, of course. It's making a lot of people nervous, I
reckon." A grim smile twisted his lopsided mouth. "Oh if there's one thing I hate,"
he muttered, more to himself than to Harry, and his magical eye was fixed on the
left-hand corner of the map, "its a Death Eater who walked free. ..."
Harry stared at him. Could Moody possibly mean what Harry thought he meant?
"And now I want to ask you a question. Potter," said Moody in a more
businesslike tone.
Harrys heart sank; he had thought this was coming. Moody was going to ask
where he had got this map, which was a very dubious magical object - and the
story of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated not only him, but his own
father, Fred and George Weasley, and Professor Lupin, their last Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher. Moody waved the map in front of Harry, who braced
himself-
"Can I borrow this?"
"Oh!" said Harry.
He was very fond of his map, but on the other hand, he was extremely relieved
that Moody wasn't asking where he'd got it, and there was no doubt that he owed
Moody a favor.
"Yeah, okay."
"Good boy," growled Moody. "I can make good use of this . .. this might be
exactly what I've been looking for. . . . Right, bed, Potter, come on, now. ..."
They climbed to the top of the stairs together, Moody still examining the map as
though it was a treasure the like of which he had never seen before. They walked
in silence to the door of Moody's office, where he stopped and looked up at Harry.
"You ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter?"
309"No," said Harry, taken aback.
"You want to consider it," said Moody, nodding and looking at Harry thoughtfully.
"Yes, indeed ... and incidentally ... I'm guessing you werent Just taking that egg for
a walk tonight?"
"Er - no," said Harry, grinning. "I've been working out the clue."
Moody winked at him, his magical eye going haywire again. "Nothing like a
nighttime stroll to give you ideas, Potter. . .. See you in the morning...."
He went back into his office, staring down at the Marauders Map again, and closed
the door behind him.
Harry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in thought about Snape, and
Crouch, and what it all meant.... Why was Crouch pretending to be ill, if he could
manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to? What did he think Snape was
concealing in his office?
And Moody thought he. Harry, ought to be an Auror! Interesting idea.. . but
somehow. Harry thought, as he got quietly into his four-poster ten minutes later,
the egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk, he thought he'd like to check
how scarred the rest of them were before he chose it as a career.
310CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX - THE SECOND TASK
You said you'd already worked out that egg clue!" said Hermione indignantly.
"Keep your voice down!" said Harry crossly. "I just need to - sort of fine-tune it,
all right?"
He, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a
table to themselves. They were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the
Summoning Charm today - the Banishing Charm. Owing to the potential for nasty
accidents when objects kept flying across the room. Professor Flitwick had given
each student a stack of cushions on which to practice, the theory being that these
wouldn't hurt anyone if they went off target. It was a good theory, but it wasn't
working very well. Neville's aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending
much heavier things flying across the room - Professor Flitwick, for instance.
"Just forget the egg for a minute, all right?" Harry hissed as Professor Flitwick
went whizzing resignedly past them, landing on top of a large cabinet. "I'm trying
to tell you about Snape and Moody. ..."
This class was an ideal cover for a private conversation, as everyone was having
far too much fun to pay them any attention. Harry had been recounting his
adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour.
"Snape said Moodys searched his office as well?" Ron whispered, his eyes alight
with interest as he Banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand (it soared into the
air and knocked Parvati's hat off). "What. . . d'you reckon Moody's here to keep an
eye on Snape as well as Karkaroff?"
"Well, I dunno if that's what Dumbledore asked him to do, but he's definitely
doing it," said Harry, waving his wand without paying much attention, so that his
cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk. "Moody said Dumbledore only
lets Snape stay here because he's giving him a second chance or something. ..."
"What?" said Ron, his eyes widening, his next cushion spinning high into the air,
ricocheting off the chandelier, and dropping heavily onto Flitwick's desk. "Harry...
maybe Moody thinks Snape put your name in the Goblet of Fire!"
"Oh Ron," said Hermione, shaking her head sceptically, "we thought Snape was
trying to kill Harry before, and it turned out he was saving Harry's life,
remember?"
She Banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they
were all supposed to be aiming at. Harry looked at Hermione, thinking... it was
true that Snape had saved his life once, but the odd thing was, Snape definitely
loathed him, just as he'd loathed Harry s father when they had been at school
together. Snape loved taking points from Harry, and had certainly never missed an
opportunity to give him punishments, or even to suggest that he should be
311suspended from the school.
"I don't care what Moody says," Hermione went on. "Dumbledore's not stupid. He
was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin, even though loads of people
wouldn't have given them jobs, so why shouldn't he be right about Snape, even if
Snape is a bit -"
"- evil," said Ron promptly. "Come on, Hermione, why are all these Dark wizard
catchers searching his office, then?"
"Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill?" said Hermione, ignoring Ron.
"Its a bit funny, isn't it, that he cant manage to come to the Yule Ball, but he can
get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to?"
"You just don't like Crouch because of that elf, Winky," said Ron, sending a
cushion soaring into the window.
"You just want to think Snapes up to something," said Hermione, sending her
cushion zooming neatly into the box.
"I just want to know what Snape did with his first chance, if he's on his second
one," said Harry grimly, and his cushion, to his very great surprise, flew straight
across the room and landed neatly on top of Hermione's.
Obedient to Sirius's wish of hearing about anything odd at Hogwarts, Harry sent
him a letter by brown owl that night, explaining all about Mr. Crouch breaking
into Snape s office, and Moody and Snape's conversation. Then Harry turned his
attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him: how to survive
underwater for an hour on the twenty-fourth of February.
Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again - Harry had
explained about Aqua-Lungs, and Ron couldn't see why Harry shouldn't Summon
one from the nearest Muggle town. Hermione squashed this plan by pointing out
that, in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to operate an Aqua-
Lung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be disqualified for breaking
the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy - it was too much to hope that no
Muggles would spot an Aqua-Lung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts.
"Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a
submarine or something," Hermione said. "If only we'd done human
Transfiguration already! But I don't think we start that until sixth year, and it can
go badly wrong if you don't know what you're doing...."
"Yeah, I don't fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head,"
said Harry. "I s'pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody; he might
do it for me...."
"I don't think he'd let you choose what you wanted to be turned into, though," said
Hermione seriously. "No, I think your best chance is some sort of charm."
312So Harry, thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a
lifetime, buried himself once more among the dusty volumes, looking for any spell
that might enable a human to survive without oxygen. However, though he, Ron,
and Hermione searched through their lunchtimes, evenings, and whole weekends -
though Harry asked Professor McGonagall for a note of permission to use the
Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable, vulture-like librarian. Madam
Pince, for help - they found nothing whatsoever that would enable Harry to spend
an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.
Familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb Harry now, and he was
finding it difficult to concentrate in class again. The lake, which Harry had always
taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds, drew his eyes whenever he
was near a classroom window, a great, iron-gray mass of chilly water, whose dark
and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon.
Just as it had before he faced the Horntail, time was slipping away as though
somebody had bewitched the clocks to go extra-fast. There was a week to go
before February the twenty-fourth (there was still time) . . . there were five days to
go (he was bound to find something soon) .. . three days to go (please let me find
something... please). . .
With two days left. Harry started to go off food again. The only good thing about
breakfast on Monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to Sirius. He
pulled off the parchment, unrolled it, and saw the shortest letter Sirius had ever
written to him.
Send date of next Hogsmeade weekend by return owl.
Harry turned the parchment over and looked at the back, hoping to see something
else, but it was blank.
"Weekend after next," whispered Hermione, who had read the note over Harrys
shoulder. "Here - take my quill and send this owl back straight away."
Harry scribbled the dates down on the back of Sirius's letter, tied it onto the brown
owl's leg, and watched it take flight again. What had he expected? Advice on how
to survive underwater? He had been so intent on telling Sirius all about Snape and
Moody he had completely forgotten to mention the eggs clue.
"What's he want to know about the next Hogsmeade weekend for?" said Ron.
"Dunno," said Harry dully. The momentary happiness that had flared inside him at
the sight of the owl had died. "Come on ...Care of Magical Creatures."
Whether Hagrid was trying to make up for the Blast-Ended Skrewts, or because
there were now only two skrewts left, or because he was trying to prove he could
do anything that Professor Grubbly-Plank could. Harry didnt know, but Hagrid
had been continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since he'd returned to work. It
turned out that Hagrid knew quite as much about unicorns as he did about
313monsters, though it was clear that he found their lack of poisonous fangs
disappointing.
Today he had managed to capture two unicorn foals. Unlike full-grown unicorns,
they were pure gold. Parvati and Lavender went into transports of delight at the
sight of them, and even Pansy Parkinson had to work hard to conceal how much
she liked them.
"Easier ter spot than the adults," Hagrid told the class. "They turn silver when
they're abou' two years old, an' they grow horns at aroun four. Don' go pure white
till they're full grown, 'round about seven. They're a bit more trustin when they're
babies .. . don mind boys so much.... C'mon, move in a bit, yeh can pat 'em if yeh
want. . . give 'em a few o' these sugar lumps. . . .
"You okay. Harry?" Hagrid muttered, moving aside slightly, while most of the
others swarmed around the baby unicorns.
"Yeah," said Harry. "Jus' nervous, eh?" said Hagrid.
"Bit," said Harry.
"Harry," said Hagrid, clapping a massive hand on his shoulder, so that Harry's
knees buckled under its weight, "I'd've bin worried before I saw yeh take on tha
Horntail, but I know now yeh can do anythin' yeh set yer mind ter. I'm not worried
at all. Yeh're goin ter be fine. Got yer clue worked out, haven' yeh?"
Harry nodded, but even as he did so, an insane urge to confess that he didn't have
any idea how to survive at the bottom of the lake for an hour came over him. He
looked up at Hagrid - perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes, to deal with
the creatures in it? He looked after everything else on the grounds, after all-
"Yeh're goin' ter win," Hagrid growled, patting Harrys shoulder again, so that
Harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the soft ground. "I know it.
I can feel it. Yeh're goin' ter win, Harry n
Harry just couldn't bring himself to wipe the happy, confident smile off Hagrid's
face. Pretending he was interested in the young unicorns, he forced a smile in
return, and moved forward to pat them with the others.
By the evening before the second task. Harry felt as though he were trapped in a
nightmare. He was fully aware that even if, by some miracle, he managed to find a
suitable spell, he'd have a real job mastering it overnight. How could he have let
this happen? Why hadn't he got to work on the egg's clue sooner? Why had he
ever let his mind wander in class - what if a teacher had once mentioned how to
breathe underwater?
He sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside, tearing
feverishly through page after page of spells, hidden from one another by the
massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them. Harry s heart gave a
314huge leap every time he saw the word "water" on a page, but more often than not it
was merely "Take two pints of water, half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves,
and a newt..."
"I don't reckon it can be done," said Rons voice flatly from the other side of the
table. "There's nothing. Nothing. Closest was that thing to dry up puddles and
ponds, that Drought Charm, but that was nowhere near powerful enough to drain
the lake."
"There must be something," Hermione muttered, moving a candle closer to her.
Her eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of Olde and Forgotten
Bewitchments and Charmes with her nose about an inch from the page. "They'd
never have set a task that was undoable."
"They have," said Ron. "Harry, just go down to the lake tomorrow, right, stick
your head in, yell at the merpeople to give back whatever they've nicked, and see
if they chuck it out. Best you can do, mate."
"There's a way of doing it!" Hermione said crossly. "There Just has to be!"
She seemed to be taking the library's lack of useful information on the subject as a
personal insult; it had never failed her before.
"I know what I should have done," said Harry, resting, face-down, on Saucy
Tricks for Tricky Sorts. "I should've learned to be an Animagus like Sirius."
An Animagus was a wizard who could transform into an animal.
"Yeah, you could've turned into a goldfish any time you wanted!" said Ron.
"Or a frog," yawned Harry. He was exhausted. "It takes years to become an
Animagus, and then you have to register yourself and everything," said Hermione
vaguely, now squinting down the index of Weird Wizarding Dilemmas and Their
Solutions. "Professor McGonagall told us, remember... you've got to register
yourself with the Improper Use of Magic Office ...what animal you become, and
your markings, so you can't abuse it..."
"Hermione, I was joking," said Harry wearily. "I know I haven't got a chance of
turning into a frog by tomorrow morning...."
"Oh this is no use," Hermione said, snapping shut Weird Wizarding Dilemmas.
"Who on earth wants to make their nose hair grow into ringlets?"
"I wouldn't mind," said Fred Weasleys voice. "Be a talking point, wouldn't it?"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked up. Fred and George had just emerged from
behind some bookshelves.
"What're you two doing here?" Ron asked.
"Looking for you," said George. "McGonagall wants you, Ron. And you,
315Hermione."
"Why?" said Hermione, looking surprised.
"Dunno ... she was looking a bit grim, though," said Fred.
"We're supposed to take you down to her office," said George.
Ron and Hermione stared at Harry, who felt his stomach drop. Was Professor
McGonagall about to tell Ron and Hermione off? Perhaps she'd noticed how much
they were helping him, when he ought to be working out how to do the task alone?
"We'll meet you back in the common room," Hermione told Harry as she got up to
go with Ron - both of them looked very anxious. "Bring as many of these books as
you can, okay?"
"Right," said Harry uneasily.
By eight o'clock. Madam Pince had extinguished all the lamps and came to chivvy
Harry out of the library. Staggering under the weight of as many books as he could
carry, Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room, pulled a table into a corner,
and continued to search. There was nothing in Madcap Magic for Wacky
Warlocks. . . nothing in A Guide to Medieval Sorcery . . . not one mention of
underwater exploits in An Anthology of Eighteenth-Century Charms, or in
Dreadful Denizens of the Deep, or Powers You Never Knew You Had and What
to Do with Them Now Youve Wised Up.
Crookshanks crawled into Harrys lap and curled up, purring deeply. The common
room emptied slowly around Harry. People kept wishing him luck for the next
morning in cheery, confident voices like Hagrid s, all of them apparently
convinced that he was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one
he had managed in the first task. Harry couldn't answer them, he just nodded,
feeling as though there were a golfball stuck in his throat. By ten to midnight, he
was alone in the room with Crookshanks. He had searched all the remaining
books, and Ron and Hermione had not come back.
It's over, he told himself. You can't do it. You'll just have to go down to the lake in
the morning and tell the judges....
He imagined himself explaining that he couldn't do the task. He pictured Bagman's
look of round-eyed surprise, Karkaroffs satisfied, yellow-toothed smile. He could
almost hear Fleur Delacour saying "I knew it. . . 'e is too young, 'e is only a little
boy." He saw Malfoy flashing his POTTER STINKS badge at the front of the
crowd, saw Hagrid s crestfallen, disbelieving face. . . .
Forgetting that Crookshanks was on his lap. Harry stood up very suddenly;
Crookshanks hissed angrily as he landed on the floor, gave Harry a disgusted look,
and stalked away with his bottlebrush tail in the air, but Harry was already
hurrying up the spiral staircase to his dormitory. ... He would grab the Invisibility
316Cloak and go back to the library, he'd stay there all night if he had to. ...
"Lumos," Harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he opened the library door.
Wand tip alight, he crept along the bookshelves, pulling down more books - books
of hexes and charms, books on merpeople and water monsters, books on famous
witches and wizards, on magical inventions, on anything at all that might include
one passing reference to underwater survival. He carried them over to a table, then
set to work, searching them by the narrow beam of his wand, occasionally
checking his watch. . . .
One in the morning. . . two in the morning . . . the only way he could keep going
was to tell himself, over and over again, next book. . . in the next one. . . the next
one. . .
The mermaid in the painting in the prefects' bathroom was laughing. Harry was
bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her rock, while she held his Firebolt
over his head.
"Come and get it!" she giggled maliciously. "Come on, jump!"
"I can't," Harry panted, snatching at the Firebolt, and struggling not to sink. "Give
it to me!"
But she just poked him painfully in the side with the end of the broomstick,
laughing at him.
"That hurts - get off- ouch -"
"Harry Potter must wake up, sir!"
"Stop poking me -"
"Dobby must poke Harry Potter, sir, he must wake up!"
Harry opened his eyes. He was still in the library; the Invisibility Cloak had
slipped off his head as he'd slept, and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of
Where There's a Wand, There's a Way. He sat up, straightening his glasses,
blinking in the bright daylight.
"Harry Potter needs to hurry!" squeaked Dobby. "The second task starts in ten
minutes, and Harry Potter -"
"Ten minutes?" Harry croaked. "Ten - ten minutes?"
He looked down at his watch. Dobby was right. It was twenty past nine. A large,
dead weight seemed to fall through Harry's chest into his stomach.
"Hurry, Harry Potter!" squeaked Dobby, plucking at Harry's sleeve. "You is
supposed to be down by the lake with the other champions, sir!"
317"It's too late, Dobby," Harry said hopelessly. "I'm not doing the task, I don't know
how-"
"Harry Potter will do the task!" squeaked the elf. "Dobby knew Harry had not
found the right book, so Dobby did it for him!"
"What?" said Harry. "But you don't know what the second task is -"
"Dobby knows, sir! Harry Potter has to go into the lake and find his Wheezy -"
"Find my what?"
"- and take his Wheezy back from the merpeople!"
"What's a Wheezy?"
"Your Wheezy, sir, your Wheezy-Wheezy who is giving Dobby his sweater!"
Dobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he was now wearing over his
shorts.
"What?" Harry gasped. "They've got. . . they've got Ron?"
"The thing Harry Potter will miss most, sir!" squeaked Dobby. "'But past an hour-
'"
"- 'the prospect's black,'" Harry recited, staring, horror-struck, at the elf. " 'Too
late, it's gone, it won't come back.' Dobby - what've I got to do?"
"You has to eat this, sir!" s queaked the elf, and he put his hand in the pocket of
his shorts and drew out a ball of what looked like slimy, grayish-green rat tails.
"Right before you go into the lake, sir - gillyweed!"
"What's it do?" said Harry, staring at the gillyweed.
"It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!"
"Dobby," said Harry frantically, "listen - are you sure about this?"
He couldn't quite forget that the last time Dobby had tried to "help" him, he had
ended up with no bones in his right arm.
"Dobby is quite sure, sir!" said the elf earnestly. "Dobby hears things, sir, he is a
house-elf, he goes all over the castle as he lights the fires and mops the floors.
Dobby heard Professor McGonagall and Professor Moody in the staffroom,
talking about the next task. . . . Dobby cannot let Harry Potter lose his Wheezy!"
Harrys doubts vanished. Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak,
stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then tore
out of the library with Dobby at his heels.
"Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!" Dobby squealed as they burst into
318the corridor. "Dobby will be missed - good luck, Harry Potter, sir, good luck!"
"See you later, Dobby!" Harry shouted, and he sprinted along the corridor and
down the stairs, three at a time.
The entrance hall contained a few last-minute stragglers, all leaving the Great Hall
after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch the second task.
They stared as Harry flashed past, sending Colin and Dennis Creevey flying as he
leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright, chilly grounds.
As he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the dragons'
enclosure in November were now ranged along the opposite bank, rising in stands
that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake below. The excited
babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as Harry ran flat-out around
the other side of the lake toward the judges, who were sitting at another gold-
draped table at the water's edge. Cedric, Fleur, and Krum were beside the judges'
table, watching Harry sprint toward them.
"I'm . .. here ..." Harry panted, skidding to a halt in the mud and accidentally
splattering Fleurs robes.
"Where have you been?" said a bossy, disapproving voice. "The task's about to
start!"
Harry looked around. Percy Weasley was sitting at the judges' table - Mr. Crouch
had failed to turn up again.
"Now, now, Percy!" said Ludo Bagman, who was looking intensely relieved to see
Harry. "Let him catch his breath!"
Dumbledore smiled at Harry, but Karkaroff and Madame Maxime didn't look at all
pleased to see him. ... It was obvious from the looks on their faces that they had
thought he wasn't going to turn up.
Harry bent over, hands on his knees, gasping for breath; he had a stitch in his side
that felt as though he had a knife between his ribs, but there was no time to get rid
of it; Ludo Bagman was now moving among the champions, spacing them along
the bank at intervals of ten feet. Harry was on the very end of the line, next to
Krum, who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding his wand ready.
"All right. Harry?" Bagman whispered as he moved Harry a few feet farther away
from Krum. "Know what you're going to do?"
"Yeah," Harry panted, massaging his ribs.
Bagman gave Harry's shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges' table;
he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the World Cup, said,
"Sonorus!" and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands.
"Well, all our champions are ready for the second task, which will start on my
319whistle. They have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them.
On the count of three, then. One . . . two . . . three!"
The whistle echoed shrilly in the cold, still air; the stands erupted with cheers and
applause; without looking to see what the other champions were doing, Harry
pulled off his shoes and socks, pulled the handful of gillyweed out of his pocket,
stuffed it into his mouth, and waded out into the lake.
It was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as though this were fire, not icy
water. His sodden robes weighed him down as he walked in deeper; now the water
was over his knees, and his rapidly numbing feet were slipping over silt and flat,
slimy stones. He was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could; it felt
unpleasantly slimy and rubbery, like octopus tentacles. Waist-deep in the freezing
water he stopped, swallowed, and waited for something to happen.
He could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid, walking into
the lake without showing any sign of magical power. The part of him that was still
dry was covered in goose pimples; half immersed in the icy water, a cruel breeze
lifting his hair, Harry started to shiver violently. He avoided looking at the stands;
the laughter was becoming louder, and there were catcalls and jeering from the
Slytherins. ...
Then, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed
over his mouth and nose. He tried to draw breath, but it made his head spin; his
lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck -
Harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below his
ears, flapping in the cold air. . . . He had gills. Without pausing to think, he did the
only thing that made sense - he flung himself forward into the water.
The first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life. His head had stopped
spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his
gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He stretched out his hands in front of him
and stared at them. They looked green and ghostly under the water, and they had
become webbed. He twisted around and looked at his bare feet - they had become
elongated and the toes were webbed too:
It looked as though he had sprouted flippers.
The water didn't feel icy anymore either ... on the contrary, he felt pleasantly cool
and very light. . . . Harry struck out once more, marveling at how far and fast his
flipper-like feet propelled him through the vater, and noticing how clearly he
could see, and how he no longer seemed to need to blink. He had soon swum so
far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom. He flipped over and dived
into its depths.
Silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange, dark, foggy landscape.
He could only see ten feet around him, so that as he sped throuugh the water new
scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the incoming darkness: forests of rippling,
320tangled black weed, wide plains of mud littered with dull, glimmering stones. He
swam deeper and deeper, out toward the middle of the lake, his eyes wide, staring
through the eerily gray-lit water around him to the shadow beyond, where the
water became opaque.
Small fish flickered past him like silver darts. Once or twice he thought he saw
something larger moving ahead of him, but when he got nearer, he discovered it to
be nothing but a large, blackened log, or a dense clump of weed. There was no
sign of any of the other champions, merpeople, Ron - nor, thankfully, the giant
squid.
Light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see, two feet deep, like
a meadow of very overgrown grass. Harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him,
trying to discern shapes through the gloom . . . and then, without warning,
something grabbed hold of his ankle.
Harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water demon,
poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry's leg, its
pointed fangs bared - Harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and
fumbled for his wand. By the time he had grasped it, two more grindylows had
risen out of the weed, had seized handfuls of Harry's robes, and were attempting to
drag him down.
"Relashio!" Harry shouted, except that no sound came out. ... A large bubble
issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows,
pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where it struck
them, angry red patches appeared on their green skin. Harry pulled his ankle out of
the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as he could, occasionally sending more jets
of hot water over his shoulder at random; every now and then he felt one of the
grindylows snatch at his foot again, and he kicked out, hard; finally, he felt his
foot connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw the dazed grindylow
floating away, cross-eyed, while its fellows shook their fists at Harry and sank
back into the weed.
Harry slowed down a little, slipped his wand back inside his robes, and looked
around, listening again. He turned full circle in the water, the silence pressing
harder than ever against his eardrums. He knew he must be even deeper in the lake
now, but nothing was moving but the rippling weed.
"How are you getting on?"
Harry thought he was having a heart attack. He whipped around and saw Moaning
Myrtle floating hazily in front of him, gazing at him through her thick, pearly
glasses.
"Myrtle!" Harry tried to shout - but once again, nothing came out of his mouth but
a very large bubble. Moaning Myrtle actually giggled.
"You want to try over there!" she said, pointing. "I won't come with you. ... I don't
321like them much, they always chase me when I get too close. ..."
Harry gave her the thumbs-up to show his thanks and set off once more, careful to
swim a bit higher over the weed to avoid any more grindylows that might be
lurking there.
He swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes. He was passing over vast
expanses of black mud now, which swirled murkily as he disturbed the water.
Then, at long last, he heard a snatch of haunting mersong.
"An hour long you'll have to look,
And to recover what we took..."
Harry swam faster and soon saw a large rock emerge out of the muddy water
ahead. It had paintings of merpeople on it; they were carrying spears and chasing
what looked like the giant squid. Harry swam on past the rock, following the
mersong.
". . . your time's half gone, so tarry not
Lest what you seek stays here to rot. ..."
A cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae loomed suddenly out of the
gloom on all sides. Here and there at the dark windows, Harry saw faces . . . faces
that bore no resemblance at all to the painting of the mermaid in the prefects'
bathroom. . . .
The merpeople had grayish skin and long, wild, dark green hair. Their eyes were
yellow, as were their broken teeth, and they wore thick ropes of pebbles around
their necks. They leered at Harry as he swam past; one or two of them emerged
from their caves to watch him better, their powerful, silver fish tails beating the
water, spears clutched in their hands.
Harry sped on, staring around, and soon the dwellings became more numerous;
there were gardens of weed around some of them, and he even saw a pet
grindylow tied to a stake outside one door. Merpeople were emerging on all sides
now, watching him eagerly, pointing at his webbed hands and gills, talking behind
their hands to one another. Harry sped around a corner and a very strange sight
met his eyes.
A whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses that lined what
looked like a mer-version of a village square. A choir of merpeople was singing in
the middle, calling the champions toward them, and behind them rose a crude sort
of statue; a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder. Four people were bound
tightly to the tail of the stone merperson.
Ron was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang. There was also a girl who
looked no older than eight, whose clouds of silvery hair made Harry feel sure that
she was Fleur Delacour's sister. All four of them appeared to be in a very deep
322sleep. Their heads were lolling onto their shoulders, and fine streams of bubbles
kept issuing from their mouths.
Harry sped toward the hostages, half expecting the merpeople to lower their spears
and charge at him, but they did nothing. The ropes of weed tying the hostages to
the statue were thick, slimy, and very strong. For a fleeting second he thought of
the knife Sirius had bought him for Christmas - locked in his trunk in the castle a
quarter of a mile away, no use to him whatsoever.
He looked around. Many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying spears.
He swam swiftly toward a seven-foot-tall merman with a long green beard and a
choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the spear. The
merman laughed and shook his head.
"We do not help," he said in a harsh, croaky voice.
"Come ON!" Harry said fiercely (but only bubbles issued from his mouth), and he
tried to pull the spear away from the merman, but the merman yanked it back, still
shaking his head and laughing.
Harry swirled around, staring about. Something sharp . . . anything . . .
There were rocks littering the lake bottom. He dived and snatched up a particularly
jagged one and returned to the statue. He began to hack at the ropes binding Ron,
and after several minutes' hard work, they broke apart. Ron floated, unconscious, a
few inches above the lake bottom, drifting a little in the ebb of the water.
Harry looked around. There was no sign of any of the other champions. What were
they playing at? Why didn't they hurry up? He turned back to Hermione, raised the
jagged rock, and began to hack at her bindings too -
At once, several pairs of strong gray hands seized him. Half a dozen mermen were
pulling him away from Hermione, shaking their green-haired heads, and laughing.
"You take your own hostage," one of them said to him. "Leave the others ..."
"No way!" said Harry furiously - but only two large bubbles came out.
Your task is to retrieve your own friend . . . leave the others ..." She's my friend
too!" Harry yelled, gesturing toward Hermione, an enormous silver bubble
emerging soundlessly from his lips. "And I don't want them to die either!"
Cho's head was on Hermiones shoulder; the small silver-haired girl was ghostly
green and pale. Harry struggled to fight off the mermen, but they laughed harder
than ever, holding him back. Harry looked wildly around. Where were the other
champions? Would he have time to take Ron to the surface and come back down
for Hermione and the others? Would he be able to find them again? He looked
down at his watch to see how much time was left - it had stopped working.
But then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his head. Harry looked
323up and saw Cedric swimming toward them. There was an enormous bubble around
his head, which made his features look oddly wide and stretched.
"Got lost!" he mouthed, looking panic-stricken. "Fleur and Krum're coming now!"
Feeling enormously relieved, Harry watched Cedric pull a knife out of his pocket
and cut Cho free. He pulled her upward and out of sight.
Harry looked around, waiting. Where were Fleur and Krum? Time was getting
short, and according to the song, the hostages would be lost after an hour. . . .
The merpeople started screeching animatedly. Those holding Harry loosened their
grip, staring behind them. Harry turned and saw something monstrous cutting
through the water toward them: a human body in swimming trunks with the head
of a shark. ... It was Krum. He appeared to have transfigured himself- but badly.
The shark-man swam straight to Hermione and began snapping and biting at her
ropes; the trouble was that Krum's new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for
biting anything smaller than a dolphin, and Harry was quite sure that if Krum
wasn't careful, he was going to rip Hermione in half. Darting forward. Harry hit
Krum hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged stone. Krum seized it and began
to cut Hermione free. Within seconds, he had done it; he grabbed Hermione
around the waist, and without a backward glance, began to rise rapidly with her
toward the surface.
Now what? Harry thought desperately. If he could be sure that Fleur was coming. .
. . But still no sign. There was nothing to be done except. . .
He snatched up the stone, which Krum had dropped, but the mermen now closed
in around Ron and the little girl, shaking their heads at him. Harry pulled out his
wand.
"Get out of the way!"
Only bubbles flew out of his mouth, but he had the distinct impression that the
mermen had understood him, because they suddenly stopped laughing. Their
yellowish eyes were fixed upon Harry's wand, and they looked scared. There
might be a lot more of them than there were of him, but Harry could tell, by the
looks on their faces, that they knew no more magic than the giant squid did.
"You've got until three!" Harry shouted; a great stream of bubbles burst from him,
but he held up three fingers to make sure they got the message. "One . . ." (he put
down a finger) "two . . ." (he put down a second one) -
They scattered. Harry darted forward and began to hack at the ropes binding the
small girl to the statue, and at last she was free. He seized the little girl around the
waist, grabbed the neck of Rons robes, and kicked off from the bottom.
It was very slow work. He could no longer use his webbed hands to propel himself
forward; he worked his flippers furiously, but Ron and Fleur's sister were like
324potato-filled sacks dragging him back down. ... He fixed his eyes skyward, though
he knew he must still be very deep, the water above him was so dark, . . .
Merpeople were rising with him. He could see them swirling around him with
ease, watching him struggle through the water. .. . Would they pull him back down
to the depths when the time was up? Did they perhaps eat humans? Harry's legs
were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming; his shoulders were aching
horribly with the effort of dragging Ron and the girl...
He was drawing breath with extreme difficulty. He could feel pain on the sides of
his neck again ... he was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in his
mouth .. . yet the darkness was definitely thinning now... he could see daylight
above him.. ..
He kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that they were nothing more than
feet...water was flooding through his mouth into his lungs ... he was starting to feel
dizzy, but he knew light and air were only ten feet above him ... he had to get there
... he had to ...
Harry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as though his muscles were screaming
in protest; his very brain felt waterlogged, he couldn't breathe, he needed oxygen,
he had to keep going, he could not stop -
And then he felt his head break the surface of the lake; wonderful, cold, clear air
was making his wet face sting; he gulped it down, feeling as though he had never
breathed properly before, and, panting, pulled Ron and the little girl up with him.
All around him, wild, green-haired heads were emerging out of the water with
him, but they were smiling at him.
The crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise; shouting and screaming,
they all seemed to be on their feet; Harry had the impression they thought that Ron
and the little girl might be dead, but they were wrong . . . both of them had opened
their eyes; the girl looked scared and confused, but Ron merely expelled a great
spout of water, blinked in the bright light, turned to Harry, and said, "Wet, this,
isn't it?" Then he spotted Fleur's sister. "What did you bring her for?"
"Fleur didn't turn up, I couldn't leave her," Harry panted.
"Harry, you prat," said Ron, "you didn't take that song thing seriously, did you?
Dumbledore wouldn't have let any of us drown!"
"The song said -"
"It was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit!" said Ron. "I hope
you didn't waste time down there acting the hero!"
Harry felt both stupid and annoyed. It was all very well for Ron; he'd been asleep,
he hadn't felt how eerie it was down in the lake, surrounded by spear-carrying
merpeople who'd looked more than capable of murder.
325"C'mon," Harry said shortly, "help me with her, I don't think she can swim very
well."
They pulled Fleur's sister through the water, back toward the bank where the
judges stood watching, twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of
honor, singing their horrible screechy songs.
Harry could see Madam Pomfrey fussing over Hermione, Krum, Cedric, and Cho,
all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets.
Dumbledore and Ludo Bagman stood beaming at Harry and Ron from the bank as
they swam nearer, but Percy, who looked very white and somehow much younger
than usual, came splashing out to meet them. Meanwhile Madame Maxime was
trying to restrain Fleur Delacour, who was quite hysterical, fighting tooth and nail
to return to the water.
"Gabrielle! Gabrielle! Is she alive? Is she 'urt?"
"She's fine!" Harry tried to tell her, but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk,
let alone shout.
Percy seized Ron and was dragging him back to the bank ("Gerroff, Percy, I'm all
right!"); Dumbledore and Bagman were pulling Harry upright; Fleur had broken
free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister.
"It was ze grindylows . . . zey attacked me ... oh Gabrielle, I thought... I thought..
."
"Come here, you," said Madam Pomfrey. She seized Harry and pulled him over to
Hermione and the others, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though
he were in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat.
Steam gushed out of his ears.
"Harry, well done!" Hermione cried. "You did it, you found out how all by
yourself!"
"Well -" said Harry. He would have told her about Dobby, but he had just noticed
Karkaroff watching him. He was the only judge who had not left the table; the
only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that Harry, Ron, and Fleur's
sister had got back safely. "Yeah, that's right," said Harry, raising his voice
slightly so that Karkaroff could hear him.
"You haff a water beetle in your hair, Herm-own-ninny," said Krum. Harry had
the impression that Krum was drawing her attention back onto himself; perhaps to
remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake, but Hermione brushed away
the beetle impatiently and said, "You're well outside the time limit, though, Harry.
. . . Did it take you ages to find us?"
"No ... I found you okay...."
326Harry's feeling of stupidity was growing. Now he was out of the water, it seemed
perfectly clear that Dumbledores safety precautions wouldn't have permitted the
death of a hostage just because their champion hadn't turned up. Why hadn't he
just grabbed Ron and gone? He would have been first back.... Cedric and Krum
hadn't wasted time worrying about anyone else; they hadn't taken the mersong
seriously. ...
Dumbledore was crouching at the water's edge, deep in conversation with what
seemed to be the chief merperson, a particularly wild and ferocious-looking
female. He was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made
when they were above water; clearly, Dumbledore could speak Mermish. Finally
he straightened up, turned to his fellow judges, and said, "A conference before we
give the marks, I think."
The judges went into a huddle. Madam Pomfrey had gone to rescue Ron from
Percy's clutches; she led him over to Harry and the others, gave him a blanket and
some Pepperup Potion, then went to fetch Fleur and her sister. Fleur had many
cuts on her face and arms and her robes were torn, but she didn't seem to care, nor
would she allow Madam Pomfrey to clean them.
"Look after Gabrielle," she told her, and then she turned to Harry. "You saved 'er,"
she said breathlessly. "Even though she was not your 'ostage."
"Yeah," said Harry, who was now heartily wishing he'd left all three girls tied to
the statue.
Fleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek (he felt his face burn and
wouldn't have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again), then said
to Ron, "And you too-you 'elped -"
"Yeah," said Ron, looking extremely hopeful, "yeah, a bit -"
Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him. Hermione looked simply furious,
but just then, Ludo Bagman's magically magnified voice boomed out beside them,
making them all jump, and causing the crowd in the stands to go very quiet.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our decision. Merchieftainess Murcus
has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake, and we have therefore
decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions, as follows. . . .
"Fleur Delacour, though she demonstrated excellent use of the Bubble-Head
Charm, was attacked by grindylows as she approached her goal, and failed to
retrieve her hostage. We award her twenty-five points."
Applause from the stands.
"I deserved zero," said Fleur throatily, shaking her magnificent head.
"Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head Charm, was first to return with
his hostage, though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour."
327Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the crowd; Harry saw Cho give Cedric a
glowing look. "We therefore award him forty-seven points."
Harrys heart sank. If Cedric had been outside the time limit, he most certainly had
been.
"Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of Transfiguration, which was
nevertheless effective, and was second to return with his hostage. We award him
forty points."
Karkaroff clapped particularly hard, looking very superior.
"Harry Potter used gillyweed to great effect," Bagman continued. "He returned
last, and well outside the time limit of an hour. However, the Merchieftainess
informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the hostages, and that the delay in his
return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety, not merely his
own."
Ron and Hermione both gave Harry half-exasperated, half-commiserating looks.
"Most of the judges," and here, Bagman gave Karkaroff a very nasty look, "feel
that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks. However . . . Mr. Potter's score
is forty-five points."
Harry's stomach leapt - he was now tying for first place with Cedric. Ron and
Hermione, caught by surprise, stared at Harry, then laughed and started applauding
hard with the rest of the crowd.
"There you go. Harry!" Ron shouted over the noise. "You weren't being thick after
all - you were showing moral fiber!"
Fleur was clapping very hard too, but Krum didn't look happy at all. He attempted
to engage Hermione in conversation again, but she was too busy cheering Harry to
listen.
"The third and final task will take place at dusk on the twenty-fourth of June,"
continued Bagman. "The champions will be notified of what is coming precisely
one month beforehand. Thank you all for your support of the champions."
It was over. Harry thought dazedly, as Madam Pomfrey began herding the
champions and hostages back to the castle to get into dry clothes ... it was over, he
had got through ... he didn't have to worry about anything now until June the
twenty-fourth. . ..
Next time he was in Hogsmeade, Harry decided as he walked back up the stone
steps into the castle, he was going to buy Dobby a pair of socks for every day of
the year.
328CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN - PADFOOT RETURNS
One of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody
was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake, which meant
that Ron was getting to share Harry's limelight for once. Harry noticed that Ron's
version of events changed subtly with every retelling. At first, he gave what
seemed to be the truth; it tallied with Hermione's story, anyway - Dumbledore had
put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor McGonagall's office, first
assuring them that they would be quite safe, and would awake when they were
back above the water. One week later, however, Ron was telling a thrilling tale of
kidnap in which he struggled single-handedly against fifty heavily armed
merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him up.
"But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve," he assured Padma Patil, who seemed to
be a lot keener on Ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making
a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors. "I could've taken
those mer-idiots any time I wanted."
"What were you going to do, snore at them?" said Hermione waspishly. People
had been teasing her so much about being the thing that Viktor Krum would most
miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood.
Ron's ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of
events.
As they entered March the weather became drier, but cruel winds skinned their
hands and faces every time they went out onto the grounds. There were delays in
the post because the owls kept being blown off course. The brown owl that Harry
had sent to Sirius with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast
on Friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way; Harry had no
sooner torn off Sirius's reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it was going to be
sent outside again.
Sirius's letter was almost as short as the previous one.
Be at stile at end of road out of Hogsmeade (past Dervish and
Banges) at two o'clock on Saturday afternoon. Bring as much
food as you can.
"He hasn't come back to Hogsmeade?" said Ron incredulously.
"It looks like it, doesn't it?" said Hermione.
"I can't believe him," said Harry tensely, "if he's caught. . ."
329"Made it so far, though, hasn't he?" said Ron. "And it's not like the place is
swarming with dementors anymore."
Harry folded up the letter, thinking. If he was honest with himself, he really
wanted to see Sirius again. He therefore approached the final lesson of the
afternoon - double Potions - feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually
did when descending the steps to the dungeons.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door
with Pansy Parkinson's gang of Slytherin girls. All of them were looking at
something Harry couldn't see and sniggering heartily. Pansys pug-like face peered
excitedly around Goyle's broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached.
"There they are, there they are!" she giggled, and the knot of Slytherins broke
apart. Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her hands - Witch Weekly. The
moving picture on the front showed a curly-haired witch who was smiling toothily
and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand.
"You might find something to interest you in there, Granger!" Pansy said loudly,
and she threw the magazine at Hermione, who caught it, looking startled. At that
moment, the dungeon door opened, and Snape beckoned them all inside.
Hermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual.
Once Snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of todays
potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the
desk. At last, in the center pages, Hermione found what they were looking for.
Harry and Ron leaned in closer. A color photograph of Harry headed a short piece
entitled:
Harry Potter's Secret Heartache
A boy like no other, perhaps - yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of
adolescence, writes Rita Skeeter. Deprived of love since the tragic demise
of his parents, fourteen-year-old Harry Potter thought he had found solace in his
steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggle-born Hermione Granger. Little did he know
that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life already
littered with personal loss.
Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to have a taste for famous wizards
that Harry alone cannot satisfy. Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor Krum,
Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has
been toying with both boys' affections. Krum, who is openly smitten with the
devious Miss Granger, has already invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the
summer holidays, and insists that he has "never felt this way about any other girl."
However, it might not be Miss Granger's doubtful natural charms that have
captured these unfortunate boys' interest.
330"She's really ugly," says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty and vivacious fourth-year
student, "but she'd be well up to making a Love Potion, she's quite brainy. I think
that's how she's doing it."
Love Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and no doubt Albus Dumbledore
will want to investigate these claims. In the meantime, Harry Potters well-wishers
must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate.
"I told you!" Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared down at the article. "I told you
not to annoy Rita Skeeter! She's made you out to be some sort of- of scarlet
woman!"
Hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter. "Scarlet
woman?" she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at
Ron.
"It's what my mum calls them," Ron muttered, his ears going red.
"If that's the best Rita can do, she's losing her touch," said Hermione, still giggling,
as she threw Witch Weekly onto the empty chair beside her. "What a pile of old
rubbish."
She looked over at the Slytherins, who were all watching her and Harry closely
across the room to see if they had been upset by the article. Hermione gave them a
sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, Harry, and Ron started unpacking the
ingredients they would need for their Wit-Sharpening Potion.
"There's something funny, though," said Hermione ten minutes later, holding her
pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles. "How could Rita Skeeter have
known . . . ?"
"Known what?" said Ron quickly. "You haven't been mixing up Love Potions,
have you?"
"Don't be stupid," Hermione snapped, starting to pound up her beetles again. "No,
it's just. . . how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer?"
Hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided Ron's eyes.
"What?" said Ron, dropping his pestle with a loud clunk.
"He asked me right after he'd pulled me out of the lake,"
Hermione muttered. "After he'd got rid of his shark's head. Madam Pomfrey gave
us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they
wouldn't hear, and he said, if I wasn't doing anything over the summer, would I
like to -"
"And what did you say?" said Ron, who had picked up his pestle and was grinding
it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking at
331Hermione.
"And he did say he'd never felt the same way about anyone else," Hermione went
on, going so red now that Harry could almost feel the heat coming from her, "but
how could Rita Skeeter have heard him? She wasn't there ... or was she? Maybe
she has got an Invisibility Cloak; maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch
the second task. ..."
"And what did you say?" Ron repeated, pounding his pestle down so hard that it
dented the desk.
"Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay to-"
"Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is. Miss Granger," said an icy
voice right behind them, and all three of them jumped, "I must ask you not to
discuss it in my class. Ten points from Gryffindor."
Snape had glided over to their desk while they were talking. The whole class was
now looking around at them; Malfoy took the opportunity to flash POTTER
STINKS across the dungeon at Harry.
"Ah . . . reading magazines under the table as well?" Snape added, snatching up
the copy of Witch Weekly. "A further ten points from Gryffindor ... oh but of
course ..." Snapes black eyes glittered as they fell on Rita Skeeter's article. "Potter
has to keep up with his press cuttings. . . ."
The dungeon rang with the Slytherins' laughter, and an unpleasant smile curled
Snape's thin mouth. To Harry's fury, he began to read the article aloud.
"'Harry Potter's Secret Heartache. . . dear, dear. Potter, what's ailing you now? 'A
boy like no other, perhaps. . .'"
Harry could feel his face burning. Snape was pausing at the end of every sentence
to allow the Slytherins a hearty laugh. The article sounded ten times worse when
read by Snape. Even Hermione was blushing scarlet now.
"'. . . Harry Potter's well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart
upon a worthier candidate.' How very touching," sneered Snape, rolling up the
magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins. "Well, I think I had
better separate the three of you, so you can keep your minds on your potions rather
than on your tangled love lives. Weasley, you stay here. Miss Granger, over there,
beside Miss Parkinson. Potter - that table in front of my desk. Move. Now."
Furious, Harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and dragged it
up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table. Snape followed, sat down at his
desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron. Determined not to look at Snape,
Harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to have
Snape's face.
"All this press attention seems to have inflated your already over-large head.
332Potter," said Snape quietly, once the rest of the class had settled down again.
Harry didn't answer. He knew Snape was trying to provoke him; he had done this
before. No doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points from
Gryffindor before the end of the class.
"You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is
impressed with you," Snape went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him
(Harry continued to pound his scarab beetles, even though he had already reduced
them to a very fine powder), "but I don't care how many times your picture
appears in the papers. To me. Potter, you are nothing but a nasty little boy who
considers rules to be beneath him."
Harry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his
ginger roots. His hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his eyes
down, as though he couldn't hear what Snape was saying to him.
"So I give you fair warning, Potter," Snape continued in a sorter and more
dangerous voice, "pint-sized celebrity or not - if I catch you breaking into my
office one more time -"
"I haven't been anywhere near your office!" said Harry angrily, forgetting his
feigned deafness.
"Don't lie to me," Snape hissed, his fathomless black eyes boring into Harrys.
"Boomslang skin. Gillyweed. Both come from my private stores, and I know who
stole them."
Harry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink or to look guilty. In truth, he
hadn't stolen either of these things from Snape. Hermione had taken the
boomslang skin back in their second year - they had needed it for the Polyjuice
Potion - and while Snape had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been able
to prove it. Dobby, of course, had stolen the gillyweed.
"I don't know what you're talking about," Harry lied coldly.
"You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into!" Snape hissed. "I
know it. Potter! Now, Mad-Eye Moody might have joined your fan club, but I will
not tolerate your behavior! One more nighttime stroll into my office, Potter, and
you will pay!"
"Right," said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots. "I'll bear that in mind
if I ever get the urge to go in there."
Snape's eyes flashed. He plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes. For one
wild moment. Harry thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him -
then he saw that Snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear
potion. Harry stared at it.
"Do you know what this is. Potter?" Snape said, his eyes glittering dangerously
333again.
"No," said Harry, with complete honesty this time.
"It is Veritaserum - a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you
spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear," said Snape viciously.
"Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines. But
unless you watch your step, you might just find that my hand slips" - he shook the
crystal bottle slightly - "right over your evening pumpkin juice. And then. Potter . .
. then we'll find out whether you've been in my office or not."
Harry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked up his
knife, and started slicing them again. He didn't like the sound of that Truth Potion
at all, nor would he put it past Snape to slip him some. He repressed a shudder at
the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape did it... quite
apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble - Hermione and Dobby for a
start - there were all the other things he was concealing . . . like the fact that he
was in contact with Sirius . . . and - his insides squirmed at the thought - how he
felt about Cho. ... He tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too, and wondered
whether he ought to take a leaf out of Moody s book and start drinking only from a
private hip flask.
There was a knock on the dungeon door.
"Enter," said Snape in his usual voice.
The class looked around as the door opened. Professor Karkaroff came in.
Everyone watched him as he walked up toward Snape's desk. He was twisting his
finger around his goatee and looking agitated.
"We need to talk," said Karkaroff abruptly when he had reached Snape. He
seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was
barely opening his lips; it was as though he were a rather poor ventriloquist. Harry
kept his eyes on his ginger roots, listening hard.
"I'll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff," Snape muttered, but Karkaroff
interrupted him.
"I want to talk now, while you can't slip off, Severus. You've been avoiding me."
"After the lesson," Snape snapped.
Under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if he'd poured out enough
armadillo bile, Harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them. Karkaroff
looked extremely worried, and Snape looked angry.
Karkaroff hovered behind Snape's desk for the rest of the double period. He
seemed intent on preventing Snape from slipping away at the end of class. Keen to
hear what Karkaroff wanted to say, Harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of
armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell, which gave him an excuse to
334duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class moved
noisily toward the door.
"What's so urgent?" he heard Snape hiss at Karkaroff.
"This," said Karkaroff, and Harry, peering around the edge of his cauldron, saw
Karkaroff pull up the left-hand sleeve of his robe and show Snape something on
his inner forearm.
"Well?" said Karkaroff, still making every effort not to move his lips. "Do you
see? It's never been this clear, never since - "
"Put it away!" snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping the classroom.
"But you must have noticed -" Karkaroff began in an agitated voice.
"We can talk later, Karkaroff!" spat Snape. "Potter! What are you doing?"
"Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor," said Harry innocently, straightening
up and showing Snape the sodden rag he was holding.
Karkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon. He looked both
worried and angry. Not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry
Snape, Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top
speed to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just witnessed.
They left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun shining down
upon the grounds. The weather was milder than it had been all year, and by the
time they arrived in Hogsmeade, all three of them had taken off their cloaks and
thrown them over their shoulders. The food Sirius had told them to bring was in
Harry's bag; they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs, a loaf of bread, and a flask of
pumpkin juice from the lunch table.
They went into Gladrags Wizardwear to buy a present for Dobby, where they had
fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find, including a pair patterned with
flashing gold and silver stars, and another that screamed loudly when they became
too smelly. Then, at half past one, they made their way up the High Street, past
Dervish and Banges, and out toward the edge of the village.
Harry had never been in this direction before. The winding lane was leading them
out into the wild countryside around Hogsmeade. The cottages were fewer here,
and their gardens larger; they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in
whose shadow Hogsmeade lay. Then they turned a corner and saw a stile at the
end of the lane. Waiting for them, its front paws on the topmost bar, was a very
large, shaggy black dog, which was carrying some newspapers in its mouth and
looking very familiar. . . .
"Hello, Sirius," said Harry when they had reached him.
The black dog sniffed Harry's bag eagerly, wagged its tail once, then turned and
335began to trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to meet
the rocky foot of the mountain. Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed over the stile
and followed.
Sirius led them to the very foot of the mountain, where the ground was covered
with boulders and rocks. It was easy for him, with his four paws, but Harry, Ron,
and Hermione were soon out of breath. They followed Sirius higher, up onto the
mountain itself. For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep, winding, and stony
path, following Sirius's wagging tail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder straps of
Harry's bag cutting into his shoulders.
Then, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached the place where he
had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the rock. They squeezed into it and
found themselves in a cool, dimly lit cave. Tethered at the end of it, one end of his
rope around a large rock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half gray horse, half giant
eagle, Buckbeak's fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them. All three of them
bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a moment, Buckbeak
bent his scaly front knees and allowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his
feathery neck. Harry, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just
turned into his godfather.
Sirius was wearing ragged gray robes; the same ones he had been wearing when
he had left Azkaban. His black hair was longer than it had been when he had
appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted once more. He looked very thin.
"Chicken!" he said hoarsely after removing the old Daily Prophets from his mouth
and throwing them down onto the cave floor.
Harry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread.
"Thanks," said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sitting down on the cave
floor, and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth. "I've been living off rats mostly.
Can't steal too much food from Hogsmeade; I'd draw attention to myself."
He grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin only reluctantly.
"What're you doing here, Sirius?" he said.
"Fulfilling my duty as godfather," said Sirius, gnawing on the chicken bone in a
very doglike way. "Don't worry about it, I'm pretending to be a lovable stray."
He was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in Harrys face, said more seriously, "I
want to be on the spot. Your last letter . . . well, let's just say things are getting
fishier. I've been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out, and by the
looks of things, I'm not the only one who's getting worried."
He nodded at the yellowing Daily Prophets on the cave floor, and Ron picked
them up and unfolded them. Harry, however, continued to stare at Sirius.
"What if they catch you? What if you're seen?"
336"You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I'm an
Animagus," said Sirius, shrugging, and continuing to devour the chicken leg.
Ron nudged Harry and passed him the Daily Prophets. There were two: The first
bore the headline Mystery Illness ofBartemius Crouch, the second, Ministry Witch
Still Missing-Minister of Magic Now Personally Involved.
Harry scanned the story about Crouch. Phrases jumped out at him: hasn't been
seen in public since November. . . house appears deserted. . . St. Mungo's Hospital
for Magical Maladies and Injuries decline comment. . . Ministry refuses to confirm
rumors of critical illness. . . .
"They're making it sound like he's dying," said Harry slowly. "But he can't be that
ill if he managed to get up here. . . ."
"My brothers Crouch's personal assistant," Ron informed Sirius. "He says Crouch
is suffering from overwork."
"Mind you, he did look ill, last time I saw him up close," said Harry slowly, still
reading the story. "The night my name came out of the goblet. ..."
"Getting his comeuppance for sacking Winky, isn't he?" said Hermione, an edge to
her voice. She was stroking Buckbeak, who was crunching up Sirius's chicken
bones. "I bet he wishes he hadn't done it now - bet he feels the difference now
she's not there to look after him."
"Hermione's obsessed with house-elfs," Ron muttered to Sirius, casting Hermione
a dark look. Sirius, however, looked interested.
"Crouch sacked his house-elf?"
"Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup," said Harry, and he launched into the story of
the Dark Mark's appearance, and Winky being found with Harrys wand clutched
in her hand, and Mr. Crouch's fury. When Harry had finished, Sirius was on his
feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave.
"Let me get this straight," he said after a while, brandishing a fresh chicken leg.
"You first saw the elfin the Top Box. She was saving Crouch a seat, right?"
"Right," said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.
"But Crouch didn't turn up for the match?"
"No," said Harry. "I think he said he'd been too busy."
Sirius paced all around the cave in silence. Then he said, "Harry, did you check
your pockets for your wand after you'd left the Top Box?"
"Erm . . ." Harry thought hard. "No," he said finally. "I didn't need to use it before
we got in the forest. And then I put my hand in my pocket, and all that was in
there were my Omnioculars." He stared at Sirius. "Are you saying whoever
337conjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box?"
"It's possible," said Sirius.
"Winky didn't steal that wand!" Hermione insisted.
"The elf wasn't the only one in that box," said Sirius, his brow furrowed as he
continued to pace. "Who else was sitting behind you?"
"Loads of people," said Harry. "Some Bulgarian ministers .. . Cornelius Fudge ...
the Malfoys ..."
"The Malfoys!" said Ron suddenly, so loudly that his voice echoed all around the
cave, and Buckbeak tossed his head nervously. "I bet it was Lucius Malfoy!"
"Anyone else?" said Sirius.
"No one," said Harry.
"Yes, there was, there was Ludo Bagman," Hermione reminded him.
"Oh yeah . . ."
"I don't know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the
Wimbourne Wasps," said Sirius, still pacing. "What's he like?"
"He's okay," said Harry. "He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard
Tournament."
"Does he, now?" said Sirius, frowning more deeply. "I wonder why he'd do that?"
"Says he's taken a liking to me," said Harry.
"Hmm," said Sirius, looking thoughtful.
"We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared," Hermione told
Sirius. "Remember?" she said to Harry and Ron.
"Yeah, but he didn't stay in the forest, did he?" said Ron. "The moment we told
him about the riot, he went off to the campsite."
"How d'you know?" Hermione shot back. "How d'you know where he
Disapparated to?"
"Come off it," said Ron incredulously. "Are you saying you reckon Ludo Bagman
conjured the Dark Mark?"
"It's more likely he did it than Winky," said Hermione stubbornly.
"Told you," said Ron, looking meaningfully at Sirius, "told you she's obsessed
with house -"
But Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron.
338"When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered holding
Harry's wand, what did Crouch do?"
"Went to look in the bushes," said Harry, "but there wasn't anyone else there."
"Of course," Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, "of course, he'd want to pin it
on anyone but his own elf... and then he sacked her?"
"Yes," said Hermione in a heated voice, "he sacked her, just because she hadn't
stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled -"
"Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!" said Ron.
Sirius shook his head and said, "She's got the measure of Crouch better than you
have, Ron. If you want to know what a mans like, take a good look at how he
treats his inferiors, not his equals."
He ran a hand over his unshaven face, evidently thinking hard.
"All these absences of Barty Crouch's ... he goes to the trouble of making sure his
house-elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn't bother to turn
up and watch. He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament, and then
stops coming to that too. . . . It's not like Crouch. If he's ever taken a day off work
because of illness before this, I'll eat Buckbeak."
"D'you know Crouch, then?" said Harry.
Sirius's face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when
Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer.
"Oh I know Crouch all right," he said quietly. "He was the one who gave the order
for me to be sent to Azkaban - without a trial."
"What?" said Ron and Hermione together.
"You're kidding!" said Harry.
"No, I'm not," said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken. "Crouch used to be
Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn't you know?"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione shook their heads.
"He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic," said Sirius. "He's a great wizard,
Barty Crouch, powerfully magical - and power-hungry. Oh never a Voldemort
supporter," he said, reading the look on Harrys face. "No, Barty Crouch was
always very outspoken against the Dark Side. But then a lot of people who were
against the Dark Side . . . well, you wouldn't understand . . . you're too young. ..."
"That's what my dad said at the World Cup," said Ron, with a trace of irritation in
his voice. "Try us, why don't you?"
339A grin flashed across Sirius's thin face.
"All right, I'll try you. . . ." He walked once up the cave, back again, and then said,
"Imagine that Voldemort's powerful now. You don't know who his supporters are,
you don't know who's working for him and who isn't; you know he can control
people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves. You're
scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends. Every week, news comes of
more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing . . . the Ministry of Magic's in
disarray, they don't know what to do, they're trying to keep everything hidden
from the Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too. Terror everywhere . . .
panic . . . confusion . . . that's how it used to be.
"Well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others.
Crouch's principles might've been good in the beginning - I wouldn't know. He
rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures
against Voldemorts supporters. The Aurors were given new powers - powers to
kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn't the only one who was handed
straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and
authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he
became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side. He had his supporters,
mind you - plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and
there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister
of Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until
Crouch got the top job. But then something rather unfortunate happened. ..." Sirius
smiled grimly. "Crouch's own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who'd
managed to talk their way out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to find
Voldemort and return him to power."
"Crouch's son was caught?" gasped Hermione.
"Yep," said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, flinging himself back
down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half. "Nasty little
shock for old Barty, I'd imagine. Should have spent a bit more time at home with
his family, shouldn't he? Ought to have left the office early once in a while . . .
gotten to know his own son."
He began to wolf down large pieces of bread.
"Was his son a Death Eater?" said Harry.
"No idea," said Sirius, still stuffing down bread. "I was in Azkaban myself when
he was brought in. This is mostly stuff I've found out since I got out. The boy was
definitely caught in the company of people I'd bet my life were Death Eaters - but
he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the house-elf."
"Did Crouch try and get his son off?" Hermione whispered.
Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark.
340"Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the measure of him, Hermione!
Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated his
whole life to becoming Minister of Magic. You saw him dismiss a devoted house-
elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again - doesn't that tell you
what he's like? Crouch's fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son
a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn't much more than an excuse for Crouch to show
how much he hated the boy . . . then he sent him straight to Azkaban."
"He gave his own son to the dementors?" asked Harry quietly.
"That's right," said Sirius, and he didn't look remotely amused now. "I saw the
dementors bringing him in, watched them through the bars in my cell door. He
can't have been more than nineteen. They took him into a cell near mine. He was
screaming for his mother by nightfall. He went quiet after a few days, though . .
.they all went quiet in the end. . . except when they shrieked in their sleep. ..."
For a moment, the deadened look in Sirius's eyes became more pronounced than
ever, as though shutters had closed behind them.
"So he's still in Azkaban?" Harry said.
"No," said Sirius dully. "No, he's not in there anymore. He died about a year after
they brought him in."
"He died?"
"He wasn't the only one," said Sirius bitterly. "Most go mad in there, and plenty
stop eating in the end. They lose the will to live. You could always tell when a
death was coming, because the dementors could sense it, they got excited. That
boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived. Crouch being an important Ministry
member, he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit. That was the last time I
saw Barty Crouch, half carrying his wife past my cell. She died herself,
apparently, shortly afterward. Grief. Wasted away just like the boy. Crouch never
came for his sons body. The dementors buried him outside the fortress; I watched
them do it."
Sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked up
the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it.
"So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made," he continued,
wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. "One moment, a hero, poised to
become Minister of Magic...next, his son dead, his wife dead, the family name
dishonored, and, so I've heard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity. Once the
boy had died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and
started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray.
The conclusion was that his father never cared much for him. So Cornelius Fudge
got the top job, and Crouch was shunted sideways into the Department of
International Magical Cooperation."
341There was a long silence. Harry was thinking of the way Crouch's eyes had bulged
as he'd looked down at his disobedient house-elf back in the wood at the Quidditch
World Cup. This, then, must have been why Crouch had overreacted to Winky
being found beneath the Dark Mark. It had brought back memories of his son, and
the old scandal, and his fall from grace at the Ministry.
"Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards," Harry told Sirius.
"Yeah, I've heard it's become a bit of a mania with him," said Sirius, nodding. "If
you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one
more Death Eater."
"And he sneaked up here to search Snape's office!" s aid Ron triumphantly,
looking at Hermione.
"Yes, and that doesn't make sense at all," said Sirius.
"Yeah, it does!" said Ron excitedly, but Sirius shook his head.
"Listen, if Crouch wants to investigate Snape, why hasn't he been coming to judge
the tournament? It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to Hogwarts
and keep an eye on him."
"So you think Snape could be up to something, then?" asked Harry, but Hermione
broke in.
"Look, I don't care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape -"
"Oh give it a rest, Hermione," said Ron impatiently. "I know Dumbledores
brilliant and everything, but that doesn't mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn't
fool him -"
"Why did Snape save Harry's life in the first year, then? Why didn't he just let him
die?"
"I dunno - maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out-"
"What d'you think, Sirius?" Harry said loudly, and Ron and Hermione stopped
bickering to listen.
"I think they've both got a point," said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at Ron and
Hermione. "Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here, I've wondered why
Dumbledore hired him. Snape's always been fascinated by the Dark Arts, he was
famous for it at school. Slimy, oily, greasy-haired kid, he was," Sirius added, and
Harry and Ron grinned at each other. "Snape knew more curses when he arrived at
school than half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of a gang of Slytherins
who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters."
Sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names.
"Rosier and Wilkes - they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort
342fell. The Lestranges - they're a married couple - they're in Azkaban. Avery - from
what I've heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he'd been acting under
the Imperius Curse - he's still at large. But as far as I know, Snape was never even
accused of being a Death Eater - not that that means much. Plenty of them were
never caught. And Snape s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself
out of trouble."
"Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet," said Ron.
"Yeah, you should've seen Snape's face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions
yesterday!" said Harry quickly. "Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says
Snape's been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really worried. He showed Snape
something on his arm, but I couldn't see what it was."
He showed Snape something on his arm?" said Sirius, looking frankly bewildered.
He ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair, then shrugged again. "Well,
I've no idea what that's about. . . but if Karkaroff s genuinely worried, and he's
going to Snape for answers ..."
Sirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of frustration.
"There's still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and I know Dumbledore trusts
where a lot of other people wouldn't, but I just can't see him letting Snape teach at
Hogwarts if he'd ever worked for Voldemort."
"Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snapes office then?" said Ron
stubbornly.
"Well," said Sirius slowly, "I wouldn't put it past Mad-Eye to have searched every
single teacher's office when he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defense Against the
Dark Arts seriously, Moody. I'm not sure he trusts anyone at all, and after the
things he's seen, it's not surprising. I'll say this for Moody, though, he never killed
if he could help it. Always brought people in alive where possible. He was tough,
but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters. Crouch, though . . . he's a
different matter ... is he really ill? If he is, why did he make the effort to drag
himself up to Snape's office? And if he's not. . . what's he up to? What was he
doing at the World Cup that was so important he didn't turn up in the Top Box?
What's he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament?"
Sirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall. Buckbeak was ferreting
around on the rocky floor, looking for bones he might have overlooked. Finally,
Sirius looked up at Ron.
"You say your brother s Crouch's personal assistant? Any chance you could ask
him if he's seen Crouch lately?"
"I can try," said Ron doubtfully. "Better not make it sound like I reckon Crouch is
up to anything dodgy, though. Percy loves Crouch."
343"And you might try and find out whether they've got any leads on Bertha Jorkins
while you're at it," said Sirius, gesturing to the second copy of the Daily Prophet.
"Bagman told me they hadn't," said Harry.
"Yes, he's quoted in the article in there," said Sirius, nodding at the paper.
"Blustering on about how bad Bertha's memory is. Well, maybe she's changed
since I knew her, but the Bertha I knew wasn't forgetful at all - quite the reverse.
She was a bit dim, but she had an excellent memory for gossip. It used to get her
into a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut. I can see her
being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic . . . maybe that's why Bagman
didn't bother to look for her for so long. ..."
Sirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes.
"What's the time?"
Harry checked his watch, then remembered it hadn't been working since it had
spent over an hour in the lake.
"It's half past three," said Hermione.
"You'd better get back to school," Sirius said, getting to his feet. "Now listen . . ."
He looked particularly hard at Harry. "I don't want you lot sneaking out of school
to see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still want to hear about anything
odd. But you're not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission; it would be an
ideal opportunity for someone to attack you."
"No one's tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a couple of grindylows,"
Harry said, but Sirius scowled at him.
"I don't care . . . I'll breathe freely again when this tournament's over, and that's not
until June. And don't forget, if you're talking about me among yourselves, call me
Snuffles, okay?"
He handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat Buckbeak good-bye.
"I'll walk to the edge of the village with you," said Sirius, "see if I can scrounge
another paper."
He transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave, and they walked
back down the mountainside with him, across the boulder-strewn ground, and
back to the stile. Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head, before
turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione made their way back into Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts.
"Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch?" Ron said as they walked up
the drive to the castle. "But maybe he doesn't care . . . It'd probably just make him
admire Crouch even more. Yeah, Percy loves rules. He'd just say Crouch was
refusing to break them for his own son."
344"Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors," said Hermione
severely.
"I don't know," said Ron. "If he thought we were standing in the way of his career
.. . Percy's really ambitious, you know. ..."
They walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall, where the delicious smells
of dinner wafted toward them from the Great Hall.
"Poor old Snuffles," said Ron, breathing deeply. "He must really like you. Harry. .
. . Imagine having to live off rats."
345CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT - THE MADNESS OF MR CROUCH
Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery after breakfast on Sunday to
send a letter to Percy, asking, as Sirius had suggested, whether he had seen Mr.
Crouch lately. They used Hedwig, because it had been so long since she'd had a
job. When they had watched her fly out of sight through the Owlery window, they
proceeded down to the kitchen to give Dobby his new socks.
The house-elves gave them a very cheery welcome, bowing and curtsying and
bustling around making tea again. Dobby was ecstatic about his present.
"Harry Potter is too good to Dobby!" he squeaked, wiping large tears out of his
enormous eyes.
"You saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you really did," said Harry.
"No chance of more of those eclairs, is there?" said Ron, who was looking around
at the beaming and bowing house-elves.
"You've just had breakfast!" said Hermione irritably, but a great silver platter of
eclairs was already zooming toward them, supported by four elves.
"We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles," Harry muttered.
"Good idea," said Ron. "Give Pig something to do. You couldn't give us a bit of
extra food, could you?" he said to the surrounding elves, and they bowed
delightedly and hurried off to get some more.
"Dobby, where's Winky?" said Hermione, who was looking around.
"Winky is over there by the fire, miss," said Dobby quietly, his ears drooping
slightly.
"Oh dear," said Hermione as she spotted Winky.
Harry looked over at the fireplace too. Winky was sitting on the same stool as last
time, but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not immediately
distinguishable from the smoke-blackened brick behind her. Her clothes were
ragged and unwashed. She was clutching a bottle of butterbeer and swaying
slightly on her stool, staring into the fire. As they watched her, she gave an
enormous hiccup.
"Winky is getting through six bottles a day now," Dobby whispered to Harry.
"Well, it's not strong, that stuff," Harry said.
But Dobby shook his head. "'Tis strong for a house-elf, sir," he said.
346Winky hiccuped again. The elves who had brought the eclairs gave her
disapproving looks as they returned to work.
"Winky is pining, Harry Potter," Dobby whispered sadly. "Winky wants to go
home. Winky still thinks Mr. Crouch is her master, sir, and nothing Dobby says
will persuade her that Professor Dumbledore is her master now."
"Hey, Winky," said Harry, struck by a sudden inspiration, walking over to her, and
bending down, "you don't know what Mr. Crouch might be up to, do you? Because
he's stopped turning up to judge the Triwizard Tournament."
Winky's eyes flickered. Her enormous pupils focused on Harry. She swayed
slightly again and then said, "M - Master is stopped - hic - coming?"
"Yeah," said Harry, "we haven't seen him since the first task. The Daily Prophet's
saying he's ill."
Winky swayed some more, staring blurrily at Harry.
"Master- hic- ill?"
Her bottom lip began to tremble.
"But we're not sure if that's true," said Hermione quickly.
"Master is needing his - hie - Winky!" whimpered the elf. "Master cannot - hic -
manage - hic - all by himself. . . ."
"Other people manage to do their own housework, you know, Winky," Hermione
said severely.
"Winky - hic - is not only - hic - doing housework for Mr. Crouch!" Winky
squeaked indignantly, swaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer down her
already heavily stained blouse. "Master is - hic - trusting Winky with - hic - the
most important - hic - the most secret..."
"What?" said Harry.
But Winky shook her head very hard, spilling more butterbeer down herself.
"Winky keeps - hic - her master's secrets," she said mutinously, swaying very
heavily now, frowning up at Harry with her eyes crossed. "You is - hic - nosing,
you is."
"Winky must not talk like that to Harry Potter!" said Dobby angrily. "Harry Potter
is brave and noble and Harry Potter is not nosy!"
"He is nosing - hic - into my master's - hic - private and secret - hic - Winky is a
good house-elf- hic - Winky keeps her silence - hic - people trying to - hic - pry
and poke - hic -"
347Winky's eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off her stool into
the hearth, snoring loudly. The empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away across the
stone-flagged floor. Half a dozen house-elves came hurrying forward, looking
disgusted. One of them picked up the bottle; the others covered Winky with a
large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly, hiding her from view.
"We is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss!" squeaked a nearby elf, shaking his
head and looking very ashamed. "We is hoping you will not judge us all by
Winky, sirs and miss!"
"She's unhappy!" said Hermione, exasperated. "Why don't you try and cheer her
up instead of covering her up?"
"Begging your pardon, miss," said the house-elf, bowing deeply again, "but house-
elves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be
served."
"Oh for heavens sake!" Hermione cried. "Listen to me, all of you! You've got just
as much right as wizards to be unhappy! You've got the right to wages and
holidays and proper clothes, you don't have to do everything you're told - look at
Dobby!"
"Miss will please keep Dobby out of this," Dobby mumbled, looking scared. The
cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the house-elves around the kitchen.
They were suddenly looking at Hermione as though she were mad and dangerous.
"We has your extra food!" squeaked an elf at Harry's elbow, and he shoved a large
ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into Harry's arms. "Good-bye!"
The house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and Hermione and began shunting
them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backs.
"Thank you for the socks, Harry Potter!" Dobby called miserably from the hearth,
where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was Winky.
"You couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you, Hermione?" said Ron angrily as
the kitchen door slammed shut behind them. "They won't want us visiting them
now! We could've tried to get more stuff out of Winky about Crouch!"
"Oh as if you care about that!" scoffed Hermione. "You only like coming down
here for the food!"
It was an irritable sort of day after that. Harry got so tired of Ron and Hermione
sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that he took
Sirius's food up to the Owlery that evening on his own.
Pigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the mountain by
himself, so Harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls as well. When they
had set off into the dusk, looking extremely odd carrying the large package
between them. Harry leaned on the windowsill, looking out at the grounds, at the
348dark, rustling treetops of the Forbidden Forest, and the rippling sails of the
Durmstrang ship. An eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from Hagrids
chimney; it soared toward the castle, around the Owlery, and out of sight. Looking
down, Harry saw Hagrid digging energetically in front of his cabin. Harry
wondered what he was doing; it looked as though he were making a new vegetable
patch. As he watched, Madame Maxime emerged from the Beauxbatons carriage
and walked over to Hagrid. She appeared to be trying to engage him in
conversation. Hagrid leaned upon his spade, but did not seem keen to prolong their
talk, because Madame Maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterward.
Unwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to Ron and Hermione
snarling at each other, Harry watched Hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed
him and the owls around Harry began to awake, swooshing past him into the night.
By breakfast the next day Ron's and Hermione's bad moods had burnt out, and to
Harrys relief, Ron's dark predictions that the house-elves would send substandard
food up to the Gryffindor table because Hermione had insulted them proved false;
the bacon, eggs, and kippers were quite as good as usual.
When the post owls arrived, Hermione looked up eagerly; she seemed to be
expecting something.
"Percy won't've had time to answer yet," said Ron. "We only sent Hedwig
yesterday."
"No, it's not that," said Hermione. "I've taken out a subscription to the Daily
Prophet. I'm getting sick of finding everything out from the Slytherins."
"Good thinking!" said Harry, also looking up at the owls. "Hey, Hermione, I think
you're in luck -"
A gray owl was soaring down toward Hermione.
"It hasn't got a newspaper, though," she said, looking disappointed. "It's -"
But to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front of her plate, closely
followed by four barn owls, a brown owl, and a tawny.
"How many subscriptions did you take out?" said Harry, seizing Hermione's
goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls, all of whom were jostling
close to her, trying to deliver their own letter first.
"What on earth - ?" Hermione said, taking the letter from the gray owl, opening it,
and starting to read. "Oh really!" she sputtered, going rather red.
"What's up?" said Ron.
"It,'s - oh how ridiculous -"
She thrust the letter at Harry, who saw that it was not handwritten, but composed
349from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the Daily Prophet.
YOU ARE A WICKED GIRL. HARRY POTTER DESERVES
BETTER. GO BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM MUGGLE.
"They're all like it!" said Hermione desperately, opening one letter after another.
"'Harry Potter can do much better than the likes of you. . . .' 'You deserve to be
boiled in frog spawn. . . .' Ouch!"
She had opened the last envelope, and yellowish-green liquid smelling strongly of
petrol gushed over her hands, which began to erupt in large yellow boils.
"Undiluted bubotuber pus!" said Ron, picking up the envelope gingerly and
sniffing it.
"Ow!" said Hermione, tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub the pus off her
hands with a napkin, but her fingers were now so thickly covered in painful sores
that it looked as though she were wearing a pair of thick, knobbly gloves.
"You'd better get up to the hospital wing," said Harry as the owls around
Hermione took flight. "We'll tell Professor Sprout where you've gone. . . ."
"I warned her!" said Ron as Hermione hurried out of the Great Hall, cradling her
hands. "I warned her not to annoy Rita Skeeter! Look at this one ..." He read out
one of the letters Hermione had left behind: "I read In Witch Weekly about how
you are playing Harry Potter false and that boy has had enough hardship and I will
be sending you a curse by next post as soon as I can find a big enough envelope.'
Blimey, she'd better watch out for herself."
Hermione didn't turn up for Herbology. As Harry and Ron left the greenhouse for
their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle
descending the stone steps of the castle. Pansy Parkinson was whispering and
giggling behind them with her gang of Slytherin girls. Catching sight of Harry,
Pansy called, "Potter, have you split up with your girlfriend? Why was she so
upset at breakfast?"
Harry ignored her; he didn't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how
much trouble the Witch Weekly article had caused.
Hagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns, was
waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet.
Harrys heart sank at the sight of the crates - surely not another skrewt hatching? -
but when he got near enough to see inside, he found himself looking at a number
of flurry black creatures with long snouts. Their front paws were curiously flat,
like spades, and they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled at all
the attention.
"These're nifflers," said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around. "Yeh find
'em down mines mostly. They like sparkly stuff. . . . There yeh go, look."
350One of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite Pansy Parkinson's
watch off her wrist. She shrieked and jumped backward.
"Useful little treasure detectors," said Hagrid happily. "Thought we'd have some
fun with 'em today. See over there?" He pointed at the large patch of freshly
turned earth Harry had watched him digging from the Owlery window. "I've
buried some gold coins. I've got a prize fer whoever picks the niffler that digs up
most. Jus' take off all yer valuables, an' choose a niffler, an get ready ter set 'em
loose."
Harry took off his watch, which he was only wearing out of habit, as it didn't work
anymore, and stuffed it into his pocket. Then he picked up a niffler. It put its long
snout in Harry's ear and sniffed enthusiastically. It was really quite cuddly.
"Hang on," said Hagrid, looking down into the crate, "there's a spare niffler here . .
. who's missin? Where's Hermione?"
"She had to go to the hospital wing," said Ron.
"We'll explain later," Harry muttered; Pansy Parkinson was listening.
It was easily the most fun they had ever had in Care of Magical Creatures. The
nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though it were water, each
scurrying back to the student who had released it and spitting gold into their
hands. Ron's was particularly efficient; it had soon filled his lap with coins.
"Can you buy these as pets, Hagrid?" he asked excitedly as his niffler dived back
into the soil, splattering his robes.
"Yer mum wouldn' be happy, Ron," said Hagrid, grinning. "They wreck houses,
nifflers. I reckon they've nearly got the lot, now," he added, pacing around the
patch of earth while the nifflers continued to dive. "I on'y buried a hundred coins.
Oh there y'are, Hermione!"
Hermione was walking toward them across the lawn. Her hands were very heavily
bandaged and she looked miserable. Pansy Parkinson was watching her beadily.
"Well, let's check how yeh've done!" said Hagrid. "Count yer coins! An' there's no
point tryin' ter steal any, Goyle," he added, his beetle-black eyes narrowed. "It's
leprechaun gold. Vanishes after a few hours."
Goyle emptied his pockets, looking extremely sulky. It turned out that Ron's
niffler had been most successful, so Hagrid gave him an enormous slab of
Honeydukes chocolate for a prize. The bell rang across the grounds for lunch; the
rest of the class set off back to the castle, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione stayed
behind to help Hagrid put the nifflers back in their boxes. Harry noticed Madame
Maxime watching them out other carriage window.
"What yeh done ter your hands, Hermione?" said Hagrid, looking concerned.
351Hermione told him about the hate mail she had received that morning, and the
envelope full of bubotuber pus.
"Aaah, don worry," said Hagrid gendy, looking down at her. "I got some o' those
letters an all, after Rita Skeeter wrote abou me mum. 'Yeh're a monster an yeh
should be put down.' 'Yer mother killed innocent people an if you had any decency
you d jump in a lake.'"
"No!" said Hermione, looking shocked.
"Yeah," said Hagrid, heaving the niffler crates over by his cabin wall. "They're jus'
nutters, Hermione. Don' open 'em if yeh get any more. Chuck 'em straigh' in the
fire."
"You missed a really good lesson," Harry told Hermione as they headed back
toward the castle. "They're good, nifflers, aren't they, Ron?"
Ron, however, was frowning at the chocolate Hagrid had given him. He looked
thoroughly put out about something.
"What's the matter?" said Harry. "Wrong flavor?"
"No," said Ron shortly. "Why didn't you tell me about the gold?"
"What gold?" said Harry.
"The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup," said Ron. "The leprechaun
gold I gave you for my Omnioculars. In the Top Box. Why didn't you tell me it
disappeared?"
Harry had to think for a moment before he realized what Ron was talking about.
"Oh . . ." he said, the memory coming back to him at last. "I dunno ... I never
noticed it had gone. I was more worried about my wand, wasn't I?"
They climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the Great Hall for
lunch.
"Must be nice," Ron said abruptly, when they had sat down and started serving
themselves roast beef and Yorkshire puddings. "To have so much money you don't
notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing."
"Listen, I had other stuff on my mind that night!" s aid Harry impatiently. "We all
did, remember?"
"I didn't know leprechaun gold vanishes," Ron muttered. "I thought I was paying
you back. You shouldn't've given me that Chudley Cannon hat for Christmas."
"Forget it, all right?" said Harry.
Ron speared a roast potato on the end of his fork, glaring at it. Then he said, "I
352hate being poor."
Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Neither of them really knew what to
say.
"It's rubbish," said Ron, still glaring down at his potato. "I don't blame Fred and
George for trying to make some extra money. Wish I could. Wish I had a niffler."
"Well, we know what to get you next Christmas," said Hermione brightly. Then,
when Ron continued to look gloomy, she said, "Come on, Ron, it could be worse.
At least your fingers aren't full of pus." Hermione was having a lot of difficulty
managing her knife and fork, her fingers were so stiff and swollen. "I hate that
Skeeter woman!" she burst out savagely. "I'll get her back for this if it's the last
thing I do!"
Hate mail continued to arrive for Hermione over the following week, and although
she followed Hagrid's advice and stopped opening it, several of her ill-wishers sent
Howlers, which exploded at the Gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the
whole Hall to hear. Even those people who didn't read Witch Weekly knew all
about the supposed Harry-Krum-Hermione triangle now. Harry was getting sick of
telling people that Hermione wasn't his girlfriend.
"It'll die down, though," he told Hermione, "if we just ignore it. ... People got
bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time
"I want to know how she's listening into private conversations when she's
supposed to be banned from the grounds!" said Hermione angrily.
Hermione hung back in their next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson to ask
Professor Moody something. The rest of the class was very eager to leave; Moody
had given them such a rigorous test of hex-deflection that many of them were
nursing small injuries. Harry had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears, he had to hold
his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class.
"Well, Rita's definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak!" Hermione panted five
minutes later, catching up with Harry and Ron in the entrance hall and pulling
Harrys hand away from one of his wiggling ears so that he could hear her. "Moody
says he didn't see her anywhere near the judges' table at the second task, or
anywhere near the lake!"
"Hermione, is there any point in telling you to drop this?" said Ron.
"No!" said Hermione stubbornly. "I want to know how she heard me talking to
Viktor! And how she found out about Hagrids mum!"
"Maybe she had you bugged," said Harry.
"Bugged?" said Ron blankly. "What. . . put fleas on her or something?"
Harry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording equipment. Ron
353was fascinated, but Hermione interrupted them.
"Aren't you two ever going to read Hogwarts, A History^"
"What's the point?" said Ron. "You know it by heart, we can just ask you."
"All those substitutes for magic Muggles use - electricity, computers, and radar,
and all those things - they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there's too much magic
in the air. No, Rita's using magic to eavesdrop, she must be. ... If I could just find
out what it is ... ooh, if it's illegal, I'll have her ..."
"Haven't we got enough to worry about?" Ron asked her. "Do we have to start a
vendetta against Rita Skeeter as well?"
"I'm not asking you to help!" Hermione snapped. "I'll do it on my own!"
She marched back up the marble staircase without a backward glance. Harry was
quite sure she was going to the library.
"What's the betting she comes back with a box of / Hate Rita Skeeter badges?"
said Ron.
Hermione, however, did not ask Harry and Ron to help her pursue vengeance
against Rita Skeeter, for which they were both grateful, because their workload
was mounting ever higher in the days before the Easter holidays. Harry frankly
marveled at the fact that Hermione could research magical methods of
eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to do. He was working flat-out
just to get through all their homework, though he made a point of sending regular
food packages up to the cave in the mountain for Sirius; after last summer, Harry
had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry. He enclosed notes to
Sirius, telling him that nothing out of the ordinary had happened, and that they
were still waiting for an answer from Percy.
Hedwig didn't return until the end of the Easter holidays. Percy's letter was
enclosed in a package of Easter eggs that Mrs. Weasley had sent. Both Harrys and
Ron's were the size of dragon eggs and full of homemade toffee. Hermiones,
however, was smaller than a chicken egg. Her face fell when she saw it.
"Your mum doesn't read Witch Weekly, by any chance, does she, Ron?" she asked
quietly.
"Yeah," said Ron, whose mouth was full of toffee. "Gets it for the recipes."
Hermione looked sadly at her tiny egg.
"Don't you want to see what Percy's written?" Harry asked her hastily.
Percys letter was short and irritated.
As I am constantly telling the Daily Prophet, Mr. Crouch is taking a well-deserved
break. He is sending in regular owls with instructions. No, I haven't actually seen
354him, but I think I can be trusted to know my own superior's handwriting. I have
quite enough to do at the moment without trying to quash these ridiculous rumors.
Please don't bother me again unless it's something important. Happy Easter.
The start of the summer term would normally have meant that Harry was training
hard for the last Quidditch match of the season. This year, however, it was the
third and final task in the Triwizard Tournament for which he needed to prepare,
but he still didn't know what he would have to do. Finally, in the last week of
May, Professor McGonagall held him back in Transfiguration.
"You are to go down to the Quidditch field tonight at nine o'clock. Potter," she
told him. "Mr. Bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task."
So at half past eight that night. Harry left Ron and Hermione in Gryffindor Tower
and went downstairs. As he crossed the entrance hall, Cedric came up from the
Hufflepuff common room.
"What d'you reckon it's going to be?" he asked Harry as they went together down
the stone steps, out into the cloudy night. "Fleur keeps going on about
underground tunnels; she reckons we've got to find treasure."
"That wouldn't be too bad," said Harry, thinking that he would simply ask Hagrid
for a niffler to do the job for him.
They walked down the dark lawn to the Quidditch stadium, turned through a gap
in the stands, and walked out onto the field.
"What've they done to it?" Cedric said indignantly, stopping dead.
The Quidditch field was no longer smooth and flat. It looked as though somebody
had been building long, low walls all over it that twisted and crisscrossed in every
direction.
"They're hedges!" said Harry, bending to examine the nearest one.
"Hello there!" called a cheery voice.
Ludo Bagman was standing in the middle of the field with Krum and Fleur. Harry
and Cedric made their way toward them, climbing over the hedges. Fleur beamed
at Harry as he came nearer. Her attitude toward him had changed completely since
he had saved her sister from the lake.
"Well, what d'you think?" said Bagman happily as Harry and Cedric climbed over
the last hedge. "Growing nicely, aren't they? Give them a month and Hagrid'll
have them twenty feet high. Don't worry," he added, grinning, spotting the less-
than-happy expressions on Harrys and Cedric's faces, "you'll have your Quidditch
field back to normal once the task is over! Now, I imagine you can guess what
we're making here?"
No one spoke for a moment. Then -
355"Maze," grunted Krum.
"That's right!" said Bagman. "A maze. The third task's really very straightforward.
The Triwizard Cup will be placed in the center of the maze. The first champion to
touch it will receive full marks."
"We seemply 'ave to get through the maze?" said Fleur.
"There will be obstacles," said Bagman happily, bouncing on the balls of his feet.
"Hagrid is providing a number of creatures . . . then there will be spells that must
be broken ... all that sort of thing, you know. Now, the champions who are leading
on points will get a head start into the maze." Bagman grinned at Harry and
Cedric. "Then Mr. Krum will enter . . . then Miss Delacour. But you'll all be in
with a fighting chance, depending how well you get past the obstacles. Should be
fun, eh?"
Harry, who knew only too well the kind of creatures that Hagrid was likely to
provide for an event like this, thought it was unlikely to be any fun at all.
However, he nodded politely like the other champions.
"Very well. . . if you haven't got any questions, we'll go back up to the castle, shall
we, it's a bit chilly. ..."
Bagman hurried alongside Harry as they began to wend their way out of the
growing maze. Harry had the feeling that Bagman was going to start offering to
help him again, but just then, Krum tapped Harry on the shoulder.
"Could I haff a vord?"
"Yeah, all right," said Harry, slightly surprised.
"Vill you valk vith me?"
"Okay," said Harry curiously.
Bagman looked slightly perturbed.
"I'll wait for you. Harry, shall I?"
"No, it's okay, Mr. Bagman," said Harry, suppressing a smile, "I think I can find
the castle on my own, thanks."
Harry and Krum left the stadium together, but Krum did not set a course for the
Durmstrang ship. Instead, he walked toward the forest.
"What're we going this way for?" said Harry as they passed Hagrid s cabin and the
illuminated Beauxbatons carriage.
"Don't vont to be overheard," said Krum shortly.
When at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground a short way from the
356Beauxbatons horses' paddock, Krum stopped in the shade of the trees and turned to
face Harry.
"I vant to know," he said, glowering, "vot there is between you and Hermy-own-
ninny."
Harry, who from Krum's secretive manner had expected something much more
serious than this, stared up at Krum in amazement.
"Nothing," he said. But Krum glowered at him, and Harry, somehow struck anew
by how tall Krum was, elaborated. "We're friends. She's not my girlfriend and she
never has been. It's just that Skeeter woman making things up."
"Hermy-own-ninny talks about you very often," said Krum, looking suspiciously
at Harry.
"Yeah," said Harry, "because were friends."
He couldn't quite believe he was having this conversation with Viktor Krum, the
famous International Quidditch player. It was as though the eighteen-year-old
Krum thought he. Harry, was an equal - a real rival -
"You haff never . . . you haff not..."
"No," said Harry very firmly.
Krum looked slightly happier. He stared at Harry for a few seconds, then said,
"You fly very veil. I vos votching at the first task."
"Thanks," said Harry, grinning broadly and suddenly feeling much taller himself.
"I saw you at the Quidditch World Cup. The Wronski Feint, you really -"
But something moved behind Krum in the trees, and Harry, who had some
experience of the sort of thing that lurked in the forest, instinctively grabbed
Krum's arm and pulled him around.
"Vot is it?"
Harry shook his head, staring at the place where he'd seen movement. He slipped
his hand inside his robes, reaching for his wand.
Suddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak. For a moment, Harry didn't
recognize him . . . then he realized it was Mr. Crouch.
He looked as though he had been traveling for days. The knees of his robes were
ripped and bloody, his face scratched; he was unshaven and gray with exhaustion.
His neat hair and mustache were both in need of a wash and a trim. His strange
appearance, however, was nothing to the way he was behaving. Muttering and
gesticulating, Mr. Crouch appeared to be talking to someone that he alone could
see. He reminded Harry vividly of an old tramp he had seen once when out
shopping with the Dursleys. That man too had been conversing wildly with thin
357air; Aunt Petunia had seized Dudley's hand and pulled him across the road to avoid
him; Uncle Vernon had then treated the family to a long rant about what he would
like to do with beggars and vagrants.
"Vosn't he a judge?" said Krum, staring at Mr. Crouch. "Isn't he vith your
Ministry?"
Harry nodded, hesitated for a moment, then walked slowly toward Mr. Crouch,
who did not look at him, but continued to talk to a nearby tree.
"... and when you've done that, Weatherby, send an owl to Dumbledore confirming
the number of Durmstrang students who will be attending the tournament,
Karkaroff has just sent word there will be twelve. . . ."
"Mr. Crouch?" said Harry cautiously.
"... and then send another owl to Madame Maxime, because she might want to up
the number of students she's bringing, now Karkaroff's made it a round dozen ...
do that, Weatherby, will you? Will you? Will..."
Mr. Crouch's eyes were bulging. He stood staring at the tree, muttering
soundlessly at it. Then he staggered sideways and fell to his knees.
"Mr. Crouch?" Harry said loudly. "Are you all right?"
Crouch's eyes were rolling in his head. Harry looked around at Krum, who had
followed him into the trees, and was looking down at Crouch in alarm.
"Vot is wrong with him?"
"No idea," Harry muttered. "Listen, you'd better go and get someone -"
"Dumbledore!" gasped Mr. Crouch. He reached out and seized a handful of Harrys
robes, dragging him closer, though his eyes were staring over Harry's head. "I
need... see ... Dumbledore. ..."
"Okay," said Harry, "if you get up, Mr. Crouch, we can go up to the-"
"I've done . . . stupid . . . thing . . ." Mr. Crouch breathed. He looked utterly mad.
His eyes were rolling and bulging, and a trickle of spittle was sliding down his
chin. Every word he spoke seemed to cost him a terrible effort. "Must. . . tell. . .
Dumbledore . . ."
"Get up, Mr. Crouch," said Harry loudly and clearly. "Get up, I'll take you to
Dumbledore!"
Mr, Crouch's eyes rolled forward onto Harry.
"Who ... you?" he whispered.
"I'm a student at the school," said Harry, looking around at Krum for some help,
358but Krum was hanging back, looking extremely nervous.
"You're not... his?" whispered Crouch, his mouth sagging.
"No," said Harry, without the faintest idea what Crouch was talking about.
"Dumbledore's?"
"That's right," said Harry.
Crouch was pulling him closer; Harry tried to loosen Crouch's grip on his robes,
but it was too powerful.
"Warn ... Dumbledore ..."
"I'll get Dumbledore if you let go of me," said Harry. "Just let go, Mr. Crouch, and
I'll get him.. . ."
"Thank you, Weatherby, and when you have done that, I would like a cup of tea.
My wife and son will be arriving shortly, we are attending a concert tonight with
Mr. and Mrs. Fudge."
Crouch was now talking fluently to a tree again, and seemed completely unaware
that Harry was there, which surprised Harry so much he didn't notice that Crouch
had released him.
"Yes, my son has recently gained twelve O.W.L.S, most satisfactory, yes, thank
you, yes, very proud indeed. Now, if you could bring me that memo from the
Andorran Minister of Magic, I think I will have time to draft a response. ..."
"You stay here with him!" Harry said to Krum. "I'll get Dumbledore, I'll be
quicker, I know where his office is -"
"He is mad," said Krum doubtfully, staring down at Crouch, who was still
gabbling to the tree, apparently convinced it was Percy.
"Just stay with him," said Harry, starting to get up, but his movement seemed to
trigger another abrupt change in Mr. Crouch, who seized him hard around the
knees and pulled Harry back to the ground.
"Don't. . . leave .. . me!" he whispered, his eyes bulging again. "I... escaped .. .
must warn . . . must tell... see Dumbledore . . . my fault... all my fault. . . Bertha . .
. dead ... all my fault. .. my son ... my fault... tell Dumbledore ... Harry Potter ...
the Dark Lord . . . stronger . . . Harry Potter ..."
"I'll get Dumbledore if you let me go, Mr. Crouch!" said Harry. He looked
furiously around at Krum. "Help me, will you?"
Looking extremely apprehensive, Krum moved forward and squatted down next to
Mr. Crouch.
359"Just keep him here," said Harry, pulling himself free of Mr. Crouch. "I'll be back
with Dumbledore."
"Hurry, von't you?" Krum called after him as Harry sprinted away from the forest
and up through the dark grounds. They were deserted; Bagman, Cedric, and Fleur
had disappeared. Harry tore up the stone steps, through the oak front doors, and
off up the marble staircase, toward the second floor.
Five minutes later he was hurtling toward a stone gargoyle standing halfway along
an empty corridor.
"Sher - sherbet lemon!" he panted at it.
This was the password to the hidden staircase to Dumbledore's office - or at least,
it had been two years ago. The password had evidently changed, however, for the
stone gargoyle did not spring to life and jump aside, but stood frozen, glaring at
Harry malevolently.
"Move!" Harry shouted at it. "C'mon!"
But nothing at Hogwarts had ever moved just because he shouted at it; he knew it
was no good. He looked up and down the dark corridor. Perhaps Dumbledore was
in the staffroom? He started running as fast as he could toward the staircase -
"POTTER!"
Harry skidded to a halt and looked around. Snape had just emerged from the
hidden staircase behind the stone gargoyle. The wall was sliding shut behind him
even as he beckoned Harry back toward him.
"What are you doing here, Potter?"
"I need to see Professor Dumbledore!" said Harry, running back up the corridor
and skidding to a standstill in front of Snape instead. "It's Mr. Crouch . . . he's just
turned up ... he's in the forest... he's asking -"
"What is this rubbish?" said Snape, his black eyes glittering. "What are you talking
about?"
"Mr. Crouch!" Harry shouted. "From the Ministry! He's ill or something - he's in
the forest, he wants to see Dumbledore! Just give me the password up to -"
"The headmaster is busy. Potter," said Snape, his thin mouth curling into an
unpleasant smile.
"I've got to tell Dumbledore!" Harry yelled.
"Didn't you hear me. Potter?"
Harry could tell Snape was thoroughly enjoying himself, denying Harry the thing
he wanted when he was so panicky.
360"Look," said Harry angrily, "Crouch isn't right - he's - he's out of his mind - he
says he wants to warn -"
The stone wall behind Snape slid open. Dumbledore was standing there, wearing
long green robes and a mildly curious expression. "Is there a problem?" he said,
looking between Harry and Snape.
"Professor!" Harry said, sidestepping Snape before Snape could speak, "Mr.
Crouch is here - he's down in the forest, he wants to speak to you!"
Harry expected Dumbledore to ask questions, but to his relief, Dumbledore did
nothing of the sort.
"Lead the way," he said promptly, and he swept off along the corridor behind
Harry, leaving Snape standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as ugly.
"What did Mr. Crouch say. Harry?" said Dumbledore as they walked swiftly down
the marble staircase.
"Said he wants to warn you . . . said he's done something terrible ... he mentioned
his son . . . and Bertha Jorkins .. . and - and Voldemort. . . something about
Voldemort getting stronger. ..."
"Indeed," said Dumbledore, and he quickened his pace as they hurried out into the
pitch-darkness.
"He's not acting normally," Harry said, hurrying along beside Dumbledore. "He
doesn't seem to know where he is. He keeps talking like he thinks Percy Weasley's
there, and then he changes, and says he needs to see you. ... I left him with Viktor
Krum."
"You did?" said Dumbledore sharply, and he began to take longer strides still, so
that Harry was running to keep up. "Do you know if anybody else saw Mr.
Crouch?"
"No," said Harry. "Krum and I were talking, Mr. Bagman had just finished telling
us about the third task, we stayed behind, and then we saw Mr. Crouch coming out
of the forest -"
"Where are they?" said Dumbledore as the Beauxbatons carriage emerged from
the darkness.
"Over here," said Harry, moving in front of Dumbledore, leading the way through
the trees. He couldn't hear Crouch's voice anymore, but he knew where he was
going; it hadn't been much past the Beauxbatons carriage . . . somewhere around
here. . . .
"Viktor?" Harry shouted.
No one answered.
361"They were here," Harry said to Dumbledore. "They were definitely somewhere
around here. ..."
"Lumos," Dumbledore said, lighting his wand and holding it up.
Its narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black trunk, illuminating the ground.
And then it fell upon a pair of feet.
Harry and Dumbledore hurried forward. Krum was sprawled on the forest floor.
He seemed to be unconscious. There was no sign at all of Mr. Crouch.
Dumbledore bent over Krum and gently lifted one of his eyelids.
"Stunned," he said softly. His half-moon glasses glittered in the wandlight as he
peered around at the surrounding trees.
"Should I go and get someone?" said Harry. "Madam Pomfrey?"
"No," said Dumbledore swiftly. "Stay here."
He raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of Hagrid's cabin.
Harry saw something silvery dart out of it and streak away through the trees like a
ghostly bird. Then Dumbledore bent over Krum again, pointed his wand at him,
and muttered, "Ennervate."
Krum opened his eyes. He looked dazed. When he saw Dumbledore, he tried to sit
up, but Dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder and made him lie still.
"He attacked me!" Krum muttered, putting a hand up to his head. "The old
madman attacked me! I vos looking around to see vare Potter had gone and he
attacked from behind!"
"Lie still for a moment," Dumbledore said.
The sound of thunderous footfalls reached them, and Hagrid came panting into
sight with Fang at his heels. He was carrying his crossbow.
"Professor Dumbledore!" he said, his eyes widening. "Harry - what the - ?"
"Hagrid, I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff," said Dumbledore. "His student
has been attacked. When you've done that, kindly alert Professor Moody -"
"No need, Dumbledore," said a wheezy growl. "I'm here."
Moody was limping toward them, leaning on his staff, his wand lit.
"Damn leg," he said furiously. "Would've been here quicker . . . what's happened?
Snape said something about Crouch -"
"Crouch?" said Hagrid blankly.
"Karkaroff, please, Hagrid!" said Dumbledore sharply.
362"Oh yeah . .'. right y'are, Professor. . ." said Hagrid, and he turned and disappeared
into the dark trees, Fang trotting after him.
"I don't know where Barty Crouch is," Dumbledore told Moody, "but it is essential
that we find him."
"I'm onto it," growled Moody, and he pulled out his wand and limped off into the
forest.
Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke again until they heard the unmistakable
sounds of Hagrid and Fang returning. Karkaroff was hurrying along behind them.
He was wearing his sleek silver furs, and he looked pale and agitated.
"What is this?" he cried when he saw Krum on the ground and Dumbledore and
Harry beside him. "What's going on?"
"I vos attacked!" said Krum, sitting up now and rubbing his head. "Mr. Crouch or
votever his name -"
"Crouch attacked you? Crouch attacked you? The Triwizard judge?"
"Igor," Dumbledore began, but Karkaroff had drawn himself up, clutching his furs
around him, looking livid.
"Treachery!" he bellowed, pointing at Dumbledore. "It is a plot! You and your
Ministry of Magic have lured me here under false pretenses, Dumbledore! This is
not an equal competition! First you sneak Potter into the tournament, though he is
underage! Now one of your Ministry friends attempts to put my champion out of
action! I smell double-dealing and corruption in this whole affair, and you,
Dumbledore, you, with your talk of closer international
wizarding links, of rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences - here's what I
think of you!"
Karkaroff spat onto the ground at Dumbledore's feet. In one swift movement,
Hagrid seized the front of Karkaroff's furs, lifted him into the air, and slammed
him against a nearby tree.
"Apologize!" Hagrid snarled as Karkaroff gasped for breath, Hagrid's massive fist
at his throat, his feet dangling in midair.
"Hagrid, no!" Dumbledore shouted, his eyes flashing.
Hagrid removed the hand pinning Karkaroff to the tree, and Karkaroff slid all the
way down the trunk and slumped in a huddle at its roots; a few twigs and leaves
showered down upon his head.
"Kindly escort Harry back up to the castle, Hagrid," said Dumbledore sharply.
Breathing heavily, Hagrid gave Karkaroff a glowering look.
363"Maybe I'd better stay here. Headmaster. . . ."
"You will take Harry back to school, Hagrid," Dumbledore repeated firmly. "Take
him right up to Gryffindor Tower. And Harry - I want you to stay there. Anything
you might want to do - any owls you might want to send - they can wait until
morning, do you understand me?"
"Er - yes," said Harry, staring at him. How had Dumbledore known that, at that
very moment, he had been thinking about sending Pigwidgeon straight to Sirius, to
tell him what had happened?
"I'll leave Fang with yeh. Headmaster," Hagrid said, staring menacingly at
Karkaroff, who was still sprawled at the foot of the tree, tangled in furs and tree
roots. "Stay, Fang. C'mon, Harry."
They marched in silence past the Beauxbatons carriage and up toward the castle.
"How dare he," Hagrid growled as they strode past the lake. "How dare he accuse
Dumbledore. Like Dumbledore'd do anythin' like that. Like Dumbledore wanted
you in the tournament in the firs' place. Worried! I dunno when I seen Dumbledore
more worried than he's bin lately. An' you!" Hagrid suddenly said angrily to
Harry, who looked up at him, taken aback. "What were yeh doin', wanderin' off
with ruddy Krum? He's from Durmstrang, Harry! Coulda jinxed yeh right there,
couldn he? Hasn' Moody taught yeh nothin'? 'Magine lettin him lure yeh off on yer
own -"
"Krum's all right!" said Harry as they climbed the steps into the entrance hall. "He
wasn't trying to jinx me, he just wanted to talk about Hermione -"
"I'll be havin' a few words with her, an' all," said Hagrid grimly, stomping up the
stairs. "The less you lot 'ave ter do with these foreigners, the happier yeh'll be. Yeh
can trust any of 'em."
"You were getting on all right with Madame Maxime," Harry said, annoyed.
"Don' you talk ter me abou' her!" said Hagrid, and he looked quite frightening for
a moment. "I've got her number now! Tryin' ter get back in me good books, tryin'
ter get me ter tell her what's comin in the third task. Ha! You can' trust any of'em!"
Hagrid was in such a bad mood, Harry was quite glad to say good-bye to him in
front of the Fat Lady. He clambered through the portrait hole into the common
room and hurried straight for the corner where Ron and Hermione were sitting, to
tell them what had happened.
364CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE - THE DREAM
It comes down to this," said Hermione, rubbing her forehead. "Either Mr. Crouch
attacked Viktor, or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor wasn't
looking."
"It must've been Crouch," said Ron at once. "That's why he was gone when Harry
and Dumbledore got there. He'd done a runner."
"I don't think so," said Harry, shaking his head. "He seemed really weak - I don't
reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything."
"You cant Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven't I told you enough
times?" said Hermione.
"Okay. . . hows this for a theory," said Ron excitedly. "Krum attacked Crouch -
no, wait for it - and then Stunned himself!"
"And Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he?" said Hermione coldly.
"Oh yeah . . ."
It was daybreak. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had crept out of their dormitories very
early and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius. Now they
were standing looking out at the misty grounds. All three of them were puffy-eyed
and pale because they had been talking late into the night about Mr. Crouch.
"Just go through it again, Harry," said Hermione. "What did Mr. Crouch actually
say?"
"I've told you, he wasn't making much sense," said Harry. "He said he wanted to
warn Dumbledore about something. He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins, and
he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying stuff was his fault. . . . He
mentioned his son."
"Well, that was his fault," said Hermione testily.
"He was out of his mind," said Harry. "Half the time he seemed to think his wife
and son were still alive, and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving him
instructions."
"And . . . remind me what he said about You-Know-Who?" said Ron tentatively.
"I've told you," Harry repeated dully. "He said he's getting stronger."
There was a pause. Then Ron said in a falsely confident voice, "But he was out of
his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just raving. ..."
365"He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort," said Harry, and Ron
winced at the sound of the name. "He was having real trouble stringing two words
together, but that was when he seemed to know where he was, and know what he
wanted to do. He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore."
Harry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters. The many
perches were half-empty; every now and then, another owl would swoop in
through one of the windows, returning from its night's hunting with a mouse in its
beak.
"If Snape hadn't held me up," Harry said bitterly, "we might've got there in time.
'The headmaster is busy. Potter . . . what's this rubbish, Potter?' Why couldn't he
have just got out of the way?"
"Maybe he didn't want you to get there!" said Ron quickly. "Maybe - hang on -
how fast d'you reckon he could've gotten down to the forest? D'you reckon he
could've beaten you and Dumbledore there?"
"Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something," said Harry.
"Wouldn't put it past him," Ron muttered.
"We need to see Professor Moody," said Hermione. "We need to find out whether
he found Mr. Crouch,"
"If he had the Marauder's Map on him, it would've been easy," said Harry.
"Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds," said Ron, "because it only
shows up to the boundaries, doesn't -"
"Shh!" said Hermione suddenly.
Somebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery. Harry could hear two voices
arguing, coming closer and closer.
"- that's blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for that-"
"- we've tried being polite; it's time to play dirty, like him. He wouldn't like the
Ministry of Magic knowing what he did -"
"I'm telling you, if you put that in writing, it's blackmail!"
"Yeah, and you won't be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff, will you?"
The Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came over the threshold, then
froze at the sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
"What're you doing here?" Ron and Fred said at the same time.
"Sending a letter," said Harry and George in unison.
"What, at this time?" said Hermione and Fred.
366Fred grinned.
"Fine - we won't ask you what you're doing, if you don't ask us," he said.
He was holding a sealed envelope in his hands. Harry glanced at it, but Fred,
whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted his hand so that the name on it was
covered.
"Well, don't let us hold you up," Fred said, making a mock bow and pointing at the
door.
Ron didn't move. "Who're you blackmailing?" he said.
The grin vanished from Fred's face. Harry saw George half glance at Fred, before
smiling at Ron.
"Don't be stupid, I was only joking," he said easily.
"Didn't sound like that," said Ron.
Fred and George looked at each other. Then Fred said abruptly, "I've told you
before, Ron, keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is. Can't see why you
would, but -"
"It's my business if you're blackmailing someone," said Ron. "George's right, you
could end up in serious trouble for that."
"Told you, I was joking," said George. He walked over to Fred, pulled the letter
out of his hands, and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl. "You're
starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother, you are, Ron. Carry on like this
and you'll be made a prefect."
"No, I won't!" said Ron hotly.
George carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off. George turned
around and grinned at Ron.
"Well, stop telling people what to do then. See you later."
He and Fred left the Owlery. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another.
"You don't think they know something about all this, do you?" Hermione
whispered. "About Crouch and everything?"
"No," said Harry. "If it was something that serious, they'd tell someone. They'd tell
Dumbledore."
Ron, however, was looking uncomfortable.
"What's the matter?" Hermione asked him.
"Well. . ." said Ron slowly, "I dunno if they would. They're . . . they're obsessed
367with making money lately, I noticed it when I was hanging around with them -
when - you know -"
"We weren't talking." Harry finished the sentence for him. "Yeah, but blackmail..."
"It's this joke shop idea they've got," said Ron. "I thought they were only saying it
to annoy Mum, but they really mean it, they want to start one. They've only got a
year left at Hogwarts, they keep going on about how it's time to think about their
future, and Dad can't help them, and they need gold to get started."
Hermione was looking uncomfortable now.
"Yes, but. . . they wouldn't do anything against the law to get gold."
"Wouldn't they?" said Ron, looking skeptical. "I dunno . . . they don't exactly mind
breaking rules, do they?"
"Yes, but this is the law" said Hermione, looking scared. "This isn't some silly
school rule. . . . They'll get a lot more than detention for blackmail! Ron. . . maybe
you'd better tell Percy. . . ."
"Are you mad?" said Ron. "Tell Percy? He'd probably do a Crouch and turn them
in." He stared at the window through which Fred and George's owl had departed,
then said, "Come on, let's get some breakfast."
"D'you think it's too early to go and see Professor Moody?" Hermione said as they
went down the spiral staircase.
"Yes," said Harry. "He'd probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the
crack of dawn; he'll think we're trying to attack him while he's asleep. Let's give it
till break."
History of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept checking Ron's watch,
having finally discarded his own, but Ron's was moving so slowly he could have
sworn it had stopped working too. All three of them were so tired they could
happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept; even Hermione wasn't
taking her usual notes, but was sitting with her head on her hand, gazing at
Professor Binns with her eyes out of focus.
When the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors toward the Dark
Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leaving it. He looked as tired as they
felt. The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving his face an even more
lopsided appearance than usual.
"Professor Moody?" Harry called as they made their way toward him through the
crowd.
"Hello, Potter," growled Moody. His magical eye followed a couple of passing
first years, who sped up, looking nervous; it rolled into the back of Moody's head
and watched them around the corner before he spoke again.
368"Come in here."
He stood back to let them into his empty classroom, limped in after them, and
closed the door.
"Did you find him?" Harry asked without preamble. "Mr. Crouch?"
"No," said Moody. He moved over to his desk, sat down, stretched out his wooden
leg with a slight groan, and pulled out his hip flask.
"Did you use the map?" Harry said.
"Of course," said Moody, taking a swig from his flask. "Took a leaf out of your
book, Potter. Summoned it from my office into the forest. He wasn't anywhere on
there."
"So he did Disapparate?" said Ron.
"You can't Disapparate on the grounds, Ron!" said Hermione. "There are other
ways he could have disappeared, aren't there, Professor?"
Moody's magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione. "You're another one who
might think about a career as an Auror," he told her. "Mind works the right way.
Granger."
Hermione flushed pink with pleasure.
"Well, he wasn't invisible," said Harry. "The map shows invisible people. He
must've left the grounds, then."
"But under his own steam?" said Hermione eagerly, "or because someone made
him?"
"Yeah, someone could've - could've pulled him onto a broom and flown off with
him, couldn't they?" said Ron quickly, looking hopefully at Moody as if he too
wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror.
"We can't rule out kidnap," growled Moody.
"So," said Ron, "d'you reckon he's somewhere in Hogsmeade?"
"Could be anywhere," said Moody, shaking his head. "Only thing we know for
sure is that he's not here."
He yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and his lopsided mouth revealed a
number of missing teeth. Then he said, "Now, Dumbledore's told me you three
fancy yourselves as investigators, but there's nothing you can do for Crouch. The
Ministry'll be looking for him now, Dumbledore's notified them. Potter, you just
keep your mind on the third task."
"What?" said Harry. "Oh yeah . . ."
369He hadn't given the maze a single thought since he'd left it with Krum the previous
night.
"Should be right up your street, this one," said Moody, looking up at Harry and
scratching his scarred and stubbly chin. "From what Dumbledore's said, you've
managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times. Broke your way through a
series of obstacles guarding the Sorcerers Stone in your first year, didn't you?"
"We helped," Ron said quickly. "Me and Hermione helped."
Moody grinned.
"Well, help him practice for this one, and I'll be very surprised if he doesn't win,"
said Moody. "In the meantime .. . constant vigilance, Potter. Constant vigilance."
He took another long draw from his hip flask, and his magical eye swiveled onto
the window. The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was visible through it.
"You two," counseled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and Hermione, "you stick
close to Potter, all right? I'm keeping an eye on things, but all the same . . . you can
never have too many eyes out."
Sirius sent their owl back the very next morning. It fluttered down beside Harry at
the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of Hermione, clutching a copy
of the Daily Prophet in its beak. She took the newspaper, scanned the first few
pages, said, "Ha! She hasn't got wind of Crouch!" then joined Ron and Harry in
reading what Sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the night before last.
Harry - what do you think you are playing at, walking off into the forest with
Viktor Krum? I want you to swear, by return owl, that you are not going to go
walking with anyone else at night. There is somebody highly dangerous at
Hogwarts. It is clear to me that they wanted to stop Crouch from seeing
Dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark. You could
have been killed.
Your name didn't get into the Goblet of Fire by accident. If someone's trying to
attack you, they're on their last chance. Stay close to Ron and Hermione, do not
leave Gryffindor Tower after hours, and arm yourself for the third task. Practice
Stunning and Disarming. A few hexes wouldn't go amiss either. There's nothing
you can do about Crouch. Keep your head down and look after yourself. I'm
waiting for your letter giving me your word you won't stray out-of-bounds again.
Sirius
"Who's he, to lecture me about being out-of-bounds?" said Harry in mild
indignation as he folded up Sirius's letter and put it inside his robes. "After all the
stuff he did at school!"
"He's worried about you!" said Hermione sharply. "Just like Moody and Hagrid!
So listen to them!"
370"No one's tried to attack me all year," said Harry. "No one's done anything to me
at
all-"
"Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire," said Hermione. "And they must've
done that for a reason. Harry. Snuffles is right. Maybe they've been biding their
time. Maybe this is the task they're going to get you."
"Look," said Harry impatiently, "let's say Sirius is right, and someone Stunned
Krum to kidnap Crouch. Well, they would've been in the trees near us, wouldn't
they? But they waited till I was out of the way until they acted, didn't they? So it
doesn't look like I'm their target, does it?"
"They couldn't have made it look like an accident if they'd murdered you in the
forest!" said Hermione. "But if you die during a task-"
"They didn't care about attacking Krum, did they?" said Harry. "Why didn't they
just polish me off at the same time? They could've made it look like Krum and I
had a duel or something."
"Harry, I don't understand it either," said Hermione desperately. "I just know there
are a lot of odd things going on, and I don't like it. ... Moody's right - Sirius is right
- you've got to get in training for the third task, straight away. And you make sure
you write back to Sirius and promise him you're not going to go sneaking off alone
again."
The Hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when Harry had to stay
indoors. For the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library
with Hermione and Ron, looking up hexes, or else in empty classrooms, which
they sneaked into to practice. Harry was concentrating on the Stunning Spell,
which he had never used before. The trouble was that practicing it involved certain
sacrifices on Ron's and Hermione's part.
"Can't we kidnap Mrs. Norris?" Ron suggested on Monday lunchtime as he lay flat
on his back in the middle of their Charms classroom, having just been Stunned and
reawoken by Harry for the fifth time in a row. "Let's Stun her for a bit. Or you
could use Dobby, Harry, I bet he'd do anything to help you. I'm not complaining or
anything" - he got gingerly to his feet, rubbing his backside - "but I'm aching all
over. ..."
"Well, you keep missing the cushions, don't you!" said Hermione impatiently,
rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the Banishing Spell, which
Flitwick had left in a cabinet. "Just try and fall backward!"
"Once you're Stunned, you can't aim too well, Hermione! "said Ron angrily. "Why
don't you take a turn?"
"Well, I think Harry's got it now, anyway," said Hermione hastily. "And we don't
371have to worry about Disarming, because he's been able to do that for ages. ... I
think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening."
She looked down the list they had made in the library.
"I like the look of this one," she said, "this Impediment Curse. Should slow down
anything that's trying to attack you. Harry. We'll start with that one."
The bell rang. They hastily shoved the cushions back into Flitwicks cupboard and
slipped out of the classroom.
"See you at dinner!" said Hermione, and she set off for Arithmancy, while Harry
and Ron headed toward North Tower, and Divination. Broad strips of dazzling
gold sunlight tell across the corridor from the high windows. The sky outside was
so brightly blue it looked as though it had been enameled.
"It's going to be boiling in Trelawney's room, she never puts out that fire," said
Ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor.
He was quite right. The dimly lit room was swelteringly hot. The fumes from the
perfumed fire were heavier than ever. Harrys head swam as he made his way over
to one of the curtained windows. While Professor Trelawney was looking the
other way, disentangling her shawl from a lamp, he opened it an inch or so and
settled back in his chintz armchair, so that a soft breeze played across his face. It
was extremely comfortable.
"My dears," said Professor Trelawney, sitting down in her winged armchair in
front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes,
"we have almost finished our work on planetary divination. Today, however, will
be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of Mars, for he is placed most
interestingly at the present time. If you will all look this way, I will dim the lights.
. . ."
She waved her wand and the lamps went out. The fire was the only source of light
now. Professor Trelawney bent down and lifted, from under her chair, a miniature
model of the solar system, contained within a glass dome. It was a beautiful thing;
each of the moons glimmered in place around the nine planets and the fiery sun,
all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass. Harry watched lazily as Professor
Trelawney began to point out the fascinating angle Mars was making to Neptune.
The heavily perfumed fumes washed over him, and the breeze from the window
played across his face. He could hear an insect humming gently somewhere
behind the curtain. His eyelids began to droop. . . .
He was riding on the back of an eagle owl, soaring through the clear blue sky
toward an old, ivy-covered house set high on a hillside. Lower and lower they
flew, the wind blowing pleasantly in Harry's face, until they reached a dark and
broken window in the upper story of the house and entered. Now they were flying
along a gloomy passageway, to a room at the very end . . . through the door they
went, into a dark room whose windows were boarded up....
372Harry had left the owl's back... he was watching, now, as it fluttered across the
room, into a chair with its back to him. . . . There were two dark shapes on the
floor beside the chair . . . both of them were stirring. . . .
One was a huge snake . . . the other was a man ... a short, balding man, a man with
watery eyes and a pointed nose ... he was wheezing and sobbing on the hearth rug.
...
"You are in luck, Wormtail," said a cold, high-pitched voice from the depths of the
chair in which the owl had landed. "You are very fortunate indeed. Your blunder
has not ruined everything. He is dead."
"My Lord!" gasped the man on the floor. "My Lord, I am ... I am so pleased . . .
and so sorry. ..."
"Nagini," said the cold voice, "you are out of luck. I will not be feeding Wormtail
to you, after all... but never mind, never mind . . . there is still Harry Potter. ..."
The snake hissed. Harry could see its tongue fluttering.
"Now, Wormtail," said the cold voice, "perhaps one more little reminder why I
will not tolerate another blunder from you. ..."
"My Lord ... no ... I beg you . . ."
The tip of a wand emerged from around the back of the chair. It was pointing at
Wormtail.
"Crucio!" said the cold voice.
Wormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve in his body were on fire, the
screaming filled Harry's ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain; he was
yelling too...Voldemort would hear him, would know he was there. . . .
"Harry! Harry!"
Harry opened his eyes. He was lying on the floor of Professor Trelawney's room
with his hands over his face. His scar was still burning so badly that his eyes were
watering. The pain had been real. The whole class was standing around him, and
Ron was kneeling next to him, looking terrified.
"You all right?" he said.
"Of course he isn't!" said Professor Trelawney, looking thoroughly excited. Her
great eyes loomed over Harry, gazing at him. "What was it. Potter? A
premonition? An apparition? What did you see?"
"Nothing," Harry lied. He sat up. He could feel himself shaking. He couldn't stop
himself from looking around, into the shadows behind him; Voldemorts voice had
sounded so close. . . .
373"You were clutching your scar!" said Professor Trelawney. "You were rolling on
the floor, clutching your scar! Come now. Potter, I have experience in these
matters!"
Harry looked up at her.
"I need to go to the hospital wing, I think," he said. "Bad headache."
"My dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant
vibrations of my room!" said Professor Trelawney. "If you leave now, you may
lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever -"
"I don't want to see anything except a headache cure," said Harry.
He stood up. The class backed away. They all looked unnerved.
"See you later," Harry muttered to Ron, and he picked up his bag and headed for
the trapdoor, ignoring Professor Trelawney, who was wearing an expression of
great frustration, as though she had just been denied a real treat.
When Harry reached the bottom of her stepladder, however, he did not set off for
the hospital wing. He had no intention whatsoever of going there. Sirius had told
him what to do if his scar hurt him again, and Harry was going to follow his
advice: He was going straight to Dumbledore's office. He marched down the
corridors, thinking about what he had seen in the dream . . . it had been as vivid as
the one that had awoken him on Privet Drive. . . . He ran over the details in his
mind, trying to make sure he could remember them. . . . He had heard Voldemort
accusing Wormtail of making a blunder . . . but the owl had brought good news,
the blunder had been repaired, somebody was dead ... so Wormtail was not going
to be fed to the snake . . . he, Harry, was going to be fed to it instead. . . .
Harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to
Dumbledores office without noticing. He blinked, looked around, realized what he
had done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of it. Then he remembered that
he didn't know the password.
"Sherbet lemon?" he tried tentatively.
The gargoyle did not move.
"Okay," said Harry, staring at it, "Pear Drop. Er - Licorice Wand. Fizzing
Whizbee. Drooble's Best Blowing Gum. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans ... oh
no, he doesn't like them, does he?... oh just open, can't you?" he said angrily. "I
really need to see him, its urgent!"
The gargoyle remained immovable.
Harry kicked it, achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in his big toe.
"Chocolate Frog!" he yelled angrily, standing on one leg. "Sugar Quill! Cockroach
374Cluster!"
The gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside. Harry blinked.
"Cockroach Cluster?" he said, amazed. "I was only joking. ..."
He hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto the foot of a spiral stone
staircase, which moved slowly upward as the doors closed behind him, taking him
up to a polished oak door with a brass door knocker.
He could hear voices from inside the office. He stepped off the moving staircase
and hesitated, listening.
"Dumbledore, I'm afraid I don't see the connection, don't see it at all!" It was the
voice of the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. "Ludo says Berthas perfectly
capable of getting herself lost. I agree we would have expected to have found her
by now, but all the same, we've no evidence of foul play, Dumbledore, none at all.
As for her disappearance being linked with Barty Crouch's!"
"And what do you thinks happened to Barty Crouch, Minister?" said Moody's
growling voice.
"I see two possibilities, Alastor," said Fudge. "Either Crouch has finally cracked -
more than likely, I'm sure you'll agree, given his personal history - lost his mind,
and gone wandering off somewhere -"
"He wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case, Cornelius," said Dumbledore
calmly.
"Or else - well..." Fudge sounded embarrassed. "Well, I'll reserve judgment until
after I've seen the place where he was found, but you say it was just past the
Beauxbatons carriage? Dumbledore, you know what that woman is?"
"I consider her to be a very able headmistress - and an excellent dancer," said
Dumbledore quietly.
"Dumbledore, come!" said Fudge angrily. "Don't you think you might be
prejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid? They don't all turn out harmless - if,
indeed, you can call Hagrid harmless, with that monster fixation he's got -"
"I no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid," said Dumbledore, just as
calmly. "I think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced, Cornelius."
"Can we wrap up this discussion?" growled Moody.
"Yes, yes, let's go down to the grounds, then," said Fudge impatiently.
"No, it's not that," said Moody, "it's just that Potter wants a word with you,
Dumbledore. He's just outside the door."
375CHAPTER THIRTY - THE PENSIEVE
The door of the office opened.
"Hello, Potter," said Moody. "Come in, then."
Harry walked inside. He had been inside Dumbledore's office once before; it was a
very beautiful, circular room, lined with pictures of previous headmasters and
headmistresses of Hogwarts, all of whom were fast asleep, their chests rising and
falling gently.
Cornelius Fudge was standing beside Dumbledore's desk, wearing his usual
pinstriped cloak and holding his lime-green bowler hat.
"Harry!" said Fudge jovially, moving forward. "How are you?"
"Fine," Harry lied.
"We were just talking about the night when Mr. Crouch turned up on the grounds,"
said Fudge. "It was you who found him, was it not?"
"Yes," said Harry. Then, feeling it was pointless to pretend that he hadn't
overheard what they had been saying, he added, "I didn't see Madame Maxime
anywhere, though, and she'd have a job hiding, wouldn't she?"
Dumbledore smiled at Harry behind Fudge's back, his eyes twinkling.
"Yes, well," said Fudge, looking embarrassed, "we're about to go for a short walk
on the grounds, Harry, if you'll excuse us ... perhaps if you just go back to your
class -"
"I wanted to talk to you. Professor," Harry said quickly, looking at Dumbledore,
who gave him a swift, searching look.
"Wait here for me, Harry," he said. "Our examination of the grounds will not take
long."
They trooped out in silence past him and closed the door. After a minute or so,
Harry heard the clunks of Moody's wooden leg growing fainter in the corridor
below. He looked around.
"Hello, Fawkes," he said.
Fawkes, Professor Dumbledore's phoenix, was standing on his golden perch beside
the door. The size of a swan, with magnificent scarlet-and-gold plumage, he
swished his long tail and blinked benignly at Harry.
Harry sat down in a chair in front of Dumbledore's desk. For several minutes, he
376sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their frames,
thinking about what he had just heard, and running his fingers over his scar. It had
stopped hurting now.
He felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in Dumbledore's office, knowing
he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at the walls
behind the desk. The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing on a shelf. A
glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the
hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the Sorting
Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged to Godric Gryffindor,
founder of Harry's House. He was gazing at it, remembering how it had come to
his aid when he had thought all hope was lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery
light, dancing and shimmering on the glass case. He looked around for the source
of the light and saw a sliver of silver-white shining brightly from within a black
cabinet behind him, whose door had not been closed properly. Harry hesitated,
glanced at Fawkes, then got up, walked across the office, and pulled open the
cabinet door.
A shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge: runes and
symbols that Harry did not recognize. The silvery light was coming from the
basin's contents, which were like nothing Harry had ever seen before. He could not
tell whether the substance was liquid or gas. It was a bright, whitish silver, and it
was moving ceaselessly; the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind,
and then, like clouds, separated and swirled smoothly. It looked like light made
liquid - or like wind made solid - Harry couldn't make up his mind.
He wanted to touch it, to find out what it felt like, but nearly four years' experience
of the magical world told him that sticking his hand into a bowl full of some
unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do. He therefore pulled his wand
out of the inside of his robes, cast a nervous look around the office, looked back at
the contents of the basin, and prodded them.
The surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fast.
Harry bent closer, his head right inside the cabinet. The silvery substance had
become transparent; it looked like glass. He looked down into it expecting to see
the stone bottom of the basin - and saw instead an enormous room below the
surface of the mysterious substance, a room into which he seemed to be looking
through a circular window in the ceiling.
The room was dimly lit; he thought it might even be underground, for there were
no windows, merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated the walls
of Hogwarts. Lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the
glassy substance, Harry saw that rows and rows of witches and wizards were
seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in levels. An empty
chair stood in the very center of the room. There was something about the chair
that gave Harry an ominous feeling. Chains encircled the arms of it, as though its
occupants were usually tied to it.
377Where was this place? It surely wasn't Hogwarts; he had never seen a room like
that here in the castle. Moreover, the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom
of the basin was comprised of adults, and Harry knew there were not nearly that
many teachers at Hogwarts. They seemed, he thought, to be waiting for
something; even though he could only see the tops of their hats, all of their faces
seemed to be pointing in one direction, and none of them were talking to one
another.
The basin being circular, and the room he was observing square, Harry could not
make out what was going on in the corners of it. He leaned even closer, tilting his
head, trying to see...
The tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he was staring.
Dumbledore's office gave an almighty lurch - Harry was thrown forward and
pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin -
But his head did not hit the stone bottom. He was falling through something icy-
cold and black; it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool -
And suddenly, Harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end of the room
inside the basin, a bench raised high above the others. He looked up at the high
stone ceiling, expecting to see the circular window through which he had just been
staring, but there was nothing there but dark, solid stone.
Breathing hard and fast. Harry looked around him. Not one of the witches and
wizards in the room (and there were at least two hundred of them) was looking at
him. Not one of them seemed to have noticed that a fourteen-year-old boy had just
dropped from the ceiling into their midst. Harry turned to the wizard next to him
on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated around the silent
room.
He was sitting right next to Albus Dumbledore.
"Professor!" Harry said in a kind of strangled whisper. "I'm sorry - I didn't mean to
- I was just looking at that basin in your cabinet - I - where are we?"
But Dumbledore didn't move or speak. He ignored Harry completely. Like every
other wizard on the benches, he was staring into the far corner of the room, where
there was a door.
Harry gazed, nonplussed, at Dumbledore, then around at the silently watchful
crowd, then back at Dumbledore. And then it dawned on him. . . .
Once before. Harry had found himself somewhere that nobody could see or hear
him. That time, he had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary, right into
somebody else's memory . . . and unless he was very much mistaken, something of
the sort had happened again...
Harry raised his right hand, hesitated, and then waved it energetically in from of
378Dumbledore's face. Dumbledore did not blink, look around at Harry, or indeed
move at all. And that, in Harry's opinion, settled the matter. Dumbledore wouldn't
ignore him like that. He was inside a memory, and this was not the present-day
Dumbledore. Yet it couldn't be that long ago . . . the Dumbledore sitting next to
him now was silver-haired, just like the present-day Dumbledore. But what was
this place? What were all these wizards waiting for?
Harry looked around more carefully. The room, as he had suspected when
observing it from above, was almost certainly underground - more of a dungeon
than a room, he thought. There was a bleak and forbidding air about the place;
there were no pictures on the walls, no decorations at all; just these serried rows of
benches, rising in levels all around the room, all positioned so that they had a clear
view of that chair with the chains on its arms.
Before Harry could reach any conclusions about the place in which they were, he
heard footsteps. The door in the corner of the dungeon opened and three people
entered - or at least one man, flanked by two dementors.
Harry's insides went cold. The dementors - tall, hooded creatures whose faces
were concealed - were gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the room,
each grasping one of the man's arms with their dead and rotten-looking hands. The
man between them looked as though he was about to faint, and Harry couldn't
blame him ... he knew the dementors could not touch him inside a memory, but he
remembered their power only too well. The watching crowd recoiled slightly as
the dementors placed the man in the chained chair and glided back out of the
room. The door swung shut behind them.
Harry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair and saw that it was
Karkaroff.
Unlike Dumbledore, Karkaroff looked much younger; his hair and goatee were
black. He was not dressed in sleek furs, but in thin and ragged robes. He was
shaking. Even as Harry watched, the chains on the arms of the chair glowed
suddenly gold and snaked their way up Karkaroff's arms, binding him there.
"Igor Karkaroff," said a curt voice to Harry's left. Harry looked around and saw
Mr. Crouch standing up in the middle of the bench beside him. Crouch's hair was
dark, his face was much less lined, he looked fit and alert. "You have been brought
from Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic. You have given us to
understand that you have important information for us."
Karkaroff straightened himself as best he could, tightly bound to the chair.
"I have, sir," he said, and although his voice was very scared, Harry could still
hear the familiar unctuous note in it. "I wish to be of use to the Ministry. I wish to
help. I - I know that the Ministry is trying to - to round up the last of the Dark
Lords supporters. I am eager to assist in any way I can. ..."
There was a murmur around the benches. Some of the wizards and witches were
379surveying Karkaroff with interest, others with pronounced mistrust. Then Harry
heard, quite distinctly, from Dumbledores other side, a familiar, growling voice
saying, "Filth."
Harry leaned forward so that he could see past Dumbledore. Mad-Eye Moody was
sitting there - except that there was a very noticeable difference in his appearance.
He did not have his magical eye, but two normal ones. Both were looking down
upon Karkaroff, and both were narrowed in intense dislike.
"Crouch is going to let him out," Moody breathed quietly to Dumbledore. "He's
done a deal with him. Took me six months to track him down, and Crouch is going
to let him go if he's got enough new names. Let's hear his information, I say, and
throw him straight back to the dementors."
Dumbledore made a small noise of dissent through his long, crooked nose.
"Ah, I was forgetting . . . you don't like the dementors, do you, Albus?" said
Moody with a sardonic smile.
"No," said Dumbledore calmly, "I'm afraid I don't. I have long felt the Ministry is
wrong to ally itself with such creatures."
"But for filth like this . . ." Moody said softly.
"You say you have names for us, Karkaroff," said Mr. Crouch. "Let us hear them,
please."
"You must understand," said Karkaroff hurriedly, "that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-
Named operated always in the greatest secrecy. . . . He preferred that we - I mean
to say, his supporters - and I regret now, very deeply, that I ever counted myself
among them -"
"Get on with it," sneered Moody.
"- we never knew the names of every one of our fellows - He alone knew exactly
who we all were -"
"Which was a wise move, wasn't it, as it prevented someone like you, Karkaroff,
from turning all of them in," muttered Moody.
"Yet you say you have some names for us?" said Mr. Crouch.
"I - I do," said Karkaroff breathlessly. "And these were important supporters, mark
you. People I saw with my own eyes doing his bidding. I give this information as a
sign that I fully and totally renounce him, and am filled with a remorse so deep I
can barely -"
"These names are?" said Mr. Crouch sharply.
Karkaroff drew a deep breath.
380"There was Antonin Dolohov," he said. "I - I saw him torture countless Muggles
and - and non-supporters of the Dark Lord."
"And helped him do it," murmured Moody.
"We have already apprehended Dolohov," said Crouch. "He was caught shortly
after yourself."
"Indeed?" said Karkaroff, his eyes widening. "I - I am delighted to hear it!"
But he didn't look it. Harry could tell that this news had come as a real blow to
him. One of his names was worthless.
"Any others?" said Crouch coldly.
"Why, yes ... there was Rosier," said Karkaroff hurriedly. "Evan Rosier."
"Rosier is dead," said Crouch. "He was caught shortly after you were too. He
preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle."
"Took a bit of me with him, though," whispered Moody to Harry's right. Harry
looked around at him once more, and saw him indicating the large chunk out of his
nose to Dumbledore.
"No - no more than Rosier deserved!" said Karkaroff, a real note of panic in his
voice now. Harry could see that he was starting to worry that none of his
information would be of any use to the Ministry. Karkaroff's eyes darted toward
the door in the corner, behind which the dementors undoubtedly still stood,
waiting.
"Any more?" said Crouch.
"Yes!" said Karkaroff. "There was Travers - he helped murder the McKinnons!
Mulciber - he specialized in the Imperius Curse, forced countless people to do
horrific things! Rookwood, who was a spy, and passed He-Who-Must-Not-Be-
Named useful information from inside the Ministry itself!"
Harry could tell that, this time, Karkaroff had struck gold. The watching crowd
was all murmuring together.
"Rookwood?" said Mr. Crouch, nodding to a witch sitting in front of him, who
began scribbling upon her piece of parchment. "Augustus Rookwood of the
Department of Mysteries?"
"The very same," said Karkaroff eagerly. "I believe he used a network of well-
placed wizards, both inside the Ministry and out, to collect information -"
"But Travers and Mulciber we have," said Mr. Crouch. "Very well, Karkaroff, if
that is all, you will be returned to Azkaban while we decide -"
"Not yet!" cried Karkaroff, looking quite desperate. "Wait, I have more!"
381Harry could see him sweating in the torchlight, his white skin contrasting strongly
with the black of his hair and beard.
"Snape!" he shouted. "Severus Snape!"
"Snape has been cleared by this council," said Crouch disdainfully. "He has been
vouched for by Albus Dumbledore."
"No!" shouted Karkaroff, straining at the chains that bound him to the chair. "I
assure you! Severus Snape is a Death Eater!"
Dumbledore had gotten to his feet.
"I have given evidence already on this matter," he said calmly. "Severus Snape
was indeed a Death Eater. However, he rejoined our side before Lord Voldemort's
downfall and turned spy for us, at great personal risk. He is now no more a Death
Eater than I am."
Harry turned to look at Mad-Eye Moody. He was wearing a look of deep
skepticism behind Dumbledore's back.
"Very well, Karkaroff," Crouch said coldly, "you have been of assistance. I shall
review your case. You will return to Azkaban in the meantime. ..."
Mr. Crouch's voice faded. Harry looked around; the dungeon was dissolving as
though it were made of smoke; everything was fading; he could see only his own
body - all else was swirling darkness. . . .
And then, the dungeon returned. Harry was sitting in a different seat, still on the
highest bench, but now to the left side of Mr. Crouch. The atmosphere seemed
quite different: relaxed, even cheerful. The witches and wizards all around the
walls were talking to one another, almost as though they were at some sort of
sporting event. Harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of benches opposite.
She had short blonde hair, was wearing magenta robes, and was sucking the end of
an acid-green quill. It was, unmistakably, a younger Rita Skeeter. Harry looked
around; Dumbledore was sitting beside him again, wearing different robes. Mr.
Crouch looked more tired and somehow fiercer, gaunter. . . . Harry understood. It
was a different memory, a different day ... a different trial.
The door in the corner opened, and Ludo Bagman walked into the room.
This was not, however, a Ludo Bagman gone to seed, but a Ludo Bagman who
was clearly at the height of his Quidditch-playing fitness. His nose wasn't broken
now; he was tall and lean and muscular. Bagman looked nervous as he sat down in
the chained chair, but it did not bind him there as it had bound Karkaroff, and
Bagman, perhaps taking heart from this, glanced around at the watching crowd,
waved at a couple of them, and managed a small smile.
"Ludo Bagman, you have been brought here in front of the Council of Magical
Law to answer charges relating to the activities of the Death Eaters," said Mr.
382Crouch. "We have heard the evidence against you, and are about to reach our
verdict. Do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce
judgment?"
Harry couldn't believe his ears. Ludo Bagman, a Death Eater?
"Only," said Bagman, smiling awkwardly, "well - I know I've been a bit of an idiot
-"
One or two wizards and witches in the surrounding seats smiled indulgently. Mr.
Crouch did not appear to share their feelings. He was staring down at Ludo
Bagman with an expression of the utmost severity and dislike.
"You never spoke a truer word, boy," someone muttered dryly to Dumbledore
behind Harry. He looked around and saw Moody sitting there again. "If I didn't
know he'd always been dim, I'd have said some of those Bludgers had permanently
affected his brain. ..."
"Ludovic Bagman, you were caught passing information to Lord Voldemort's
supporters," said Mr. Crouch. "For this, I suggest a term of imprisonment in
Azkaban lasting no less than -"
But there was an angry outcry from the surrounding benches. Several of the
witches and wizards around the walls stood up, shaking their heads, and even their
fists, at Mr. Crouch.
"But I've told you, I had no idea!" Bagman called earnestly over the crowd's
babble, his round blue eyes widening. "None at all! Old Rookwood was a friend of
my dad's . . . never crossed my mind he was in with You-Know-Who! I thought I
was collecting information for our side! And Rookwood kept talking about getting
me a job in the Ministry later on ... once my Quidditch days are over, you know ...
I mean, I can't keep getting hit by Bludgers for the rest of my life, can I?"
There were titters from the crowd.
"It will be put to the vote," said Mr. Crouch coldly. He turned to the right-hand
side of the dungeon. "The jury will please raise their hands . . . those in favor of
imprisonment..."
Harry looked toward the right-hand side of the dungeon. Not one person raised
their hand. Many of the witches and wizards around the walls began to clap. One
of the witches on the jury stood up.
"Yes?" barked Crouch.
"We'd just like to congratulate Mr. Bagman on his splendid performance for
England in the Quidditch match against Turkey last Saturday," the witch said
breathlessly.
Mr. Crouch looked furious. The dungeon was ringing with applause now. Bagman
383got to his feet and bowed, beaming.
"Despicable," Mr. Crouch spat at Dumbledore, sitting down as Bagman walked
out of the dungeon. "Rookwood get him a job indeed. . . . The day Ludo Bagman
joins us will be a sad day indeed for the Ministry. . . ."
And the dungeon dissolved again. When it had returned, Harry looked around. He
and Dumbledore were still sitting beside Mr. Crouch, but the atmosphere could not
have been more different. There was total silence, broken only by the dry sobs of a
frail, wispy-looking witch in the seat next to Mr. Crouch. She was clutching a
handkerchief to her mouth with trembling hands.
Harry looked up at Crouch and saw that he looked gaunter and grayer than ever
before. A nerve was twitching in his temple.
"Bring them in," he said, and his voice echoed through the silent dungeon.
The door in the corner opened yet again. Six dementors entered this time, flanking
a group of four people. Harry saw the people in the crowd turn to look up at Mr.
Crouch. A few of them whispered to one another.
The dementors placed each of the four people in the four chairs with chained arms
that now stood on the dungeon floor. There was a thickset man who stared blankly
up at Crouch; a thinner and more nervous-looking man, whose eyes were darting
around the crowd; a woman with thick, shining dark hair and heavily hooded eyes,
who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne; and a boy in his
late teens, who looked nothing short of petrified. He was shivering, his straw-
colored hair all over his face, his freckled skin milk-white. The wispy little witch
beside Crouch began to rock backward and forward in her seat, whimpering into
her handkerchief.
Crouch stood up. He looked down upon the four in front of him, and there was
pure hatred in his face.
"You have been brought here before the Council of Magical Law," he said clearly,
"so that we may pass judgment on you, for a crime so heinous -"
"Father," said the boy with the straw-colored hair. "Father. . .please . . .
"- that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court," said Crouch, speaking
more loudly, drowning out his son's voice.
"We have heard the evidence against you. The four of you stand accused of
capturing an Auror - Frank Longbottom - and subjecting him to the Cruciatus
Curse, believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled
master, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named -"
"Father, I didn't!" shrieked the boy in chains below. "I didn't, I swear it. Father,
don't send me back to the dementors -"
384"You are further accused," bellowed Mr. Crouch, "of using the Cruciatus Curse on
Frank Longbottom's wife, when he would not give you information. You planned
to restore He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to power, and to resume the lives of
violence you presumably led while he was strong. I now ask the jury -"
"Mother!" screamed the boy below, and the wispy little witch beside Crouch
began to sob, rocking backward and forward. "Mother, stop him. Mother, I didn't
do it, it wasn't me!"
"I now ask the jury," shouted Mr. Crouch, "to raise their hands if they believe, as I
do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban!"
In unison, the witches and wizards along the right-hand side of the dungeon raised
their hands. The crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for Bagman, their
faces full of savage triumph. The boy began to scream.
"No! Mother, no! I didn't do it, I didn't do it, I didn't know! Don't send me there,
don't let him!"
The dementors were gliding back into the room. The boys' three companions rose
quietly from their seats; the woman with the heavy-lidded eyes looked up at
Crouch and called, "The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch! Throw us into
Azkaban; we will wait! He
will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other
supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to find him!"
But the boy was trying to fight off the dementors, even though Harry could see
their cold, draining power starting to affect him. The crowd was jeering, some of
them on their feet, as the woman swept out of the dungeon, and the boy continued
to struggle.
"I'm your son!" he screamed up at Crouch. "I'm your son!"
"You are no son of mine!" bellowed Mr. Crouch, his eyes bulging suddenly. "I
have no son!"
The wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and slumped in her seat. She had
fainted. Crouch appeared not to have noticed.
"Take them away!" Crouch roared at the dementors, spit flying from his mouth.
"Take them away, and may they rot there!"
"Father! Father, I wasn't involved! No! No! Father, please!"
"I think. Harry, it is time to return to my office," said a quiet voice in Harrys ear.
Harry started. He looked around. Then he looked on his other side.
There was an Albus Dumbledore sitting on his right, watching Crouch's son being
dragged away by the dementors - and there was an Albus Dumbledore on his left,
385looking right at him.
"Come," said the Dumbledore on his left, and he put his hand under Harrys elbow.
Harry felt himself rising into the air; the dungeon dissolved around him; for a
moment, all was blackness, and then he felt as though he had done a slow-motion
somersault, suddenly landing flat on his feet, in what seemed like the dazzling
light of Dumbledore's sunlit office. The stone basin was shimmering in the cabinet
in front of him, and Albus Dumbledore was standing beside him.
"Professor," Harry gasped, "I know I shouldn't've - I didn't mean - the cabinet door
was sort of open and -"
"I quite understand," said Dumbledore. He lifted the basin, carried it over to his
desk, placed it upon the polished top, and sat down in the chair behind it. He
motioned for Harry to sit down opposite him.
Harry did so, staring at the stone basin. The contents had returned to their original,
silvery-white state, swirling and rippling beneath his gaze.
"What is it?" Harry asked shakily.
"This? It is called a Pensieve," said Dumbledore. "I sometimes find, and I am sure
you know the feeling, that I simply have too many thoughts and memories
crammed into my mind."
"Er," said Harry, who couldn't truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of the
sort.
"At these times," said Dumbledore, indicating the stone basin, "I use the Pensieve.
One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one's mind, pours them into the
basin, and examines them at one's leisure. It becomes easier to spot patterns and
links, you understand, when they are in this form."
"You mean . . . that stuff's your thoughts?" Harry said, staring at the swirling white
substance in the basin.
"Certainly," said Dumbledore. "Let me show you."
Dumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip into
his own silvery hair, near his temple. When he took the wand away, hair seemed to
be clinging to it - but then Harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the
same strange silvery-white substance that filled the Pensieve. Dumbledore added
this fresh thought to the basin, and Harry, astonished, saw his own face swimming
around the surface of the bowl. Dumbledore placed his long hands on either side
of the Pensieve and swirled it, rather as a gold prospector would pan for fragments
of gold.... and Harry saw his own face change smoothly into Snape's, who opened
his mouth and spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly.
"It's coming back . . . Karkaroff's too . . . stronger and clearer than ever..."
386"A connection I could have made without assistance," Dumbledore sighed, "but
never mind." He peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles at Harry, who
was gaping at Snape's face, which was continuing to swirl around the bowl. "I was
using the Pensieve when Mr. Fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather
hastily. Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door properly. Naturally, it would
have attracted your attention."
"I'm sorry," Harry mumbled.
Dumbledore shook his head. "Curiosity is not a sin," he said. "But we should
exercise caution with our curiosity. . . yes, indeed ..."
Frowning slightly, he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of his
wand. Instantly, a figure rose out of it, a plump, scowling girl of about sixteen,
who began to revolve slowly, with her feet still in the basin. She took no notice
whatsoever of Harry or Professor Dumbledore. When she spoke, her voice echoed
as Snape's had done, as though it were coming from the depths of the stone basin.
"He put a hex on me, Professor Dumbledore, and I
was only teasing him, sir, I only said I'd seen him kissing Florence behind the
greenhouses last Thursday. . . ."
"But why. Bertha," said Dumbledore sadly, looking up at the now silently
revolving girl, "why did you have to follow him in the first place?"
"Bertha?" Harry whispered, looking up at her. "Is that - was that Bertha Jorkins?"
"Yes," said Dumbledore, prodding the thoughts in the basin again; Bertha sank
back into them, and they became silvery and opaque once more. "That was Bertha
as I remember her at school."
The silvery light from the Pensieve illuminated Dumbledore's face, and it struck
Harry suddenly how very old he was looking. He knew, of course, that
Dumbledore was getting on in years, but somehow he never really thought of
Dumbledore as an old man.
"So, Harry," said Dumbledore quietly. "Before you got lost in my thoughts, you
wanted to tell me something."
"Yes," said Harry. "Professor - I was in Divination just now, and - er - I fell
asleep."
He hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was coming, but Dumbledore merely
said, "Quite understandable. Continue."
"Well, I had a dream," said Harry. "A dream about Lord Voldemort. He was
torturing Wormtail . . . you know who Wormtail-"
"I do know," said Dumbledore promptly. "Please continue."
387"Voldemort got a letter from an owl. He said something like, Wormtail's blunder
had been repaired. He said someone was dead. Then he said, Wormtail wouldn't be
fed to the snake - there was a snake beside his chair. He said - he said he'd be
feeding me to it,
instead. Then he did the Cruciatus Curse on Wormtail - and my scar hurt," Harry
said. "It woke me up, it hurt so badly."
Dumbledore merely looked at him.
"Er - that's all," said Harry.
"I see," said Dumbledore quietly. "I see. Now, has your scar hurt at any other time
this year, excepting the time it woke you up over the summer?"
"No, I - how did you know it woke me up over the summer?" said Harry,
astonished.
"You are not Sirius's only correspondent," said Dumbledore. "I have also been in
contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last year. It was I who suggested the
mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay."
Dumbledore got up and began walking up and down behind his desk. Every now
and then, he placed his wand tip to his temple, removed another shining silver
thought, and added it to the Pensieve. The thoughts inside began to swirl so fast
that Harry couldn't make out anything clearly: It was merely a blur of color.
"Professor?" he said quietly, after a couple of minutes.
Dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry.
"My apologies," he said quietly. He sat back down at his desk.
"D'you - d'you know why my scar's hurting me?"
Dumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a moment, and then said, "I have a
theory, no more than that. ... It is my belief that your scar hurts both when Lord
Voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of
hatred."
"But. . . why?"
"Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed," said Dumbledore.
"That is no ordinary scar."
"So you think . . . that dream . . . did it really happen?"
"It is possible," said Dumbledore. "I would say - probable. Harry - did you see
Voldemort?"
"No," said Harry. "Just the back of his chair. But - there wouldn't have been
388anything to see, would there? I mean, he hasn't got a body, has he? But. . . but then
how could he have held the wand?" Harry said slowly.
"How indeed?" muttered Dumbledore. "How indeed . . ."
Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while. Dumbledore was gazing across
the room, and, every now and then, placing his wand tip to his temple and adding
another shining silver thought to the seething mass within the Pensieve.
"Professor," Harry said at last, "do you think he's getting stronger?"
"Voldemort?" said Dumbledore, looking at Harry over the Pensieve. It was the
characteristic, piercing look Dumbledore had given him on other occasions, and
always made Harry feel as though Dumbledore were seeing right through him in a
way that even Moody's magical eye could not. "Once again. Harry, I can only give
you my suspicions."
Dumbledore sighed again, and he looked older, and wearier, than ever.
"The years of Voldemort's ascent to power," he said, "were marked with
disappearances. Bertha Jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where
Voldemort was certainly known to be last. Mr. Crouch too has disappeared . . .
within these very grounds. And there was a third disappearance, one which the
Ministry, I regret to say, do not consider of any importance, for it concerns a
Muggle. His name was Frank Bryce, he lived in the village where Voldemort's
father grew up, and he has not been seen since last August. You see, I read the
Muggle newspapers, unlike most of my Ministry friends."
Dumbledore looked very seriously at Harry.
"These disappearances seem to me to be linked. The Ministry disagrees - as you
may have heard, while waiting outside my office."
Harry nodded. Silence fell between them again, Dumbledore extracting thoughts
every now and then. Harry felt as though he ought to go, but his curiosity held him
in his chair.
"Professor?" he said again.
"Yes, Harry?" said Dumbledore.
"Er . . . could I ask you about. . . that court thing I was in ... in the Pensieve?"
"You could," said Dumbledore heavily. "I attended it many times, but some trials
come back to me more clearly than others ... particularly now. ..."
"You know - you know the trial you found me in? The one with Crouch's son?
Well....were they talking about Neville's parents?"
Dumbledore gave Harry a very sharp look. " Has Neville never told you why he
has been brought up by his grandmother?" he said.
389Harry shook his head, wondering, as he did so, how he could have failed to ask
Neville this, in almost four years of knowing him.
"Yes, they were talking about Nevilles parents," said Dumbledore. "His father,
Frank, was an Auror just like Professor Moody. He and his wife were tortured for
information about Voldemort's whereabouts after he lost his powers, as you
heard."
"So they're dead?" said Harry quietly.
"No," said Dumbledore, his voice full of a bitterness Harry had never heard there
before. "They are insane. They are both in St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical
Maladies and Injuries. I believe Neville visits them, with his grandmother, during
the holidays. They do not recognize him."
Harry sat there, horror-struck. He had never known . . . never, in four years,
bothered to find out. . .
"The Longbottoms were very popular," said Dumbledore. "The attacks on them
came after Voldemort's fall from power, just when everyone thought they were
safe. Those attacks caused a wave of fury such as I have never known. The
Ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it. Unfortunately,
the Longbottoms' evidence was - given their condition - none too reliable."
"Then Mr. Crouch's son might not have been involved?" said Harry slowly.
Dumbledore shook his head.
"As to that, I have no idea."
Harry sat in silence once more, watching the contents of the Pensieve swirl. There
were two more questions he was burning to ask . . . but they concerned the guilt of
living people. . . .
"Er," he said, "Mr. Bagman . .."
"... has never been accused of any Dark activity since," said Dumbledore calmly.
"Right," said Harry hastily, staring at the contents of the Pensieve again, which
were swirling more slowly now that Dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts.
"And ... er ..."
But the Pensieve seemed to be asking his question for him.
Snape's face was swimming on the surface again. Dumbledore glanced down into
it, and then up at Harry.
"No more has Professor Snape," he said.
Harry looked into Dumbledore's light blue eyes, and the thing he really wanted to
know spilled out of his mouth before he could stop it.
390"What made you think he'd really stopped supporting Voldemort, Professor?"
Dumbledore held Harrys gaze for a few seconds, and then said, "That, Harry, is a
matter between Professor Snape and myself."
Harry knew that the interview was over; Dumbledore did not look angry, yet there
was a finality in his tone that told Harry it was time to go. He stood up, and so did
Dumbledore.
"Harry," he said as Harry reached the door. "Please do not speak about Neville's
parents to anybody else. He has the right to let people know, when he is ready."
"Yes, Professor," said Harry, turning to go.
"And-"
Harry looked back. Dumbledore was standing over the Pensieve, his face lit from
beneath by its silvery spots of light, looking older than ever. He stared at Harry for
a moment, and then said, "Good luck with the third task."
391CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE - THE THIRD TASK
Dumbledore reckons You-Know-Who's getting stronger again as well?" Ron
whispered.
Everything Harry had seen in the Pensieve, nearly everything Dumbledore had
told and shown him afterward, he had now shared with Ron and Hermione - and,
of course, with Sirius, to whom Harry had sent an owl the moment he had left
Dumbledore's office. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat up late in the common room
once again that night, talking it all over until Harry's mind was reeling, until he
understood what Dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of
thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off.
Ron stared into the common room fire. Harry thought he saw Ron shiver slightly,
even though the evening was warm.
"And he trusts Snape?" Ron said. "He really trusts Snape, even though he knows
he was a Death Eater?"
"Yes," said Harry.
Hermione had not spoken for ten minutes. She was sitting with her forehead in her
hands, staring at her knees. Harry thought she too looked as though she could have
done with a Pensieve.
"Rita Skeeter," she muttered finally.
"How can you be worrying about her now?" said Ron, in utter disbelief.
"I'm not worrying about her," Hermione said to her knees. "I'm just thinking. . .
remember what she said to me in the Three Broomsticks? 'I know things about
Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl. ' This is what she meant, isn't it?
She reported his trial, she knew he'd passed information to the Death Eaters. And
Winky too, remember . . .'Ludo Bagman's a bad wizard.' Mr. Crouch would have
been furious he got off, he would have talked about it at home."
"Yeah, but Bagman didn't pass information on purpose, did he?"
Hermione shrugged.
"And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked Crouch?" Ron said, turning back
to Harry.
"Yeah," said Harry, "but he's only saying that because Crouch disappeared near
the Beauxbatons carriage."
"We never thought of her, did we?" said Ron slowly. "Mind you, she's definitely
got giant blood, and she doesn't want to admit it-"
392"Of course she doesn't," said Hermione sharply, looking up. "Look what happened
to Hagrid when Rita found out about his mother. Look at Fudge, jumping to
conclusions about her, just because she's part giant. Who needs that sort of
prejudice? I'd probably say I had big bones if I knew that's what I'd get for telling
the truth."
Hermione looked at her watch. "We haven't done any practicing!" she said,
looking shocked. "We were going to do the Impediment Curse! We'll have to
really get down to it tomorrow! Come on. Harry, you need to get some sleep."
Harry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory. As Harry pulled on his
pajamas, he looked over at Nevilles bed. True to his word to Dumbledore, he had
not told Ron and Hermione about Neville s parents. As Harry took off his glasses
and climbed into his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel to have parents still
living but unable to recognize you. He often got sympathy from strangers for
being an orphan, but as he listened to Nevilles snores, he thought that Neville
deserved it more than he did. Lying in the darkness, Harry felt a rush of anger and
hate toward the people who had tortured Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom. ... He
remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch's son and his companions had been
dragged from the court by the dementors. ... He understood how they had felt. . . .
Then he remembered the milk-white face of the screaming boy and realized with a
jolt that he had died a year later. . . .
It was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up at the canopy of his bed in the
darkness, it all came back to Voldemort. ... He was the one who had torn these
families apart, who had ruined all these lives. . . .
Ron and Hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams, which would
finish on the day of the third task, but they were putting most of their efforts into
helping Harry prepare.
"Don't worry about it," Hermione said shortly when Harry pointed this out to them
and said he didn't mind practicing on his own for a while, "at least we'll get top
marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts. We'd never have found out about all
these hexes in class."
"Good training for when we're all Aurors," said Ron excitedly, attempting the
Impediment Curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop
dead in midair.
The mood in the castle as they entered June became excited and tense again.
Everyone was looking forward to the third task, which would take place a week
before the end of term. Harry was practicing hexes at every available moment. He
felt more confident about this task than either of the others. Difficult and
dangerous though it would undoubtedly be, Moody was right: Harry had managed
to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now, and
this time he had some notice, some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead.
393Tired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all over the school. Professor
McGonagall had given them permission to use the empty Transfiguration
classroom at lunchtimes. Harry had soon mastered the Impediment Curse, a spell
to slow down and obstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would enable him
to blast solid objects out of his way; and the Four-Point Spell, a useful discovery
of Hermiones that would make his wand point due north, therefore enabling him to
check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze. He was still
having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a
temporary, invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione
managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx, and Harry wobbled
around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counter-
jinx.
"You're still doing really well, though," Hermione said encouragingly, looking
down her list and crossing off those spells they had already learned. "Some of
these are bound to come in handy."
"Come and look at this," said Ron, who was standing by the window. He was
staring down onto the grounds. "What's Malfoy doing?"
Harry and Hermione went to see. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in the
shadow of a tree below. Crabbe and Goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout; both
were smirking. Malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it.
"He looks like he's using a walkie-talkie," said Harry curiously.
"He can't be," said Hermione, "I've told you, those sorts of things don't work
around Hogwarts. Come on, Harry," she added briskly, turning away from the
window and moving back into the middle of the room, "let's try that Shield Charm
again."
Sirius was sending daily owls now. Like Hermione, he seemed to want to
concentrate on getting Harry through the last task before they concerned
themselves with anything else. He reminded Harry in every letter that whatever
might be going on outside the walls of Hogwarts was not Harry's responsibility,
nor was it within his power to influence it.
If Voldemort is really getting stronger again, he wrote, my priority is to ensure
your safety. He cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under
Dumbledore's protection, but all the same, take no risks: Concentrate on getting
through that maze safely, and then we can turn our attention to other matters.
Harry's nerves mounted as June the twenty-fourth drew closer, but they were not
as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks. For one thing, he was
confident that, this time, he had done everything in his power to prepare for the
task. For another, this was the final hurdle, and however well or badly he did, the
tournament would at last be over, which would be an enormous relief.
Breakfast was a very noisy affair at the Gryffindor table on the morning of the
394third task. The post owls appeared, bringing Harry a good-luck card from Sirius. It
was only a piece of parchment, folded over and bearing a muddy paw print on its
front, but Harry appreciated it all the same. A screech owl arrived for Hermione,
carrying her morning copy of the Daily Prophet as usual. She unfolded the paper,
glanced at the front page, and spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it.
"What?" said Harry and Ron together, staring at her. "Nothing," said Hermione
quickly, trying to shove the paper out of sight, but Ron grabbed it. He stared at the
headline and said, "No way. Not today. That old cow."
"What?" said Harry. "Rita Skeeter again?"
"No," said Ron, and just like Hermione, he attempted to push the paper out of
sight.
"It's about me, isn't it?" said Harry.
"No," said Ron, in an entirely unconvincing tone. But before Harry could demand
to see the paper. Draco Malfoy shouted across the Great Hall from the Slytherin
table.
"Hey, Potter! Potter! How's your head? You feeling all right? Sure you're not
going to go berserk on us?"
Malfoy was holding a copy of the Daily Prophet too. Slytherins up and down the
table were sniggering, twisting in their seats to see Harry's reaction.
"Let me see it," Harry said to Ron. "Give it here."
Very reluctantly, Ron handed over the newspaper. Harry turned it over and found
himself staring at his own picture, beneath the banner headline:
"HARRY POTTER "DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS"
The boy who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is unstable and possibly
dangerous, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. Alarming evidence has
recently come to light about Harry Potter's strange behavior, which casts doubts
upon his suitability to compete in a demanding competition like the Triwizard
Tournament, or even to attend Hogwarts School.
Potter, the Daily Prophet can exclusively reveal, regularly collapses at school, and
is often heard to complain of pain in the scar on his forehead (relic of the curse
with which You-Know-Who attempted to kill him). On Monday last, midway
through a Divination lesson, your Daily Prophet reporter witnessed Potter
storming from the class, claiming that his scar was hurting too badly to continue
studying.
It is possible, say top experts at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and
Injuries, that Potters brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by You-
Know-Who, and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of
395his deep-seated confusion.
"He might even be pretending," said one specialist. "This could be a plea for
attention."
The Daily Prophet, however, has unearthed worrying facts about Harry Potter that
Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, has carefully concealed from the
wizarding public.
"Potter can speak Parseltongue," reveals Draco Malfoy, a Hogwarts fourth year.
"There were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago, and most people
thought Potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling
club and set a snake on another boy. It was all hushed up, though. But he's made
friends with werewolves and giants too. We think he'd do anything for a bit of
power."
Parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been considered a Dark
Art. Indeed, the most famous Parselmouth of our times is none other than You-
Know-Who himself. A member of the Dark Force Defense League, who wished to
remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak
Parseltongue "as worthy of investigation. Personally, I would be highly suspicious
of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often used in the
worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are historically associated with evildoers."
Similarly, "anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as
werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence."
Albus Dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be
allowed to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. Some fear that Potter might
resort to the Dark Arts in his desperation to win the tournament, the third task of
which takes place this evening.
"Gone off me a bit, hasn't she?" said Harry lightly, folding up the paper.
Over at the Slytherin table, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were laughing at him,
tapping their heads with their fingers, pulling grotesquely mad faces, and waggling
their tongues like snakes.
"How did she know your scar hurt in Divination?" Ron said. "There's no way she
was there, there's no way she could've heard -"
"The window was open," said Harry. "I opened it to breathe."
"You were at the top of North Tower!" Hermione said. "Your voice couldn't have
carried all the way down to the grounds!"
"Well, you're the one who's supposed to be researching magical methods of
bugging!" said Harry. "You tell me how she did it!"
"I've been trying!" said Hermione. "But I... but. . ."
396An odd, dreamy expression suddenly came over Hermione's face. She slowly
raised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair.
"Are you all right?" said Ron, frowning at her.
"Yes," said Hermione breathlessly. She ran her fingers through her hair again, and
then held her hand up to her mouth, as though speaking into an invisible walkie-
talkie. Harry and Ron stared at each other.
"I've had an idea," Hermione said, gazing into space. "I think I know. . . because
then no one would be able to see ... even Moody. . . and she'd have been able to
get onto the window ledge . . . but she's not allowed . . . she's definitely not
allowed ... I think we've got her! Just give me two seconds in the library - just to
make sure!"
With that, Hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the Great Hall.
"Oi!" Ron called after her. "We've got our History of Magic exam in ten minutes!
Blimey," he said, turning back to Harry, "she must really hate that Skeeter woman
to risk missing the start of an exam. What're you going to do in Binns's class - read
again?"
Exempt from the end-of-term tests as a Triwizard champion, Harry had been
sitting in the back of every exam class so far, looking up fresh hexes for the third
task.
"S'pose so," Harry said to Ron; but just then. Professor McGonagall came walking
alongside the Gryffindor table toward him.
"Potter, the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after
breakfast," she said.
"But the task's not till tonight!" said Harry, accidentally spilling scrambled eggs
down his front, afraid he had mistaken the time.
"I'm aware of that, Potter," she said. "The champions' families are invited to watch
the final task, you know. This is simply a chance for you to greet them."
She moved away. Harry gaped after her.
"She doesn't expect the Dursleys to turn up, does she?" he asked Ron blankly.
"Dunno," said Ron. "Harry, I'd better hurry, I'm going to be late for Binns. See you
later."
Harry finished his breakfast in the emptying Great Hall. He saw Fleur Delacour
get up from the Ravenclaw table and join Cedric as he crossed to the side chamber
and entered. Krum slouched off to join them shortly afterward. Harry stayed where
he was. He really didn't want to go into the chamber. He had no family - no family
who would turn up to see him risk his life, anyway. But just as he was getting up,
397thinking that he might as well go up to the library and do a spot more hex research,
the door of the side chamber opened, and Cedric stuck his head out.
"Harry, come on, they're waiting for you!"
Utterly perplexed. Harry got up. The Dursleys couldn't possibly be here, could
they? He walked across the Hall and opened the door into the chamber.
Cedric and his parents were just inside the door. Viktor Krum was over in a
corner, conversing with his dark-haired mother and father in rapid Bulgarian. He
had inherited his fathers hooked nose. On the other side of the room, Fleur was
jabbering away in French to her mother. Fleur's little sister, Gabrielle, was holding
her mother's hand. She waved at Harry, who waved back, grinning. Then he saw
Mrs. Weasley and Bill standing in front of the fireplace, beaming at him.
"Surprise!" Mrs. Weasley said excitedly as he smiled broadly and walked over to
them. "Thought we'd come and watch you. Harry!" She bent down and kissed him
on the cheek.
"You all right?" said Bill, grinning at Harry and shaking his hand. "Charlie wanted
to come, but he couldn't get time off. He said you were incredible against the
Horntail."
Fleur Delacour, Harry noticed, was eyeing Bill with great interest over her
mother's shoulder. Harry could tell she had no objection whatsoever to long hair or
earrings with fangs on them.
"This is really nice of you," Harry muttered to Mrs. Weasley. "I thought for a
moment - the Dursleys -"
"Hmm," said Mrs. Weasley, pursing her lips. She had always refrained from
criticizing the Dursleys in front of Harry, but her eyes flashed every time they
were mentioned.
"It's great being back here," said Bill, looking around the chamber (Violet, the Fat
Lady's friend, winked at him from her frame). "Haven't seen this place for five
years. Is that picture of the mad knight still around? Sir Cadogan?"
"Oh yeah," said Harry, who had met Sir Cadogan the previous year.
"And the Fat Lady?" said Bill.
"She was here in my time," said Mrs. Weasley. "She gave me such a telling off
one night when I got back to the dormitory at four in the morning -"
"What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning?" said Bill,
surveying his mother with amazement.
Mrs. Weasley grinned, her eyes twinkling.
"Your father and I had been for a nighttime stroll," she said. "He got caught by
398Apollyon Pringle - he was the caretaker in those days - your father's still got the
marks."
"Fancy giving us a tour, Harry?" said Bill.
"Yeah, okay," said Harry, and they made their way back toward the door into the
Great Hall. As they passed Amos Diggory, he looked around.
"There you are, are you?" he said, looking Harry up and down.
"Bet you're not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedrics caught you up on
points, are you?"
"What?" said Harry.
"Ignore him," said Cedric in a low voice to Harry, frowning after his father. "He's
been angry ever since Rita Skeeters article about the Triwizard Tournament - you
know, when she made out you were the only Hogwarts champion."
"Didn't bother to correct her, though, did he?" said Amos Diggory, loudly enough
for Harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with Mrs. Weasley and Bill.
"Still, . . you'll show him, Ced. Beaten him once before, haven't you?"
"Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble, Amos!" Mrs. Weasley said
angrily. "I would have thought you'd know that, working at the Ministry!"
Mr. Diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry, but his wife
laid a hand on his arm, and he merely shrugged and turned away.
Harry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with Bill and
Mrs. Weasley, showing them the Beauxbatons carriage and the Durmstrang ship.
Mrs. Weasley was intrigued by the Whomping Willow, which had been planted
after she had left school, and reminisced at length about the gamekeeper before
Hagrid, a man called Ogg.
"How's Percy?" Harry asked as they walked around the greenhouses.
"Not good," said Bill.
"He's very upset," said Mrs. Weasley, lowering her voice and glancing around.
"The Ministry wants to keep Mr. Crouch's disappearance quiet, but Percy's been
hauled in for questioning about the instructions Mr. Crouch has been sending in.
They seem to think there's a chance they weren't genuinely written by him. Percy's
been under a lot of strain. They're not letting him fill in for Mr. Crouch as the fifth
judge tonight. Cornelius Fudge is going to be doing it."
They returned to the castle for lunch.
"Mum - Bill!" said Ron, looking stunned, as he joined the Gryffindor table.
"What're you doing here?"
399"Come to watch Harry in the last task!" said Mrs. Weasley brightly. "I must say, it
makes a lovely change, not having to cook. How was your exam?"
"Oh . . . okay," said Ron. "Couldn't remember all the goblin rebels' names, so I
invented a few. It's all right," he said, helping himself to a Cornish pasty, while
Mrs. Weasley looked stern, "they're all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and
Urg the Unclean; it wasn't hard."
Fred, George, and Ginny came to sit next to them too, and Harry was having such
a good time he felt almost as though he were back at the Burrow; he had forgotten
to worry about that evening's task, and not until Hermione turned up, halfway
through lunch, did he remember that she had had a brainwave about Rita Skeeter.
"Are you going to tell us - ?"
Hermione shook her head warningly and glanced at Mrs. Weasley.
"Hello, Hermione," said Mrs. Weasley, much more stiffly than usual.
"Hello," said Hermione, her smile faltering at the cold expression on Mrs.
Weasley's face.
Harry looked between them, then said, "Mrs. Weasley, you didn't believe that
rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in Witch Weekly, did you? Because Hermione's not my
girlfriend."
"Oh!" said Mrs. Weasley "No - of course I didn't!"
But she became considerably warmer toward Hermione after that.
Harry, Bill, and Mrs. Weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk around
the castle, and then returned to the Great Hall for the evening feast. Ludo Bagman
and Cornelius Fudge had joined the staff table now. Bagman looked quite
cheerful, but Cornelius Fudge, who was sitting next to Madame Maxime, looked
stern and was not talking. Madame Maxime was concentrating on her plate, and
Harry thought her eyes looked red. Hagrid kept glancing along the table at her,
There were more courses than usual, but Harry, who was starting to feel really
nervous now, didn't eat much. As the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade
from blue to a dusky purple, Dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff table, and
silence fell.
"Ladies and gentlemen, in five minutes' time, I will be asking you to make your
way down to the Quidditch field for the third and final task of the Triwizard
Tournament. Will the champions please follow Mr. Bagman down to the stadium
now."
Harry got up. The Gryffindors all along the table were applauding him; the
Weasleys and Hermione all wished him good luck, and he headed off out of the
Great Hall with Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor.
400"Feeling all right. Harry?" Bagman asked as they went down the stone steps onto
the grounds. "Confident?"
"I'm okay," said Harry. It was sort of true; he was nervous, but he kept running
over all the hexes and spells he had been practicing in his mind as they walked,
and the knowledge that he could remember them all made him feel better.
They walked onto the Quidditch field, which was now completely unrecognizable.
A twenty-foot-high hedge ran all the way around the edge of it. There was a gap
right in front of them: the entrance to the vast maze. The passage beyond it looked
dark and creepy.
Five minutes later, the stands had begun to fill; the air was full of excited voices
and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats. The sky
was a deep, clear blue now, and the first stars were starting to appear. Hagrid,
Professor Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Flitwick came walking
into the stadium and approached Bagman and the champions. They were wearing
large, red, luminous stars on their hats, all except Hagrid, who had his on the back
of his moleskin vest.
"We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze," said Professor
McGonagall to the champions. "If you get into difficulty, and wish to be rescued,
send red sparks into the air, and one of us will come and get you, do you
understand?"
The champions nodded.
"Off you go, then!" said Bagman brightly to the four patrollers.
"Good luck. Harry," Hagrid whispered, and the four of them walked away in
different directions, to station themselves around the maze. Bagman now pointed
his wand at his throat, muttered, "Sonorus," and his magically magnified voice
echoed into the stands.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is
about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently stand! Tied in first
place, with eighty-five points each - Mr. Cedric Diggory and Mr. Harry Potter,
both of Hogwarts School!" The cheers and applause sent birds from the Forbidden
Forest fluttering into the darkening sky. "In second place, with eighty points - Mr.
Viktor Krum, of Durmstrang Institute!" More applause. "And in third place - Miss
Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons Academy!"
Harry could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione applauding
Fleur politely, halfway up the stands. He waved up at them, and they waved back,
beaming at him.
"So ... on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!" said Bagman. "Three - two - one -"
He gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forward into the
401maze.
The towering hedges cast black shadows across the path, and, whether because
they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted, the sound of the
surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze. Harry felt
almost as though he were underwater again. He pulled out his wand, muttered,
"Lumos," and heard Cedric do the same just behind him.
After about fifty yards, they reached a fork. They looked at each other.
"See you," Harry said, and he took the left one, while Cedric took the right.
Harry heard Bagman's whistle for the second time. Krum had entered the maze.
Harry sped up. His chosen path seemed completely deserted. He turned right, and
hurried on, holding his wand high over his head, trying to see as far ahead as
possible. Still, there was nothing in sight.
Bagman's whistle blew in the distance for the third time. All of the champions
were now inside.
Harry kept looking behind him. The old feeling that he was being watched was
upon him. The maze was growing darker with every passing minute as the sky
overhead deepened to navy. He reached a second fork.
"Point Me," he whispered to his wand, holding it flat in his palm.
The wand spun around once and pointed toward his right, into solid hedge. That
way was north, and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the center of the
maze. The best he could do was to take the left fork and go right again as soon as
possible.
The path ahead was empty too, and when Harry reached a right turn and took it, he
again found his way unblocked. Harry didn't know why, but the lack of obstacles
was unnerving him. Surely he should have met something by now? It felt as
though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security. Then he heard
movement right behind him. He held out his wand, ready to attack, but its beam
fell only upon Cedric, who had just hurried out of a path on the right-hand side.
Cedric looked severely shaken. The sleeve of his robe was smoking.
"Hagrid's Blast-Ended Skrewts!" he hissed. "They're enormous - I only just got
away!"
He shook his head and dived out of sight, along another path. Keen to put plenty
of distance between himself and the skrewts, Harry hurried off again. Then, as he
turned a corner, he saw ... a dementor gliding toward him. Twelve feet tall, its face
hidden by its hood, its rotting, scabbed hands outstretched, it advanced, sensing its
way blindly toward him. Harry could hear its rattling breath; he felt clammy
coldness stealing over him, but knew what he had to do....
He summoned the happiest thought he could, concentrated with all his might on
402the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with Ron and Hermione,
raised his wand, and cried, "Expecto Patronum!"
A silver stag erupted from the end of Harry's wand and galloped toward the
dementor, which fell back and tripped over the hem of its robes. . . . Harry had
never seen a dementor stumble.
"Hang on!" he shouted, advancing in the wake of his silver Patronus, "You're a
boggart! Riddikulus!"
There was a loud crack, and the shape-shifter exploded in a wisp of smoke. The
silver stag faded from sight. Harry wished it could have stayed, he could have used
some company...but he moved on, quickly and quietly as possible, listening hard,
his wand held high once more.
Left ... right... left again . . . Twice he found himself facing dead ends. He did the
Four-Point Spell again and found that he was going too far east. He turned back,
took a right turn, and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of him.
Harry approached it cautiously, pointing the wand's beam at it. This looked like
some kind of enchantment. He wondered whether he might be able to blast it out
of the way.
"Reducio!" he said.
The spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it intact. He supposed he should
have known better; the Reductor Curse was for solid objects. What would happen
if he walked through the mist? Was it worth chancing it, or should he double
back?
He was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence.
"Fleur?" Harry yelled.
There was silence. He stared all around him. What had happened to her? Her
scream seemed to have come from somewhere ahead. He took a deep breath and
ran through the enchanted mist.
The world turned upside down. Harry was hanging from the ground, with his hair
on end, his glasses dangling off his nose, threatening to fall into the bottomless
sky. He clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there, terrified. It felt as
though his feet were glued to the grass, which had now become the ceiling. Below
him the dark, star-spangled heavens stretched endlessly. He felt as though if he
tried to move one of his feet, he would fall away from the earth completely.
Think, he told himself, as all the blood rushed to his head, think. . .
But not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed to combat a sudden
reversal of ground and sky. Did he dare move his foot? He could hear the blood
pounding in his ears. He had two choices - try and move, or send up red sparks,
403and get rescued and disqualified from the task.
He shut his eyes, so he wouldn't be able to see the view of endless space below
him, and pulled his right foot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceiling.
Immediately, the world righted itself. Harry fell forward onto his knees onto the
wonderfully solid ground. He felt temporarily limp with shock. He took a deep,
steadying breath, then got up again and hurried forward, looking back over his
shoulder as he ran away from the golden mist, which twinkled innocently at him in
the moonlight.
He paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for some sign of Fleur. He
was sure it had been she who had screamed. What had she met? Was she all right?
There was no sign of red sparks - did that mean she had got herself out of trouble,
or was she in such trouble that she couldn't reach her wand? Harry took the right
fork with a feeling of increasing unease . . . but at the same time, he couldn't help
thinking. One champion down. . .
The cup was somewhere close by, and it sounded as though Fleur was no longer in
the running. He'd got this far, hadn't he? What if he actually managed to win?
Fleetingly, and for the first time since he'd found himself champion, he saw again
that image of himself, raising the Triwizard Cup in front of the rest of the school. .
..
He met nothing for ten minutes, but kept running into dead ends. Twice he took
the same wrong turning. Finally, he found a new route and started to jog along it,
his wandlight waving, making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge walls.
Then he rounded another corner and found himself facing a Blast-Ended Skrewt.
Cedric was right - it was enormous. Ten feet long, it looked more like a giant
scorpion than anything. Its long sting was curled over its back. Its thick armor
glinted in the light from Harry's wand, which he pointed at it.
"Stupefy!"
The spell hit the skrewt's armor and rebounded; Harry ducked just in time, but
could smell burning hair; it had singed the top of his head. The skrewt issued a
blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him.
"Impedimenta!" Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt's armor again and
ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over.
"IMPEDIMENTA!"
The skrewt was inches from him when it froze - he had managed to hit it on its
fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it and ran,
hard, in the opposite direction - the Impediment Curse was not permanent; the
skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.
He took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another; forcing himself to
404stop, heart hammering, he performed the Four-Point Spell again, backtracked, and
chose a path that would take him northwest.
He had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes, when he heard
something in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop dead.
"What are you doing?" yelled Cedric's voice. "What the hell d'you think you're
doing?"
And then Harry heard Krum's voice.
"Crucio!"
The air was suddenly full of Cedric's yells. Horrified, Harry began sprinting up his
path, trying to find a way into Cedric's. When none appeared, he tried the
Reductor Curse again. It wasn't very effective, but it burned a small hole in the
hedge through which Harry forced his leg, kicking at the thick brambles and
branches until they broke and made an opening; he struggled through it, tearing his
robes, and looking to his right, saw Cedric jerking and twitching on the ground,
Krum standing over him.
Harry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at Krum just as Krum looked up.
Krum turned and began to run.
"Stupefy!" Harry yelled.
The spell hit Krum in the back; he stopped dead in his tracks, fell forward, and lay
motionless, facedown in the grass. Harry-dashed over to Cedric, who had stopped
twitching and was lying there panting, his hands over his face.
"Are you all right?" Harry said roughly, grabbing Cedric's arm.
"Yeah," panted Cedric. "Yeah ... I don't believe it... he crept up behind me. ... I
heard him, I turned around, and he had his wand on me. . . ."
Cedric got up. He was still shaking. He and Harry looked down at Krum.
"I can't believe this ... I thought he was all right," Harry said, staring at Krum.
"So did I," said Cedric.
"Did you hear Fleur scream earlier?" said Harry.
"Yeah," said Cedric. "You don't think Krum got her too?"
"I don't know," said Harry slowly.
"Should we leave him here?" Cedric muttered.
"No," said Harry. "I reckon we should send up red sparks. Someone'll come and
collect him . . . otherwise he'll probably be eaten by a skrewt."
405"He'd deserve it," Cedric muttered, but all the same, he raised his wand and shot a
shower of red sparks into the air, which hovered high above Krum, marking the
spot where he lay.
Harry and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment, looking around them.
Then Cedric said, "Well... I s'pose we'd better go on. . . ."
"What?" said Harry. "Oh . . . yeah . . . right. . ."
It was an odd moment. He and Cedric had been briefly united against Krum - now
the fact that they were opponents came back to Harry. The two of them proceeded
up the dark path without speaking, then Harry turned left, and Cedric right.
Cedric's footsteps soon died away.
Harry moved on, continuing to use the Four-Point Spell, making sure he was
moving in the right direction. It was between him and Cedric now. His desire to
reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever, but he could hardly believe
what he'd just seen Krum do. The use of an Unforgivable Curse on a fellow human
being meant a life term in Azkaban, that was what Moody had told them. Krum
surely couldn't have wanted the Triwizard Cup that badly....Harry sped up.
Every so often he hit more dead ends, but the increasing darkness made him feel
sure he was getting near the heart of the maze. Then, as he strode down a long,
straight path, he saw movement once again, and his beam of wandlight hit an
extraordinary creature, one which he had only seen in picture form, in his Monster
Book of Monsters.
It was a sphinx. It had the body of an over-large lion: great clawed paws and a
long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a woman.
She turned her long, almond-shaped eyes upon Harry as he approached. He raised
his wand, hesitating. She was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing from side to
side of the path, blocking his progress. Then she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice.
"You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me."
"So ... so will you move, please?" said Harry, knowing what the answer was going
to be.
"No," she said, continuing to pace. "Not unless you can answer my riddle. Answer
on your first guess - I let you pass. Answer wrongly - I attack. Remain silent - I
will let you walk away from me unscathed."
Harry's stomach slipped several notches. It was Hermione who was good at this
sort of thing, not him. He weighed his chances. If the riddle was too hard, he could
keep silent, get away from the sphinx unharmed, and try and find an alternative
route to the center.
"Okay," he said. "Can I hear the riddle?"
The sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very middle of the path, and
406recited:
"First think of the person who lives in disguise,
Who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.
Next, tell me what's always the last thing to mend,
The middle of middle and end of the end?
And finally give me the sound often heard
During the search for a hard-to-find word.
Now string them together, and answer me this,
Which creature would you be unwilling to kiss?"
Harry gaped at her.
"Could I have it again . . . more slowly?" he asked tentatively. She blinked at him,
smiled, and repeated the poem. "All the clues add up to a creature I wouldn't want
to kiss?" Harry asked.
She merely smiled her mysterious smile. Harry took that for a "yes." Harry cast his
mind around. There were plenty of animals he wouldn't want to kiss; his
immediate thought was a Blast-Ended Skrewt, but something told him that wasn't
the answer. He'd have to try and work out the clues. . . .
"A person in disguise," Harry muttered, staring at her, "who lies ... er ... that'd be a
- an impostor. No, that's not my guess! A - a spy? I'll come back to that. . . could
you give me the next clue again, please?"
She repeated the next lines of the poem.
"'The last thing to mend,'" Harry repeated. "Er ... no idea . . . 'middle of middle' . . .
could I have the last bit again?"
She gave him the last four lines.
"'The sound often heard during the search for a hard-to-find word,'" said Harry.
"Er . . . that'd be ... er ... hang on - 'er'! Er's a sound!"
The sphinx smiled at him.
"Spy ... er ... spy ... er ..." said Harry, pacing up and down. "A creature I wouldn't
want to kiss . . . a spider!"
The sphinx smiled more broadly. She got up, stretched her front legs, and then
moved aside for him to pass.
"Thanks!" said Harry, and, amazed at his own brilliance, he dashed forward.
407He had to be close now, he had to be. ... His wand was telling him he was bang on
course; as long as he didn't meet anything too horrible, he might have a chance. . .
.
Harry broke into a run. He had a choice of paths up ahead. "Point Me!" he
whispered again to his wand, and it spun around and pointed him to the right-hand
one. He dashed up this one and saw light ahead.
The Triwizard Cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away. Suddenly a
dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of him.
Cedric was going to get there first. Cedric was sprinting as fast as he could toward
the cup, and Harry knew he would never catch up, Cedric was much taller, had
much longer legs -
Then Harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left, moving quickly
along a path that intersected with his own; it was moving so fast Cedric was about
to run into it, and Cedric, his eyes on the cup, had not seen it -
"Cedric!" Harry bellowed. "On your left!"
Cedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing and avoid colliding
with it, but in his haste, he tripped. Harry saw Cedric's wand fly out of his hand as
a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon Cedric.
"Stupefy!" Harry yelled; the spell hit the spider's gigantic, hairy black body, but
for all the good it did, he might as well have thrown a stone at it; the spider jerked,
scuttled around, and ran at Harry instead.
"Stupefy! Impedimenta! Stupefy!"
But it was no use - the spider was either so large, or so magical, that the spells
were doing no more than aggravating it. Harry had one horrifying glimpse of eight
shining black eyes and razor-sharp pincers before it was upon him.
He was lifted into the air in its front legs; struggling madly, he tried to kick it; his
leg connected with the pincers and next moment he was in excruciating pain. He
could hear Cedric yelling "Stupefy!" too, but his spell had no more effect than
Harry's - Harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and
shouted "Expelliarmus!"
It worked - the Disarming Spell made the spider drop him, but that meant that
Harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg, which crumpled beneath him.
Without pausing to think, he aimed high at the spider's underbelly, as he had done
with the skrewt, and shouted "Stupefy!''just as Cedric yelled the same thing.
The two spells combined did what one alone had not: The spider keeled over
sideways, flattening a nearby hedge, and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy
legs.
408"Harry!" he heard Cedric shouting. "You all right? Did it fall on you?"
"No," Harry called back, panting. He looked down at his leg. It was bleeding
freely. He could see some sort of thick, gluey secretion from the spider's pincers
on his torn robes. He tried to get up, but his leg was shaking badly and did not
want to support his weight. He leaned against the hedge, gasping for breath, and
looked around.
Cedric was standing feet from the Triwizard Cup, which was gleaming behind
him.
"Take it, then," Harry panted to Cedric. "Go on, take it. You're there."
But Cedric didn't move. He merely stood there, looking at Harry. Then he turned
to stare at the cup. Harry saw the longing expression on his face in its golden light.
Cedric looked around at Harry again, who was now holding onto the hedge to
support himself. Cedric took a deep breath.
"You take it. You should win. That's twice you've saved my neck in here."
"That's not how it's supposed to work," Harry said. He felt angry; his leg was very
painful, he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider, and after all his
efforts, Cedric had beaten him to it, just as he'd beaten Harry to ask Cho to the
ball. "The one who reaches the cup first gets the points. That's you. I'm telling you,
I'm not going to win any races on this leg."
Cedric took a few paces nearer to the Stunned spider, away from the cup, shaking
his head.
"No," he said.
"Stop being noble," said Harry irritably. "Just take it, then we can get out of here."
Cedric watched Harry steadying himself, holding tight to the hedge.
"You told me about the dragons," Cedric said. "I would've gone down in the first
task if you hadn't told me what was coming."
"I had help on that too," Harry snapped, trying to mop up his bloody leg with his
robes. "You helped me with the egg - we're square."
"I had help on the egg in the first place," said Cedric.
"We're still square," said Harry, testing his leg gingerly; it shook violently as he
put weight on it; he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him.
"You should've got more points on the second task," said Cedric mulishly. "You
stayed behind to get all the hostages. I should've done that."
"I was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously!" said Harry
bitterly. "Just take the cup!"
409"No," said Cedric.
He stepped over the spider's tangled legs to join Harry, who stared at him. Cedric
was serious. He was walking away from the sort of glory Hufflepuff House hadn't
had in centuries.
"Go on," Cedric said. He looked as though this was costing him every ounce of
resolution he had, but his face was set, his arms were folded, he seemed decided.
Harry looked from Cedric to the cup. For one shining moment, he saw himself
emerging from the maze, holding it. He saw himself holding the Triwizard Cup
aloft, heard the roar of the crowd, saw Cho's face shining with admiration, more
clearly than he had ever seen it before . . . and then the picture faded, and he found
himself staring at Cedric's shadowy, stubborn face.
"Both of us," Harry said.
"What?"
"We'll take it at the same time. It's still a Hogwarts victory. We'll tie for it."
Cedric stared at Harry. He unfolded his arms.
"You - you sure?"
"Yeah," said Harry. "Yeah . . . we've helped each other out, haven't we? We both
got here. Let's just take it together."
For a moment, Cedric looked as though he couldn't believe his ears; then his face
split in a grin.
"You're on," he said. "Come here."
He grabbed Harrys arm below the shoulder and helped Harry limp toward the
plinth where the cup stood. When they had reached it, they both held a hand out
over one of the cup's gleaming handles.
"On three, right?" said Harry. "One - two - three -"
He and Cedric both grasped a handle.
Instantly, Harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel. His feet had left the
ground. He could not unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was pulling
him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color, Cedric at his side.
410CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO - FLESH, BLOOD, AND BONE
Harry felt his feet slam into the ground; his injured leg gave way, and he fell
forward; his hand let go of the Triwizard Cup at last. He raised his head.
"Where are we?" he said.
Cedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his feet, and they looked
around.
They had left the Hogwarts grounds completely; they had obviously traveled miles
- perhaps hundreds of miles - for even the mountains surrounding the castle were
gone. They were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard; the black
outline of a small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right. A hill
rose above them to their left. Harry could just make out the outline of a fine old
house on the hillside.
Cedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry.
"Did anyone tell you the cup was a Portkey?" he asked.
"Nope," said Harry. He was looking around the graveyard. It was completely silent
and slightly eerie. "Is this supposed to be part of the task?"
"I dunno," said Cedric. He sounded slightly nervous. "Wands out, d'you reckon?"
"Yeah," said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion rather than him.
They pulled out their wands. Harry kept looking around him. He had, yet again,
the strange feeling that they were being watched.
"Someone's coming," he said suddenly.
Squinting tensely through the darkness, they watched the figure drawing nearer,
walking steadily toward them between the graves. Harry couldn't make out a face,
but from the way it was walking and holding its arms, he could tell that it was
carrying something. Whoever it was, he was short, and wearing a hooded cloak
pulled up over his head to obscure his face. And - several paces nearer, the gap
between them closing all the time - Harry saw that the thing in the persons arms
looked like a baby ... or was it merely a bundle of robes?
Harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric. Cedric shot him
a quizzical look. They both turned back to watch the approaching figure.
It stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet from them. For a
second. Harry and Cedric and the short figure simply looked at one another.
And then, without warning, Harry's scar exploded with pain. It was agony such as
411he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his
hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see
nothing at all; his head was about to split open.
From far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say, "Kill the spare."
A swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the night:
"Avada Kedavra!"
A blast of green light blazed through Harry's eyelids, and he heard something
heavy fall to the ground beside him; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that
he retched, and then it diminished; terrified of what he was about to see, he opened
his stinging eyes.
Cedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside him. He was dead.
For a second that contained an eternity, Harry stared into Cedric's face, at his open
gray eyes, blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted house, at his
half-open mouth, which looked slightly surprised. And then, before Harry's mind
had accepted what he was seeing, before he could feel anything but numb
disbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet.
The short man in the cloak had put down his bundle, lit his wand, and was
dragging Harry toward the marble headstone. Harry saw the name upon it
flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against it.
TOM RIDDLE
The cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around Harry, tying him from
neck to ankles to the headstone. Harry could hear shallow, fast breathing from the
depths of the hood; he struggled, and the man hit him - hit him with a hand that
had a finger missing. And Harry realized who was under the hood. It was
Wormtail.
"You!" he gasped.
But Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply; he was busy
checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably, rumbling
over the knots. Once sure that Harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he
couldn't move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black material from the
inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into Harry's mouth; then, without a word,
he turned from Harry and hurried away. Harry couldn't make a sound, nor could he
see where Wormtail had gone; he couldn't turn his head to see beyond the
headstone; he could see only what was right in front of him.
Cedric's body was lying some twenty feet away. Some way beyond him, glinting
in the starlight, lay the Triwizard Cup. Harry's wand was on the ground at Cedric's
feet. The bundle of robes that Harry had thought was a baby was close by, at the
foot of the grave. It seemed to be stirring fretfully. Harry watched it, and his scar
412seared with pain again . . . and he suddenly knew that he didn't want to see what
was in those robes ... he didn't want that bundle opened....
He could hear noises at his feet. He looked down and saw a gigantic snake
slithering through the grass, circling the headstone where he was tied. Wormtail's
fast, wheezy breathing was growing louder again. It sounded as though he was
forcing something heavy across the ground. Then he came back within Harry's
range of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the
grave. It was full of what seemed to be water - Harry could hear it slopping around
- and it was larger than any cauldron Harry had ever used; a great stone belly large
enough for a full-grown man to sit in.
The thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more persistently,
as though it was trying to free itself. Now Wormtail was busying himself at the
bottom of the cauldron with a wand. Suddenly there were crackling names beneath
it. The large snake slithered away into the darkness.
The liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast. The surface began not only to
bubble, but to send out fiery sparks, as though it were on fire. Steam was
thickening, blurring the outline of Wormtail tending the fire. The movements
beneath the robes became more agitated. And Harry heard the high, cold voice
again.
"Hurry!"
The whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now. It might have been
encrusted with diamonds.
"It is ready. Master."
"Now ..." said the cold voice.
Wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground, revealing what was inside them,
and Harry let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking his
mouth.
It was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something ugly,
slimy, and blind - but worse, a hundred times worse. The thing Wormtail had been
carrying had the shape of a crouched human child, except that Harry had never
seen anything less like a child. It was hairless and scaly-looking, a dark, raw,
reddish black. Its arms and legs were thin and feeble, and its face - no child alive
ever had a face like that - flat and snakelike, with gleaming red eyes.
The thing seemed almost helpless; it raised its thin arms, put them around
Wormtail's neck, and Wormtail lifted it. As he did so, his hood fell back, and
Harry saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail's weak, pale face in the firelight as
he carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron. For one moment, Harry saw the
evil, flat face illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of the potion. And
then Wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron; there was a hiss, and it
413vanished below the surface; Harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft
thud.
Let it drown, Harry thought, his scar burning almost past endurance, please. . . let
it drown. . . .
Wormtail was speaking. His voice shook; he seemed frightened beyond his wits.
He raised his wand, closed his eyes, and spoke to the night.
"Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you wil lrenew your son!"
The surface of the grave at Harry's feet cracked. Horrified, Harry watched as a fine
trickle of dust rose into the air at Wormtail's command and fell softly into the
cauldron. The diamond surface of the water broke and hissed; it sent sparks in all
directions and turned a vivid, poisonous-looking blue.
And now Wormtail was whimpering. He pulled a long, thin, shining silver dagger
from inside his cloak. His voice broke into petrified sobs.
"Flesh - of the servant - w-willingly given - you will - revive - your master. "
He stretched his right hand out in front of him - the hand with the missing finger.
He gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward.
Harry realized what Wormtail was about to do a second before it happened - he
closed his eyes as tightly as he could, but he could not block the scream that
pierced the night, that went through Harry as though he had been stabbed with the
dagger too. He heard something fall to the ground, heard Wormtail's anguished
panting, then a sickening splash, as something was dropped into the cauldron.
Harry couldn't stand to look . . . but the potion had turned a burning red; the light
of it shone through Harry's closed eyelids. . . .
Wormtail was gasping and moaning with agony. Not until Harry felt Wormtail's
anguished breath on his face did he realize that Wormtail was right in front of him.
"B-blood of the enemy . . . forcibly taken .. . you will. . . resurrect your foe."
Harry could do nothing to prevent it, he was tied too tightly. . .. Squinting down,
struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him, he saw the shining silver dagger
shaking in Wormtails remaining hand. He felt its point penetrate the crook of his
right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes. Wormtail, still
panting with pain, rumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and held it to Harry's cut,
so that a dribble of blood fell into it.
He staggered back to the cauldron with Harrys blood. He poured it inside. The
liquid within turned, instantly, a blinding white. Wormtail, his job done, dropped
to his knees beside the cauldron, then slumped sideways and lay on the ground,
cradling the bleeding stump of his arm, gasping and sobbing.
The cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond sparks in all directions, so
414blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety blackness. Nothing happened. . . .
Let it have drowned. Harry thought, let it have gone wrong. . . •
And then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished. A
surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead, obliterating
everything in front of Harry, so that he couldn't see Wormtail or Cedric or
anything but vapor hanging in the air. ... It's gone wrong, he thought. . . it's
drowned. .. please . . . please let it be dead. ...
But then, through the mist in front of him, he saw, with an icy surge of terror, the
dark outline of a man, tall and skeletally thin, rising slowly from inside the
cauldron.
"Robe me," said the high, cold voice from behind the steam, and Wormtail,
sobbing and moaning, still cradling his mutilated arm, scrambled to pick up the
black robes from the ground, got to his feet, reached up, and pulled them one-
handed over his master's head.
The thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at Harry . . . and Harry stared
back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years. Whiter than a
skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snakes with slits
for nostrils . . .
Lord Voldemort had risen again.
415CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE - THE DEATH EATERS
Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body. His
hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest,
his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cats, gleamed still
more brightly through the darkness. He held up his hands and flexed the fingers,
his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who
lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had
slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped
one of those unnaturally long-fingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a
wand. He caressed it gently too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail,
who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was
tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort
turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh.
Wormtail's robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump of his
arm in them.
"My Lord . . ." he choked, "my Lord . . . you promised . . . you did promise ..."
"Hold out your arm," said Voldemort lazily.
"Oh Master . . . thank you, Master ..."
He extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again.
"The other arm, Wormtail."
"Master, please . . .please ..."
Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail's left arm; he forced the sleeve of
Wormtail's robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin there,
something like a vivid red tattoo - a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth -
the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark
Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail's uncontrollable
weeping.
"It is back," he said softly, "they will all have noticed it... and now, we shall see ...
now we shall know ..."
He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm.
The scar on Harry s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out
a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's mark, and Harry
saw that it had turned jet black.
A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up, threw back his
416head, and stared around at the dark graveyard.
"How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?" he whispered, his
gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. "And how many will be foolish enough to
stay away?"
He began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes sweeping the
graveyard all the while. After a minute or so, he looked down at Harry again, a
cruel smile twisting his snakelike face.
"You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father," he hissed softly. "A
Muggle and a fool. . . very like your dear mother. But they both had their uses, did
they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child . . . and I killed my father, and
see how useful he has proved himself, in death. ..."
Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him as he
walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass.
"You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My mother, a
witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him. But he abandoned her
when she told him what she was. ... He didn't like magic, my father . . .
"He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born. Potter, and
she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage . . . but
I vowed to find him ... I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his
name . . . Tom Riddle. . . ."
Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave.
"Listen to me, reliving family history . . ." he said quietly, "why, I am growing
quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry! My true family returns. . . ."
The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between graves, behind the
yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them were
hooded and masked. And one by one they moved forward . . . slowly, cautiously,
as though they could
hardly believe their eyes Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them. Then one
of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort and kissed the
hem of his black robes.
Master . . . Master " he murmured.
The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort
on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming
a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle s grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the
sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps in the circle, as
though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect
more. He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind
rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered.
417"Welcome, Death Eaters," said Voldemort quietly. "Thirteen years. . . thirteen
years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday, we
are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or are we?"
He put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slit-like nostrils widening.
"I smell guilt," he said. "There is a stench or guilt upon the air.
A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but did
not dare to step back from him.
"I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact - such prompt
appearances! and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to the
aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?"
No one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground, still
sobbing over his bleeding arm.
"And I answer myself," whispered Voldemort, "they must have believed me
broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back among my enemies, and they
pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . .
"And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again?
They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death?
They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was
mightier than any wizard living?
"And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one
that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort. . . perhaps they now pay allegiance to
another . . . perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles,
Albus Dumbledore?"
At the mention of Dumbledore's name, the members of the circle stirred, and some
muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them.
"It is a disappointment to me ... I confess myself disappointed. . . ."
One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling
from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort's feet.
"Master!" he shrieked, "Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!"
Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand.
"Crucio!"
The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound
must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he thought desperately . .
. anyone . .. anything. . .
Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground,
418gasping.
"Get up, Avery," said Voldemort softly. "Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do
not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years ... I want thirteen years' repayment
before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you
not, Wormtail?"
He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob.
"You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You
deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don't you?"
"Yes, Master," moaned Wormtail, "please. Master . . . please ..."
"Yet you helped return me to my body," said Voldemort coolly, watching
Wormtail sob on the ground. "Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me
... and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers... ."
Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what
looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake. Momentarily
shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human
hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon
Wormtails bleeding wrist.
Wormtail's sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised
his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his
arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers,
then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder.
"My Lord," he whispered. "Master ... it is beautiful. . . thank you... thank you. ..."
He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort's robes.
"May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail," said Voldemort.
"No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . ."
Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new
hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on
Wormtail's right.
"Lucius, my slippery friend," he whispered, halting before him. "I am told that you
have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable
face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle-torture, I believe? Yet
you never tried to find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup
were fun, I daresay. . . but might not your energies have been better directed
toward finding and aiding your master?"
"My Lord, I was constantly on the alert," came Lucius Malfoy's voice swiftly from
beneath the hood. "Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your
419whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have
prevented me -"
"And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky
last summer?" said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly.
"Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed me. ... I expect
more faithful service in the future."
"Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. ..."
Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space - large enough for two
people - that separated Malfoy and the next man.
"The Lestranges should stand here," said Voldemort quietly. "But they are
entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than
renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be honored
beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us ... they are our natural allies ... we
will recall the banished giants ... I shall have all my devoted servants returned to
me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. ..."
He walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused
before others and spoke to them.
"Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now,
Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord
Voldemort will provide. ..."
"Thank you, Master . . . thank you," murmured Macnair.
"And here" - Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures - "we have
Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle?"
They bowed clumsily, muttering dully.
"Yes, Master ..."
"We will, Master...."
"The same goes for you, Nott," said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a
stooped figure in Mr. Goyles shadow.
"My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful -"
"That will do," said Voldemort.
He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red
eyes, as though he could see people standing there.
"And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my service. One,
too cowardly to return ... he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever ... he
will be killed, of course . . . and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and
420who has already reentered my service."
The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another
through their masks.
"He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our
young friend arrived here tonight. . . .
"Yes," said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle
flashed in Harry's direction. "Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing
party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor."
There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped
forward, and Lucius Malfoy's voice spoke from under the mask.
"Master, we crave to know ... we beg you to tell us ... how you have achieved this .
. . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to us. .. ."
"Ah, what a story it is, Lucius," said Voldemort. "And it begins - and ends - with
my young friend here."
He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle
were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle.
"You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?" Voldemort
said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he
almost screamed in agony. "You all know that on the night I lost my powers and
my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the attempt to save him - and
unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. ... I could
not touch the boy."
Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry's
cheek.
"His mother left upon him the traces other sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I should
have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it... but no matter. I can touch him
now."
Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head
would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the
finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters.
"I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the woman's
foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain, my
friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped from my body, I was
less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive. What I was,
even I do not know... I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that
leads to immortality. You know my goal - to conquer death. And now, I was
tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked ... for I had
not been killed, though the curse should have done it. Nevertheless, I was as
421powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself...
for I had no body, and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a
wand. . . .
"I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to
exist. ... I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited. . . . Surely, one of
my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me. . . one of them would come and
perform the magic I could not, to restore me to a body . . , but I waited in vain. ..."
The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters. Voldemort
let the silence spiral horribly before continuing.
"Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others. But I dared
not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors were still
abroad and searching for me.
I sometimes inhabited animals - snakes, of course, being my preference - but I was
little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to
perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their lives; none of them
lasted long. . . .
"Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured. A wizard -
young, foolish, and gullible - wandered across my path in the forest I had made
my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of... for he was a
teacher at Dumbledore's school... he was easy to bend to my will... he brought me
back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise
him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed. I did not manage to
steal the Sorcerer's Stone. I was not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted . . .
thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. ..."
Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree. The
Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon
Voldemort, and upon Harry.
"The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had been,"
Voldemort continued. "I returned to my hiding place far away, and I will not
pretend to you that I didn't then fear that I might never regain my powers. . . . Yes,
that was perhaps my darkest hour... I could not hope that I would be sent another
wizard to possess . . . and I had given up hope, now, that any of my Death Eaters
cared what had become of me. ..."
One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but
Voldemort took no notice.
"And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned hope, it happened at
last... a servant returned to me. Wormtail here, who had faked his own death to
escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and
decided to return to his master. He sought me in the country where it had long
been rumored I was hiding . . . helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way.
422Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not, Wormtail? His filthy little
friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided,
where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that
possessed them. . . .
"But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail? For, hungry one
night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly
stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who should he meet there, but one Bertha
Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry of Magic.
"Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might have been the end
of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail - displaying a
presence of mind I would never have expected from him - convinced Bertha
Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll. He overpowered her ... he brought
her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved instead to be a
gift beyond my wildest dreams ... for - with a little persuasion - she became a
veritable mine of information.
"She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this
year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too
willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She told me many things. . . but the
means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and when I
had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body were both
damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her.
I disposed of her."
Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless.
"Wormtail's body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him
dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he was the
able-bodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to
follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak
body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential
ingredients for true rebirth ... a spell or two of my own invention ... a little help
from my dear Nagini," Voldemorts red eyes fell upon the continually circling
snake, "a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini
provided ... I was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong enough to
travel.
"There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer's Stone anymore, for I knew that
Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to
embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower ... I
would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength.
"I knew that to achieve this - it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that
revived me tonight - I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of them
was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant. . . .
423"My father's bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here, where he
was buried. But the blood of a foe ... Wormtail would have had me use any
wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated me ... as so many of
them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful
than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potters blood. I wanted the
blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . for the
lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too. .
"But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better protected than I think even
he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him
to arrange the boy's future. Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the
boy's protection as long as he is in his relations' care. Not even I can touch him
there. . . . Then, of course, there was the Quidditch World Cup. ... I thought his
protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I
was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry
wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where he is under the
crooked nose of that Muggle-loving fool from morning until night. So how could I
take him?
"Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins's information, of course. Use my one faithful
Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy's name was entered into
the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament
- that he touched the Triwizard Cup first - the cup which my Death Eater had
turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach of
Dumbledore's help and protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is ... the
boy you all believed had been my downfall. ..."
Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised his wand.
"Crucio!"
It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on
fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling madly in his
head; he wanted it to end ... to black out... to die ...
And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the
headstone of Voldemort's father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a
kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters' laughter.
"You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been
stronger than me," said Voldemort. "But I want there to be no mistake in
anybody's mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I am now going
to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is
no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his
chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is
the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini," he whispered, and the snake glided away
through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching.
424"Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand."
425CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR - PRIORI INCANTATEM
Wormtail approached Harry, who scrambled to find his feet, to support his own
weight before the ropes were untied. Wormtail raised his new silver hand, pulled
out the wad of material gagging Harry, and then, with one swipe, cut through the
bonds tying Harry to the gravestone.
There was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might have considered running for
it, but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave, as the
Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter circle around him and Voldemort, so
that the gaps where the missing Death Eaters should have stood were filled.
Wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where Cedric's body lay and
returned with Harry's wand, which he thrust roughly into Harry's hand without
looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed his place in the circle of watching Death
Eaters.
"You have been taught how to duel. Harry Potter?" said Voldemort softly, his red
eyes glinting through the darkness.
At these words Harry remembered, as though from a former life, the dueling club
at Hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago. ... All he had learned there was
the Disarming Spell, "Expelliarmus". . . and what use would it be to deprive
Voldemort of his wand, even if he could, when he was surrounded by Death
Eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one? He had never learned anything that
could possibly fit him for this. He knew he was facing the thing against which
Moody had always warned . . . the unblockable Avada Kedavra curse - and
Voldemort was right - his mother was not here to die for him this time. ... He was
quite unprotected. . . .
"We bow to each other. Harry," said Voldemort, bending a little, but keeping his
snakelike face upturned to Harry. "Come, the niceties must be observed. . . .
Dumbledore would like you to show manners. . . . Bow to death, Harry. ..."
The Death Eaters were laughing again. Voldemorts lipless mouth was smiling.
Harry did not bow. He was not going to let Voldemort play with him before killing
him ... he was not going to give him that satisfaction. . . .
"I said, bow," Voldemort said, raising his wand - and Harry felt his spine curve as
though a huge, invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward, and the Death
Eaters laughed harder than ever.
"Very good," said Voldemort softly, and as he raised his wand the pressure
bearing down upon Harry lifted too. "And now you face me, like a man . . .
straight-backed and proud, the way your father died. . . .
"And now - we duel."
426Voldemort raised his wand, and before Harry could do anything to defend himself,
before he could even move, he had been hit again by the Cruciatus Curse. The
pain was so intense, so all-consuming, that he no longer knew where he was. . . .
White-hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going
to burst with pain, he was screaming more loudly than he'd ever screamed in his
life -
And then it stopped. Harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet; he was shaking
as uncontrollably as Wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off; he
staggered sideways into the wall of watching Death Eaters, and they pushed him
away, back toward Voldemort.
"A little break," said Voldemort, the slit-like nostrils dilating with excitement, "a
little pause . . . That hurt, didn't it. Harry? You don't want me to do that again, do
you?"
Harry didn't answer. He was going to die like Cedric, those pitiless red eyes were
telling him so ... he was going to die, and there was nothing he could do about it...
but he wasn't going to play along. He wasn't going to obey Voldemort... he wasn't
going to beg. . . .
"I asked you whether you want me to do that again," said Voldemort softly.
"Answer me! Imperial"
And Harry felt, for the third time in his life, the sensation that his mind had been
wiped of all thought. . . . Ah, it was bliss, not to think, it was as though he were
floating, dreaming ...just answer no ... say no ... just answer no. .. .
I will not, said a stronger voice, in the back of his head, I won't answer. . . .
Just answer no. . . .
I won't do it, I won't say it. ...
Just answer no. . . .
"I WON'T!"
And these words burst from Harry's mouth; they echoed through the graveyard,
and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been thrown
over him - back rushed the aches that the Cruciatus Curse had left all over his
body - back rushed the realization of where he was, and what he was facing. . . .
"You won't?" said Voldemort quietly, and the Death Eaters were not laughing
now. "You won't say no? Harry, obedience is a virtue I need to teach you before
you die. . . . Perhaps another little dose of pain?"
Voldemort raised his wand, but this time Harry was ready; with the reflexes born
of his Quidditch training, he flung himself sideways onto the ground; he rolled
behind the marble headstone of Voldemort s father, and he heard it crack as the
427curse missed him.
"We are not playing hide-and-seek, Harry," said Voldemort's soft, cold voice,
drawing nearer, as the Death Eaters laughed. "You cannot hide from me. Does this
mean you are tired of our duel? Does this mean that you would prefer me to finish
it now, Harry? Come out, Harry . . . come out and play, then ... it will be quick ... it
might even be painless ... I would not know... I have never died. . . ."
Harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come. There was no
hope ... no help to be had. And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew
one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason: He was not going to die
crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die
kneeling at Voldemort s feet... he was going to die upright like his father, and he
was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defense was possible. . . .
Before Voldemort could stick his snakelike face around the headstone. Harry
stood up ... he gripped his wand tightly in his hand, thrust it out in front of him,
and threw himself around the headstone, facing Voldemort.
Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted, "Expelliarmus!" Voldemort cried,
"Avada Kedavra!"
A jet of green light issued from Voldemorts wand just as a jet of red light blasted
from Harry's - they met in midair - and suddenly Harry's wand was vibrating as
though an electric charge were surging through it; his hand seized up around it; he
couldn't have released it if he'd wanted to - and a narrow beam of light connected
the two wands, neither red nor green, but bright, deep gold. Harry, following the
beam with his astonished gaze, saw that Voldemort's long white fingers too were
gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating.
And then - nothing could have prepared Harry for this - he felt his feet lift from
the ground. He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air, their wands still
connected by that thread of shimmering golden light. They glided away from the
tombstone of Voldemort's father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that
was clear and free of graves. . . . The Death Eaters were shouting; they were
asking Voldemort for instructions; they were closing in, reforming the circle
around Harry and Voldemort, the snake slithering at their heels, some of them
drawing their wands -
The golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort splintered; though the wands
remained connected, a thousand more beams arced high over Harry and
Voldemort, crisscrossing all around them, until they were enclosed in a golden,
dome-shaped web, a
cage of light, beyond which the Death Eaters circled like jackals, their cries
strangely muffled now. . . .
"Do nothing!" Voldemort shrieked to the Death Eaters, and Harry saw his red eyes
wide with astonishment at what was happening, saw him fighting to break the
428thread of light still connecting his wand with Harry's; Harry held onto his wand
more tightly, with both hands, and the golden thread remained unbroken. "Do
nothing unless I command you!" Voldemort shouted to the Death Eaters.
And then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air. ... It was coming from
every thread of the light-spun web vibrating around Harry and Voldemort. It was a
sound Harry recognized, though he had heard it only once before in his life:
phoenix song.
It was the sound of hope to Harry. . . the most beautiful and welcome thing he had
ever heard in his life. . . . He felt as though the song were inside him instead of just
around him. ... It was the sound he connected with Dumbledore, and it was almost
as though a friend were speaking in his ear. . . .
Don't break the connection.
I know. Harry told the music, I know I mustn't. . . but no sooner had he thought it,
than the thing became much harder to do. His wand began to vibrate more
powerfully than ever . . . and now the beam between him and Voldemort changed
too ... it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread
connecting the wands - Harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand as the
light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his way. . . . The direction of the
beams movement was now toward him, from Voldemort, and he felt his wand
shudder angrily. . . .
As the closest bead of light moved nearer to Harrys wand tip, the wood beneath
his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame. The closer that bead
moved, the harder Harry's wand vibrated; he was sure his wand would not survive
contact with it; it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers -
He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back toward
Voldemort, his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixed . . . and slowly,
very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to
move the other way . . . and it was Voldemort's wand that was vibrating extra-hard
now . . . Voldemort who looked astonished, and almost fearful. . . .
One of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemorts wand.
Harry didn't understand why he was doing it, didn't know what it might achieve . .
. but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of
light right back into Voldemort s wand . . . and slowly . . . very slowly ... it moved
along the golden thread ... it trembled for a moment. . . and then it connected. . . .
At once, Voldemorts wand began to emit echoing screams of pain . . . then -
Voldemort's red eyes widened with shock - a dense, smoky hand flew out of the
tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand he had made Wormtail. . . more
shouts of pain . . . and then something much larger began to blossom from
Voldemorts wand tip, a great, grayish something, that looked as though it were
made of the solidest, densest smoke. ... It was a head . . . now a chest and arms . . .
429the torso of Cedric Diggory.
If ever Harry might have released his wand from shock, it would have been then,
but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of golden light
remained unbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric Diggory (was it a
ghost? it looked so
solid) emerged in its entirety from the end of Voldemort s wand, as though it were
squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunnel. . . and this shade of Cedric stood up,
and looked up and down the golden thread of light, and spoke.
"Hold on. Harry," it said.
Its voice was distant and echoing. Harry looked at Voldemort ... his wide red eyes
were still shocked ... he had no more expected this than Harry had . . . and, very
dimly. Harry heard the frightened yells of the Death Eaters, prowling around the
edges of the golden dome. .
More screams of pain from the wand . . . and then something else emerged from
its tip ... the dense shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms and torso ...
an old man Harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the
end of the wand just as Cedric had done . . . and his ghost, or his shadow, or
whatever it was, fell next to Cedric's, and surveyed Harry and Voldemort, and the
golden web, and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning on his walking
stick. . . .
"He was a real wizard, then?" the old man said, his eyes on Voldemort. "Killed
me, that one did. . . . You fight him, boy. . . ."
But already, yet another head was emerging ... and this head, gray as a smoky
statue, was a woman's. . . . Harry, both arms shaking now as he fought to keep his
wand still, saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others, staring. . . .
The shadow of Bertha Jorkins surveyed the battle before her with wide eyes.
"Don't let go, now!" she cried, and her voice echoed like Cedrics as though from
very far away. "Don't let him get you, Harry - don't let go!"
She and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the
golden web, while the Death Eaters flitted around the outside of it... and
Voldemort's dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers, whispered words
of encouragement to Harry, and hissed words Harry couldn't hear to Voldemort.
And now another head was emerging from the tip of Voldemorts wand . . . and
Harry knew when he saw it who it would be ... he knew, as though he had
expected it from the moment when Cedric had appeared from the wand . . . knew,
because the man appearing was the one he'd thought of more than any other
tonight. . . .
The smoky shadow of a tall man with untidy hair fell to the ground as Bertha had
430done, straightened up, and looked at him . . . and Harry, his arms shaking madly
now, looked back into the ghostly face of his father.
"Your mother's coming . . ." he said quietly. "She wants to see you ... it will be all
right.. . hold on. . . ."
And she came. . . first her head, then her body... a young woman with long hair,
the smoky, shadowy form of Lily Potter blossomed from the end of Voldemort's
wand, fell to the ground, and straightened like her husband. She walked close to
Harry, looking down at him, and she spoke in the same distant, echoing voice as
the others, but quietly, so that Voldemort, his face now livid with fear as his
victims prowled around him, could not hear. . ..
"When the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments . . . but we will
give you time. . . you must get to the Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts ... do
you understand, Harry?"
"Yes," Harry gasped, fighting now to keep a hold on his wand, which was slipping
and sliding beneath his fingers.
"Harry . . ." whispered the figure of Cedric, "take my body back, will you? Take
my body back to my parents, ..."
"I will," said Harry, his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand.
"Do it now," whispered his father's voice, "be ready to run . . . do it now. ..."
"NOW!" Harry yelled; he didn't think he could have held on for another moment
anyway - he pulled his wand upward with an almighty wrench, and the golden
thread broke; the cage of light vanished, the phoenix song died - but the shadowy
figures of Voldemort's victims did not disappear - they were closing in upon
Voldemort, shielding Harry from his gaze -
And Harry ran as he had never run in his life, knocking two stunned Death Eaters
aside as he passed; he zigzagged behind headstones, feeling their curses following
him, hearing them hit the headstones - he was dodging curses and graves, pelting
toward Cedric's body, no longer aware of the pain in his leg, his whole being
concentrated on what he had to do -
"Stun him!" he heard Voldemort scream.
Ten feet from Cedric, Harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red
light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it. Gripping his wand more
tightly, he dashed out from behind the angel -
"Impedimenta!" he bellowed, pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the
Death Eaters running at him.
From a muffled yell, he thought he had stopped at least one of them, but there was
no time to stop and look; he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard more
431wand blasts behind him; more jets of light flew over his head as he fell, stretching
out his hand to grab Cedric's arm...
"Stand aside! I will kill him! He is mine!" shrieked Voldemort. Harry's hand had
closed on Cedric's wrist; one tombstone stood between him and Voldemort, but
Cedric was too heavy to carry, and the cup was out of reach -
Voldemort's red eyes flamed in the darkness. Harry saw his mouth curl into a
smile, saw him raise his wand.
"Accio!" Harry yelled, pointing his wand at the Triwizard Cup. It flew into the air
and soared toward him. Harry caught it by the handle -
He heard Voldemort s scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the jerk
behind his navel that meant the Portkey had worked - it was speeding him away in
a whirl of wind and color, and Cedric along with him. . . . They were going back.
432CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE - VERITASERUM
Harry felt himself slam flat into the ground; his face was pressed into grass; the
smell of it filled his nostrils. He had closed his eyes while the Portkey transported
him, and he kept them closed now. He did not move. All the breath seemed to
have been knocked out of him; his head was swimming so badly he felt as though
the ground beneath him were swaying like the deck of a ship. To hold himself
steady, he tightened his hold on the two things he was still clutching: the smooth,
cold handle of the Triwizard Cup and Cedric's body. He felt as though he would
slide away into the blackness gathering at the edges of his brain if he let go of
either of them. Shock and exhaustion kept him on the ground, breathing in the
smell of the grass, waiting . . . waiting for someone to do something . . . something
to happen . . . and all the while, his scar burned dully on his forehead. . . .
A torrent of sound deafened and confused him; there were voices everywhere,
footsteps, screams. ... He remained where he was, his face screwed up against the
noise, as though it were a nightmare that would pass. . . .
Then a pair of hands seized him roughly and turned him over.
"Harry! Harry!"
He opened his eyes.
He was looking up at the starry sky, and Albus Dumbledore was crouched over
him. The dark shadows of a crowd of people pressed in around them, pushing
nearer; Harry felt the ground beneath his head reverberating with their footsteps.
He had come back to the edge of the maze. He could see the stands rising above
him, the shapes of people moving in them, the stars above.
Harry let go of the cup, but he clutched Cedric to him even more tightly. He raised
his free hand and seized Dumbledore's wrist, while Dumbledore's face swam in
and out of focus.
"He's back," Harry whispered. "He's back. Voldemort."
"What's going on? What's happened?"
The face of Cornelius Fudge appeared upside down over Harry; it looked white,
appalled.
"My God - Diggory!" it whispered. "Dumbledore - he's dead!"
The words were repeated, the shadowy figures pressing in on them gasped it to
those around them . . . and then others shouted it - screeched it - into the night -
"He's dead!" "He's dead!" "Cedric Diggory! Dead!"
433"Harry, let go of him," he heard Fudge's voice say, and he felt fingers trying to pry
him from Cedric's limp body, but Harry wouldn't let him go. Then Dumbledore's
face, which was still blurred and misted, came closer.
"Harry, you can't help him now. It's over. Let go."
"He wanted me to bring him back," Harry muttered - it seemed important to
explain this. "He wanted me to bring him back to his parents. ..."
"That's right. Harry . . . just let go now. . . ."
Dumbledore bent down, and with extraordinary strength for a man so old and thin,
raised Harry from the ground and set -him on his feet. Harry swayed. His head
was pounding. His injured leg would no longer support his weight. The crowd
around them jostled, fighting to get closer, pressing darkly in on him - "What's
happened?" "What's wrong with him?" "Diggorys dead!"
"He'll need to go to the hospital wing!" Fudge was saying loudly. "He's ill, he's
injured - Dumbledore, Diggory's parents, they're here, they're in the stands. ..."
"I'll take Harry, Dumbledore, I'll take him -"
"No, I would prefer-"
"Dumbledore, Amos Diggorys running . . . he's coming over. . . . Don't you think
you should tell him - before he sees - ?"
"Harry, stay here -"
Girls were screaming, sobbing hysterically.... The scene flickered oddly before
Harry's eyes. . . .
"Its all right, son, I've got you . . . come on ... hospital wing . . ."
"Dumbledore said stay," said Harry thickly, the pounding in his scar making him
feel as though he was about to throw up; his vision was blurring worse than ever.
"You need to lie down. . .. Come on now...."
Someone larger and stronger than he was was half pulling, half carrying him
through the frightened crowd. Harry heard people gasping, screaming, and
shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them, taking him back
to the castle. Across the lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship, Harry heard
nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk.
"What happened. Harry?" the man asked at last as he lifted Harry up the stone
steps. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. It was Mad-Eye Moody.
"Cup was a Portkey," said Harry as they crossed the entrance hall. "Took me and
Cedric to a graveyard . . . and Voldemort was there . . . Lord Voldemort..."
434Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Up the marble stairs . . .
"The Dark Lord was there? What happened then?"
"Killed Cedric . . . they killed Cedric. . . ."
"And then?"
Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Along the corridor . . .
"Made a potion . . . got his body back. . . ."
"The Dark Lord got his body back? He's returned?"
"And the Death Eaters came . . . and then we dueled. ..."
"You dueled with the Dark Lord?"
"Got away . . . my wand . . . did something funny. ... I saw my mum and dad . . .
they came out of his wand. ..."
"In here. Harry ... in here, and sit down. . . . You'll be all right now . . . drink this.
..."
Harry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed into his hands.
"Drink it... you'll feel better . . . come on, now. Harry, I need to know exactly what
happened. ..."
Moody helped tip the stuff down Harrys throat; he coughed, a peppery taste
burning his throat. Moody's office came into sharper focus, and so did Moody
himself. ... He looked as white as Fudge had looked, and both eyes were fixed
unblinkingly upon Harry's face.
"Voldemort's back, Harry? You're sure he's back? How did he do it?"
"He took stuff from his father's grave, and from Wormtail, and me," said Harry.
His head felt clearer; his scar wasn't hurting so badly; he could now see Moodys
face distinctly, even though the office was dark. He could still hear screaming and
shouting from the distant Quidditch field.
"What did the Dark Lord take from you?" said Moody.
"Blood," said Harry, raising his arm. His sleeve was ripped where Wormtail's
dagger had torn it.
Moody let out his breath in a long, low hiss.
"And the Death Eaters? They returned?"
"Yes," said Harry. "Loads of them . . ."
"How did he treat them?" Moody asked quietly. "Did he forgive them?"
435But Harry had suddenly remembered. He should have told Dumbledore, he should
have said it straightaway -
"There's a Death Eater at Hogwarts! There's a Death Eater here - they put my
name in the Goblet of Fire, they made sure I got through to the end -"
Harry tried to get up, but Moody pushed him back down.
"I know who the Death Eater is," he said quietly.
"Karkaroff?" said Harry wildly. "Where is he? Have you got him? Is he locked
up?"
"Karkaroff?" said Moody with an odd laugh. "Karkaroff fled tonight, when he felt
the Dark Mark burn upon his arm. He betrayed too many faithful supporters of the
Dark Lord to wish to meet them . . . but I doubt he will get far. The Dark Lord has
ways of tracking his enemies."
"Karkaroff's gone? He ran away? But then - he didn't put my name in the goblet?"
"No," said Moody slowly. "No, he didn't. It was I who did that."
Harry heard, but didn't believe.
"No, you didn't," he said. "You didn't do that. . . you can't have done..."
"I assure you I did," said Moody, and his magical eye swung around and fixed
upon the door, and Harry knew he was making sure that there was no one outside
it. At the same time, Moody drew out his wand and pointed it at Harry.
"He forgave them, then?" he said. "The Death Eaters who went free? The ones
who escaped Azkaban?"
"What?" said Harry.
He was looking at the wand Moody was pointing at him. This was a bad joke, it
had to be.
"I asked you," said Moody quietly, "whether he forgave the scum who never even
went to look for him. Those treacherous cowards who wouldn't even brave
Azkaban for him. The faithless, worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to
cavort in masks at the Quidditch World Cup, but fled at the sight of the Dark Mark
when I fired it into the sky."
"You fired . . . What are you talking about. . . ?"
"I told you. Harry ... I told you. If there's one thing I hate more than any other, it's
a Death Eater who walked free. They turned their backs on my master when he
needed them most. I expected him to punish them. I expected him to torture them.
Tell me he
436hurt them, Harry. . . ." Moody's face was suddenly lit with an insane smile. "Tell
me he told them that I, I alone remained faithful... prepared to risk everything to
deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all... you"
"You didn't... it - it can't be you. ..."
"Who put your name in the Goblet of Fire, under the name of a different school? I
did. Who frightened off every person I thought might try to hurt you or prevent
you from winning the tournament? I did. Who nudged Hagrid into showing you
the dragons? I did. Who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon? I
did"
Moody's magical eye had now left the door. It was fixed upon Harry. His lopsided
mouth leered more widely than ever.
"It hasn't been easy, Harry, guiding you through these tasks without arousing
suspicion. I have had to use every ounce of cunning I possess, so that my hand
would not be detectable in your success. Dumbledore would have been very
suspicious if you had managed everything too easily. As long as you got into that
maze, preferably with a decent head start - then, I knew, I would have a chance of
getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way clear. But I also had to
contend with your stupidity. The second task . . . that was when I was most afraid
we would fail. I was keeping watch on you, Potter. I knew you hadn't worked out
the egg's clue, so I had to give you another hint -"
"You didn't," Harry said hoarsely. "Cedric gave me the clue -"
"Who told Cedric to open it underwater? I did. I trusted that he would pass the
information on to you. Decent people are so easy to manipulate, Potter. I was sure
Cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons, and so he did.
But even then,
Potter, even then you seemed likely to fail. I was watching all the time ... all those
hours in the library. Didn't you realize that the book you needed was in your
dormitory all along? I planted it there early on, I gave it to the Longbottom boy,
don't you remember? Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean. It would have
told you all you needed to know about gillyweed. I expected you to ask everyone
and anyone you could for help. Longbottom would have told you in an instant. But
you did not. . . you did not. . . . You have a streak of pride and independence that
might have ruined all.
"So what could I do? Feed you information from another innocent source. You
told me at the Yule Ball a house-elf called Dobby had given you a Christmas
present. I called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning. I staged
a loud conversation with Professor McGonagall about the hostages who had been
taken, and whether Potter would think to use gillyweed. And your little elf friend
ran straight to Snape's office and then hurried to find you..."
Moodys wand was still pointing directly at Harry's heart. Over his shoulder, foggy
437shapes were moving in the Foe-Glass on the wall.
"You were so long in that lake, Potter, I thought you had drowned. But luckily,
Dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility, and marked you high for it. I breathed
again.
"You had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight, of
course," said Moody. "I was patrolling around it, able to see through the outer
hedges, able to curse many obstacles out of your way. I Stunned Fleur Delacour as
she passed. I put the Imperius Curse on Krum, so that he would finish Diggory and
leave your path to the cup clear."
Harry stared at Moody. He just didn't see how this could be. ... Dumbledore's
friend, the famous Auror. . . the one who had caught so many Death Eaters ... It
made no sense ... no sense at all. ...
The foggy shapes in the Foe-Glass were sharpening, had become more distinct.
Harry could see the outlines of three people over Moody's shoulder, moving closer
and closer. But Moody wasn't watching them. His magical eye was upon Harry.
"The Dark Lord didn't manage to kill you. Potter, and he so wanted to," whispered
Moody. "Imagine how he will reward me when he finds I have done it for him. I
gave you to him - the thing he needed above all to regenerate - and then I killed
you for him. I will be honored beyond all other Death Eaters. I will be his dearest,
his closest supporter . . . closer than a son. ..."
Moody's normal eye was bulging, the magical eye fixed upon Harry. The door was
barred, and Harry knew he would never reach his own wand in time. . . .
"The Dark Lord and I," said Moody, and he looked completely insane now,
towering over Harry, leering down at him, "have much in common. Both of us, for
instance, had very disappointing fathers . . . very disappointing indeed. Both of us
suffered the indignity, Harry, of being named after those fathers. And both of us
had the pleasure . . . the very great pleasure ... of killing our fathers to ensure the
continued rise of the Dark Order!"
"You're mad," Harry said - he couldn't stop himself- "you're mad!"
"Mad, am I?" said Moody, his voice rising uncontrollably. "We'll see! We'll see
who's mad, now that the Dark Lord has returned, with me at his side! He is back,
Harry Potter, you did not conquer him - and now - I conquer you!"
Moody raised his wand, he opened his mouth; Harry plunged his own hand into
his robes -
"Stupefy!" There was a blinding flash of red light, and with a great splintering and
crashing, the door of Moody's office was blasted apart -
Moody was thrown backward onto the office floor. Harry, still staring at the place
where Moody's face had been, saw Albus Dumbledore, Professor Snape, and
438Professor McGonagall looking back at him out of the Foe-Glass. He looked
around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway, Dumbledore in front,
his wand outstretched.
At that moment, Harry fully understood for the first time why people said
Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort had ever feared. The look upon
Dumbledore's face as he stared down at the unconscious form of Mad-Eye Moody
was more terrible than Harry could have ever imagined. There was no benign
smile upon Dumbledore's face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles. There
was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of power radiated from
Dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat.
He stepped into the office, placed a foot underneath Moodys unconscious body,
and kicked him over onto his back, so that his face was visible. Snape followed
him, looking into the Foe-Glass, where his own face was still visible, glaring into
the room. Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry.
"Come along, Potter," she whispered. The thin line of her mouth was twitching as
though she was about to cry. "Come along . . . hospital wing ..."
"No," said Dumbledore sharply.
"Dumbledore, he ought to - look at him - he's been through enough tonight -"
"He will stay, Minerva, because he needs to understand," said Dumbledore curtly.
"Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there
be recovery. He needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered
tonight, and why,"
"Moody," Harry said. He was still in a state of complete disbelief. "How can it
have been Moody?"
"This is not Alastor Moody," said Dumbledore quietly. "You have never known
Alastor Moody. The real Moody would not have removed you from my sight after
what happened tonight. The moment he took you, I knew - and I followed."
Dumbledore bent down over Moody's limp form and put a hand inside his robes.
He pulled out Moody's hip flask and a set of keys on a ring. Then he turned to
Professors McGonagall and Snape.
"Severus, please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess, and then go
down to the kitchens and bring up the house-elf called Winky. Minerva, kindly go
down to Hagrid's house, where you will find a large black dog sitting in the
pumpkin patch. Take the dog up to my office, tell him I will be with him shortly,
then come back here."
If either Snape or McGonagall found these instructions peculiar, they hid their
confusion. Both turned at once and left the office. Dumbledore walked over to the
trunk with seven locks, fitted the first key in the lock, and opened it. It contained a
439mass of spell-books. Dumbledore closed the trunk, placed a second key in the
second lock, and opened the trunk again. The spellbooks had vanished; this time it
contained an assortment of broken Sneako-scopes, some parchment and quills, and
what looked like a silvery Invisibility Cloak. Harry watched, astounded, as
Dumbledore placed the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth keys in their respective locks,
reopening the trunk each time, and revealing different contents each time. Then he
placed the seventh key in the lock, threw open the lid, and Harry let out a cry of
amazement.
He was looking down into a kind of pit, an underground room, and lying on the
floor some ten feet below, apparently fast asleep, thin and starved in appearance,
was the real Mad-Eye Moody. His wooden leg was gone, the socket that should
have held the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid, and chunks of his grizzled
hair were missing. Harry stared, thunderstruck, between the sleeping Moody in the
trunk and the unconscious Moody lying on the floor of the office.
Dumbledore climbed into the trunk, lowered himself, and fell lightly onto the floor
beside the sleeping Moody. He bent over him.
"Stunned - controlled by the Imperius Curse - very weak," he said. "Of course,
they would have needed to keep him alive. Harry, throw down the imposter's cloak
- he's freezing. Madam Pomfrey will need to see him, but he seems in no
immediate danger."
Harry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak, tucked it
around him, and clambered out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the hip flask
that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over. A thick glutinous liquid
splattered onto the office floor.
"Polyjuice Potion, Harry," said Dumbledore. "You see the simplicity of it, and the
brilliance. For Moody never does drink except from his hip flask, he's well known
for it. The imposter needed, of course, to keep the real Moody close by, so that he
could continue making the potion. You see his hair ..." Dumbledore looked down
on the Moody in the trunk. "The imposter has been cutting it off all year, see
where it is uneven? But I think, in the excitement of tonight, our fake Moody
might have forgotten to take it as frequendy as he should have done ... on the hour
. . . every hour. . . . We shall see."
Dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it, his eyes fixed
upon the unconscious Moody on the floor. Harry stared at him too. Minutes passed
in silence... .
Then, before Harry's very eyes, the face of the man on the floor began to change.
The scars were disappearing, the skin was becoming smooth; the mangled nose
became whole and started to shrink. The long mane of grizzled gray hair was
withdrawing into the scalp and turning the color of straw. Suddenly, with a loud
clunk, the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place; next moment,
the magical eyeball had popped out of the man's face as a real eye replaced it; it
440rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every direction.
Harry saw a man lying before him, pale-skinned, slightly freckled, with a mop of
fair hair. He knew who he was. He had seen him in Dumbledore's Pensieve, had
watched him being led away from court by the dementors, trying to convince Mr.
Crouch that he was innocent. . . but he was lined around the eyes now and looked
much older. . . .
There were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor. Snape had returned with
Winky at his heels. Professor McGonagall was right behind them.
"Crouch!" Snape said, stopping dead in the doorway. "Barty Crouch!"
"Good heavens," said Professor McGonagall, stopping dead and staring down at
the man on the floor.
Filthy, disheveled, Winky peered around Snape's legs. Her mouth opened wide
and she let out a piercing shriek.
"Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?"
She flung herself forward onto the young man's chest.
"You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed Master's son!"
"He is simply Stunned, Winky," said Dumbledore. "Step aside, please. Severus,
you have the potion?"
Snape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid: the
Veritaserum with which he had threatened Harry in class. Dumbledore got up,
bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position against the
wall beneath the Foe-Glass, in which the reflections of Dumbledore, Snape, and
McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all. Winky remained on her knees,
trembling, her hands over her face. Dumbledore forced the mans mouth open and
poured three drops inside it. Then he pointed his wand at the mans chest and said,
"Ennervate."
Crouch's son opened his eyes. His face was slack, his gaze unfocused.
Dumbledore knelt before him, so that their faces were level.
"Can you hear me?" Dumbledore asked quietly.
The man's eyelids flickered.
"Yes," he muttered.
"I would like you to tell us," said Dumbledore softly, "how you came to be here.
How did you escape from Azkaban?"
Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat,
expressionless voice.
441"My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded my father to
rescue me as a last favor to her. He loved her as he had never loved me. He
agreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draft of Polyjuice Potion
containing one of my mother's hairs. She took a draft of Polyjuice Potion
containing one of my hairs. We took on each other's appearance."
Winky was shaking her head, trembling.
"Say no more. Master Barty, say no more, you is getting your father into trouble!"
But Crouch took another deep breath and continued in the same flat voice.
"The dementors are blind. They sensed one healthy, one dying person entering
Azkaban. They sensed one healthy, one dying person leaving it. My father
smuggled me out, disguised as my mother, in case any prisoners were watching
through their doors.
"My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban. She was careful to drink
Polyjuice Potion until the end. She was buried under my name and bearing my
appearance. Everyone believed her to be me."
The man's eyelids flickered.
"And what did your father do with you, when he had got you home?" said
Dumbledore quietly.
"Staged my mother's death. A quiet, private funeral. That grave is empty. The
house-elf nursed me back to health. Then I had to be concealed. I had to be
controlled. My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me. When I had
recovered my strength, I thought only of finding my master . . . of returning to his
service."
"How did your father subdue you?" said Dumbledore.
"The Imperius Curse," Moody said. "I was under my fathers control. I was forced
to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night. I was always with the house-elf. She
was my keeper and caretaker. She pitied me. She persuaded my father to give me
occasional treats. Rewards for my good behavior."
"Master Barty, Master Barty," sobbed Winky through her hands. "You isn't ought
to tell them, we is getting in trouble. ..."
"Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive?" said Dumbledore softly.
"Did anyone know except your father and the house-elf?"
"Yes," said Crouch, his eyelids flickering again. "A witch in my father's office.
Bertha Jorkins. She came to the house with papers for my father s signature. He
was not at home. Winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen, to me. But
Bertha Jorkins heard Winky talking to me. She came to investigate. She heard
enough to guess who was hiding under the Invisibility Cloak. My father arrived
442home. She confronted him. He put a very powerful Memory Charm on her to
make her forget what she'd found out. Too powerful. He said it damaged her
memory permanently."
"Why is she coming to nose into my masters private business?" sobbed Winky.
"Why isn't she leaving us be?"
"Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup," said Dumbledore.
"Winky talked my father into it," said Crouch, still in the same monotonous voice.
"She spent months persuading him. I had not left the house for years. I had loved
Quidditch. Let him go, she said. He will be in his Invisibility Cloak. He can watch.
Let him smell fresh air for once. She said my mother would have wanted it. She
told my father that my mother had died to give me freedom. She had not saved me
for a life of imprisonment. He agreed in the end.
"It was carefully planned. My father led me and Winky up to the Top Box early in
the day. Winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father. I was to sit
there, invisible. When everyone had left the box, we would emerge. Winky would
appear to be alone. Nobody would ever know.
"But Winky didn't know that I was growing stronger. I was starting to fight my
father's Imperius Curse. There were times when I was almost myself again. There
were brief periods when I seemed outside his control. It happened, there, in the
Top Box. It was like waking from a deep sleep. I found myself out in public, in the
middle of the match, and I saw, in front of me, a wand sticking out of a boys
pocket. I had not been allowed a wand since before Azkaban. I stole it. Winky
didn't know. Winky is frightened of heights. She had her face hidden."
"Master Barty, you bad boy!" whispered Winky, tears trickling between her
fingers.
"So you took the wand," said Dumbledore, "and what did you do with it?"
"We went back to the tent," said Crouch. "Then we heard them. We heard the
Death Eaters. The ones who had never been to Azkaban. The ones who had never
suffered for my master. They had turned their backs on him. They were not
enslaved, as I was. They were free to seek him, but they did not. They were merely
making sport of Muggles. The sound of their voices awoke me. My mind was
clearer than it had been in years. I was angry. I had the wand.
I wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master. My father had left the
tent; he had gone to free the Muggles. Winky was afraid to see me so angry. She
used her own brand of magic to bind me to her. She pulled me from the tent,
pulled me into the forest, away from the Death Eaters. I tried to hold her back. I
wanted to return to the campsite. I wanted to show those Death Eaters what loyalty
to the Dark Lord meant, and to punish them for their lack of it. I used the stolen
wand to cast the Dark Mark into the sky.
443"Ministry wizards arrived. They shot Stunning Spells everywhere. One of the
spells came through the trees where Winky and I stood. The bond connecting us
was broken. We were both Stunned.
"When Winky was discovered, my father knew I must be nearby. He searched the
bushes where she had been found and felt me lying there. He waited until the other
Ministry members had left the forest. He put me back under the Imperius Curse
and took me home. He dismissed Winky. She had failed him. She had let me
acquire a wand. She had almost let me escape."
Winky let out a wail of despair.
"Now it was just Father and I, alone in the house. And then . . . and then . . ."
Crouch's head rolled on his neck, and an insane grin spread across his face. "My
master came for me.
"He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant Wormtail. My
master had found out that I was still alive. He had captured Bertha Jorkins in
Albania. He had tortured her. She told him a great deal. She told him about the
Triwizard Tournament. She told him the old Auror, Moody, was going to teach at
Hogwarts. He tortured her until he broke through the Memory Charm my father
had placed upon her. She told him I had escaped from Azkaban. She told him my
father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from seeking my master. And so my
master knew that I was still his faithful servant - perhaps the most faithful of all.
My master conceived a plan, based upon the information Bertha had given him.
He needed me. He arrived at our house near midnight. My father answered the
door."
The smile spread wider over Crouch's face, as though recalling the sweetest
memory of his life. Winky's petrified brown eyes were visible through her fingers.
She seemed too appalled to speak.
"It was very quick. My father was placed under the Imperius Curse by my master.
Now my father was the one imprisoned, controlled. My master forced him to go
about his business as usual, to act as though nothing was wrong. And I was
released. I awoke. I was myself again, alive as I hadn't been in years.
"And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do?" said Dumbledore.
"He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him. I was ready. It was
my dream, my greatest ambition, to serve him, to prove myself to him. He told me
he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts. A servant who would guide
Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without appearing to do so. A
servant who would watch over Harry Potter. Ensure he reached the Triwizard Cup.
Turn the cup into a Portkey, which would take the first person to touch it to my
master. But first -"
"You needed Alastor Moody," said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were blazing,
though his voice remained calm.
444"Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand. We
journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commotion. We
managed to subdue him just in time. Forced him into a compartment of his own
magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the potion. I drank it; I
became Moody's double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to face Arthur
Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a disturbance. I
made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley I had heard
intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed up Moody's
clothes and Dark detectors, put them in the trunk with Moody, and set off for
Hogwarts. I kept him alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted to be able to
question him. To find out about his past, learn his habits, so that I could fool even
Dumbledore. I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice Potion. The other
ingredients were easy. I stole boom-slang skin from the dungeons. When the
Potions master found me in his office, I said I was under orders to search it."
"And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?" said Dumbledore.
"Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my father's house, and to keep watch
over my father."
"But your father escaped," said Dumbledore.
"Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done. There
were periods when he knew what was happening. My master decided it was no
longer safe for my father to leave the house. He forced him to send letters to the
Ministry instead. He made him write and say he was ill. But Wormtail neglected
his duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped. My master guessed that
he was heading for Hogwarts. My father was going to tell Dumbledore everything,
to confess. He was going to admit that he had smuggled me from Azkaban.
"My master sent me word of my father's escape. He told me to stop him at all
costs. So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry Potter. The
map that had almost ruined everything."
"Map?" said Dumbledore quickly. "What map is this?"
"Potter's map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me stealing more
ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape's office one night. He thought I
was my father. We have the same first name. I took the map from Potter that night.
I told him my father hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my father was after
Snape.
"For a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwarts. At last, one evening, the
map showed my father entering the grounds. I pulled on my Invisibility Cloak and
went down to meet him. He was walking around the edge of the forest. Then
Potter came, and Krum. I waited. I could not hurt Potter; my master needed him.
Potter ran to get Dumbledore. I Stunned Krum. I killed my father."
"Noooo!" wailed Winky. "Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you saying?"
445"You killed your father," Dumbledore said, in the same soft voice. "What did you
do with the body?"
"Carried it into the forest. Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak. I had the map
with me. I watched Potter run into the castle. He met Snape. Dumbledore joined
them. I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the castle. I walked back out
of the forest, doubled around behind them, went to meet them. I told Dumbledore
Snape had told me where to come.
"Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father. I went back to my father's
body. Watched the map. When everyone was gone, I Transfigured my father's
body. He became a bone ... I buried it, while wearing the Invisibility Cloak, in the
freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid's cabin."
There was complete silence now, except for Winky's continued sobs. Then
Dumbledore said, "And tonight. . ."
"I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner," whispered
Barty Crouch. "Turned it into a Portkey. My master's plan worked. He is returned
to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards."
The insane smile lit his features once more, and his head drooped onto his
shoulder as Winky wailed and sobbed at his side.
446CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX - THE PARTING OF THE WAYS
Dumbledore stood up. He stared down at Barty Crouch for a moment with disgust
on his face. Then he raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it, ropes that
twisted themselves around Barty Crouch, binding him tightly. He turned to
Professor McGonagall.
"Minerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry upstairs?"
"Of course," said Professor McGonagall. She looked slightly nauseous, as though
she had just watched someone being sick. However, when she drew out her wand
and pointed it at Barty Crouch, her hand was quite steady.
"Severus" - Dumbledore turned to Snape - "please tell Madam Pomfrey to come
down here; we need to get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing. Then go down
into the grounds, find Cornelius Fudge, and bring him up to this office. He will
undoubtedly want to question Crouch himself. Tell him I will be in the hospital
wing in half an hour's time if he needs me."
Snape nodded silently and swept out of the room.
"Harry?" Dumbledore said gently.
Harry got up and swayed again; the pain in his leg, which he had not noticed all
the time he had been listening to Crouch, now returned in full measure. He also
realized that he was shaking. Dumbledore gripped his arm and helped him out into
the dark corridor.
"I want you to come up to my office first. Harry," he said quiedy as they headed
up the passageway. "Sirius is waiting for us there."
Harry nodded. A kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon
him, but he did not care; he was even glad of it. He didn't want to have to think
about anything that had happened since he had first touched the Triwizard Cup. He
didn't want to have to examine the memories, fresh and sharp as photographs,
which kept flashing across his mind. Mad-Eye Moody, inside the trunk. Wormtail,
slumped on the ground, cradling his stump of an arm. Voldemort, rising from the
steaming cauldron. Cedric. . . dead . . . Cedric, asking to be returned to his parents.
...
"Professor," Harry mumbled, "where are Mr. and Mrs. Diggory?"
"They are with Professor Sprout," said Dumbledore. His voice, which had been so
calm throughout the interrogation of Barty Crouch, shook very slightly for the first
time. "She was Head of Cedric's house, and knew him best."
They had reached the stone gargoyle. Dumbledore gave the password, it sprang
447aside, and he and Harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door.
Dumbledore pushed it open. Sirius was standing there. His face was white and
gaunt as it had been when he had escaped Azkaban. In one swift moment, he had
crossed the room.
"Harry, are you all right? I knew it - I knew something like this - what happened?"
His hands shook as he helped Harry into a chair in front of the desk.
"What happened?" he asked more urgently.
Dumbledore began to tell Sirius everything Barty Crouch had said. Harry was only
half listening. So tired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted nothing more
than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until he fell asleep and didn't
have to think or feel anymore.
There was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix had left his perch, flown
across the office, and landed on Harry's knee.
"'Lo, Fawkes," said Harry quietly. He stroked the phoenix's beautiful scarlet-and-
gold plumage. Fawkes blinked peacefully up at him. There was something
comforting about his warm weight.
Dumbledore stopped talking. He sat down opposite Harry, behind his desk. He
was looking at Harry, who avoided his eyes. Dumbledore was going to question
him. He was going to make Harry relive everything.
"I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze. Harry,"
said Dumbledore.
"We can leave that till morning, can't we, Dumbledore?" said Sirius harshly. He
had put a hand on Harrys shoulder. "Let him have a sleep. Let him rest."
Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but Dumbledore took no notice of
Sirius's words. He leaned forward toward Harry.
Very unwillingly, Harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyes.
"If I thought I could help you," Dumbledore said gently, "by putting you into an
enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have
to think about what has happened tonight, I would do it. But I know better.
Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it. You
have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you. I ask you to
demonstrate your courage one more time. I ask you to tell us what happened."
The phoenix let out one soft, quavering note. It shivered in the air, and Harry felt
as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach,
warming him, and strengthening him.
He took a deep breath and began to tell them. As he spoke, visions of everything
448that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes; he saw the sparkling
surface of the potion that had revived Voldemort; he saw the Death Eaters
Apparating between the graves around them; he saw Cedric's body, lying on the
ground beside the cup.
Once or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his hand still
tight on Harry's shoulder, but Dumbledore raised his hand to stop him, and Harry
was glad of this, because it was easier to keep going now he had started. It was
even a relief; he felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted
from him. It was costing him every bit of determination he had to keep talking, yet
he sensed that once he had finished, he would feel better.
When Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger, however, Sirius let
out a vehement exclamation and Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry
started. Dumbledore walked around the desk and told Harry to stretch out his arm.
Harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath
them.
"He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's,"
Harry told Dumbledore. "He said the protection my - my mother left in me - he'd
have it too. And he was right - he could touch me without hurting himself, he
touched my face."
For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in
Dumbledore's eyes. But next second. Harry was sure he had imagined it, for when
Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old and weary
as Harry had ever seen him.
"Very well," he said, sitting down again. "Voldemort has overcome that particular
barrier. Harry, continue, please."
Harry went on; he explained how Voldemort had emerged from the cauldron, and
told them all he could remember of Voldemort's speech to the Death Eaters. Then
he told how Voldemort had untied him, returned his wand to him, and prepared to
duel.
But when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his
and Voldemort's wands, he found his throat obstructed. He tried to keep talking,
but the memories of what had come out of Voldemort's wand were flooding into
his mind. He could see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha Jorkins ... his
father . . . his mother . . .
He was glad when Sirius broke the silence.
"The wands connected?" he said, looking from Harry to Dumbledore. "Why?"
Harry looked up at Dumbledore again, on whose face there was an arrested look.
"Priori Incantatem," he muttered.
449His eyes gazed into Harry's and it was almost as though an invisible beam of
understanding shot between them.
"The Reverse Spell effect?" said Sirius sharply.
"Exactly," said Dumbledore. "Harry's wand and Voldemorts wand share cores.
Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix. This phoenix, in
fact," he added, and he pointed at the scarlet-and-gold bird, perching peacefully on
Harry's knee.
"My wand's feather came from Fawkes?" Harry said, amazed.
"Yes," said Dumbledore. "Mr. Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the
second wand, the moment you left his shop four years ago."
"So what happens when a wand meets its brother?" said Sirius.
"They will not work properly against each other," said Dumbledore. "If, however,
the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle ... a very rare effect will take
place. One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed -
in reverse. The most recent first. . . and then those which preceded it. . . ."
He looked interrogatively at Harry, and Harry nodded.
"Which means," said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes upon Harry's face, "that some
form of Cedric must have reappeared."
Harry nodded again.
"Diggory came back to life?" said Sirius sharply.
"No spell can reawaken the dead," said Dumbledore heavily. "All that would have
happened is a kind of reverse echo. A shadow of the living Cedric would have
emerged from the wand . . . am I correct, Harry?"
"He spoke to me," Harry said. He was suddenly shaking again. "The . . . the ghost
Cedric, or whatever he was, spoke."
"An echo," said Dumbledore, "which retained Cedric's appearance and character. I
am guessing other such forms appeared . . . less recent victims of Voldemort's
wand...."
"An old man," Harry said, his throat still constricted. "Bertha Jorkins. And . . ."
"Your parents?" said Dumbledore quietly.
"Yes," said Harry.
Sirius's grip on Harry's shoulder was now so tight it was painful.
"The last murders the wand performed," said Dumbledore, nodding. "In reverse
order. More would have appeared, of course, had you maintained the connection.
450Very well, Harry, these echoes, these shadows . .. what did they do?"
Harry described how the figures that had emerged from the wand had prowled the
edges of the golden web, how Voldemort had seemed to fear them, how the
shadow of Harry's mother had told him what to do, how Cedric's had made its
final request.
At this point. Harry found he could not continue. He looked around at Sirius and
saw that he had his face in his hands.
Harry suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left his knee. The phoenix had
fluttered to the floor. It was resting its beautiful head against Harry's injured leg,
and thick, pearly tears were falling from its eyes onto the wound left by the spider.
The pain vanished. The skin mended. His leg was repaired.
"I will say it again," said Dumbledore as the phoenix rose into the air and resettled
itself upon the perch beside the door. "You have shown bravery beyond anything I
could have expected of you tonight. Harry. You have shown bravery equal to
those who died fighting Voldemort at the height of his powers. You have
shouldered a grown wizard's burden and found yourself equal to it - and you have
now given us all we have a right to expect. You will come with me to the hospital
wing. I do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight. A Sleeping Potion, and
some peace . . . Sirius, would you like to stay with him?"
Sirius nodded and stood up. He transformed back into the great black dog and
walked with Harry and Dumbledore out of the office, accompanying them down a
flight of stairs to the hospital wing.
When Dumbledore pushed open the door. Harry saw Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and
Hermione grouped around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey. They appeared to
be demanding to know where Harry was and what had happened to him. All of
them whipped around as Harry, Dumbledore, and the black dog entered, and Mrs.
Weasley let out a kind of muffled scream.
"Harry! Oh Harry!"
She started to hurry toward him, but Dumbledore moved between them.
"Molly," he said, holding up a hand, "please listen to me for a moment. Harry has
been through a terrible ordeal tonight. He has just had to relive it for me. What he
needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet. If he would like you all to stay with
him," he added, looking around at Ron, Hermione, and Bill too, "you may do so.
But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer, and certainly
not this evening."
Mrs. Weasley nodded. She was very white. She rounded on Ron, Hermione, and
Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed, "Did you hear? He needs quiet!"
"Headmaster," said Madam Pomfrey, staring at the great black dog that was Sirius,
451"may I ask what - ?"
"This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while," said Dumbledore simply. "I
assure you, he is extremely well trained. Harry - I will wait while you get into
bed."
Harry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to Dumbledore for asking the others
not to question him. It wasn't as though he didn't want them there; but the thought
of explaining it all over again, the idea of reliving it one more time, was more than
he could stand.
"I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge, Harry," said
Dumbledore. "I would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the
school." He left.
As Madam Pomfrey led Harry to a nearby bed, he caught sight of the real Moody
lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the room. His wooden leg and magical
eye were lying on the bedside table.
"Is he okay?" Harry asked.
"He'll be fine," said Madam Pomfrey, giving Harry some pajamas and pulling
screens around him. He took off his robes, pulled on the pajamas, and got into bed.
Ron, Hermione, Bill, Mrs. Weasley, and the black dog came around the screen and
settled themselves in chairs on either side of him. Ron and Hermione were looking
at him almost cautiously, as though scared of him.
"I'm all right," he told them. "Just tired."
Mrs. Weasleys eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bed-covers
unnecessarily.
Madam Pomfrey, who had bustled off to her office, returned holding a small bottle
of some purple potion and a goblet.
"You'll need to drink all of this. Harry," she said. "It's a potion for dreamless
sleep."
Harry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls. He felt himself becoming
drowsy at once. Everything around him became hazy; the lamps around the
hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen
around his bed; his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of
the feather matress. Before he could finish the potion, before he could say another
word, his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep.
Harry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn't open his eyes, wanting to
drop off again. The room was still dimly lit; he was sure it was still nighttime and
had a feeling that he couldn't have been asleep very long.
Then he heard whispering around him.
452"They'll wake him if they don't shut up!"
"What are they shouting about? Nothing else can have happened, can it?"
Harry opened his eyes blearily. Someone had removed his glasses. He could see
the fuzzy outlines of Mrs. Weasley and Bill close by. Mrs. Weasley was on her
feet.
"That's Fudge's voice," she whispered. "And that's Minerva McGonagall's, isn't it?
But what are they arguing about?"
Now Harry could hear them too: people shouting and running toward the hospital
wing.
"Regrettable, but all the same, Minerva -" Cornelius Fudge was saying loudly.
"You should never have brought it inside the castle!" yelled Professor
McGonagall. "When Dumbledore finds out -"
Harry heard the hospital doors burst open. Unnoticed by any of the people around
his bed, all of whom were staring at the door as Bill pulled back the screens, Harry
sat up and put his glasses back on.
Fudge came striding up the ward. Professors McGonagall and Snape were at his
heels.
"Where's Dumbledore?" Fudge demanded of Mrs. Weasley.
"He's not here," said Mrs. Weasley angrily. "This is a hospital wing. Minister,
don't you think you'd do better to -"
But the door opened, and Dumbledore came sweeping up the ward.
"What has happened?" said Dumbledore sharply, looking from Fudge to Professor
McGonagall. "Why are you disturbing these people? Minerva, I'm surprised at you
- I asked you to stand guard over Barty Crouch -"
"There is no need to stand guard over him anymore, Dumble-dore!" she shrieked.
"The Minister has seen to that!"
Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall lose control like this. There were
angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and a hands were balled into fists; she was
trembling with fury.-
"When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for
tonight's events," said Snape, in a low voice; he seemed to feel his personal safety
was in question. He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the
castle. He brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch -"
"I told him you would not agree, Dumbledore!" McGonagall fumed. "I told him
you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle, but -"
453"My dear woman!" roared Fudge, who likewise looked angrier than Harry had
ever seen him, "as Minister of Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring
protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous -"
But Professor McGonagall's voice drowned Fudge's.
"The moment that - that thing entered the room," she screamed, pointing at Fudge,
trembling all over, "it swooped down on Crouch and - and -"
Harry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words
to describe what had happened. He did not need her to finish her sentence. He
knew what the dementor must have done. It had administered its fatal kiss to Barty
Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his mouth. He was worse than dead.
"By all accounts, he is no loss!" blustered Fudge. "It seems he has been
responsible for several deaths'."
"But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius," said Dumbledore. He was staring
hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. "He cannot give
evidence about why he killed those people."
"Why he killed them? Well, that's no mystery, is it?" blustered Fudge. "He was a
raving lunatic! From what Minerva and Severus have told me, he seems to have
thought he was doing it all on You-Know-Who's instructions!"
"Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions, Cornelius," Dumbledore said.
"Those peoples deaths were mere by-products of a plan to restore Voldemort to
full strength again. The plan succeeded. Voldemort has been restored to his body."
Fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face.
Dazed and blinking, he stared back at Dumbledore as if he couldn't quite believe
what he had just heard. He began to sputter, still goggling at Dumbledore.
"You-Know-Who . . . returned? Preposterous. Come now, Dumbledore ..."
"As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you," said Dumbledore, "we heard
Barty Crouch confess. Under the influence of Veritaserum, he told us how he was
smuggled out of Azkaban, and how Voldemort - learning of his continued
existence from Bertha Jorkins - went to free him from his father and used him to
capture Harry. The plan worked, I tell you. Crouch has helped Voldemort to
return."
"See here, Dumbledore," said Fudge, and Harry was astonished to see a slight
smile dawning on his face, "you - you can't seriously believe that You-Know-Who
- back? Come now, come now . . . certainly, Crouch may have believed himself to
be acting upon You-Know-Who's orders - but to take the word of a lunatic like
that, Dumbledore ..."
"When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported straight to
Voldemort," said Dumbledore steadily. "He witnessed Lord Voldemort's rebirth. I
454will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office."
Dumbledore glanced around at Harry and saw that he was awake, but shook his
head and said, "I am afraid I cannot permit you to question Harry tonight."
Fudge's curious smile lingered. He too glanced at Harry, then looked back at
Dumbledore, and said, "You are - er - prepared to take Harry's word on this, are
you, Dumbledore?"
There was a moment's silence, which was broken by Sirius growling. His hackles
were raised, and he was baring his teeth at Fudge.
"Certainly, I believe Harry," said Dumbledore. His eyes were blazing now. "I
heard Crouch's confession, and I heard Harry's account of what happened after he
touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make sense, they explain everything
that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer."
Fudge still had that strange smile on his face. Once again, he glanced at Harry
before answering.
"You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, on the word of a
lunatic murderer, and a boy who . . . well..."
Fudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly understood.
"You've been reading Rita Skeeter, Mr. Fudge," he said quietly.
Ron, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and Bill all jumped. None of them had realized
that Harry was awake.
Fudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face.
"And if I have?" he said, looking at Dumbledore. "If I have discovered that you've
been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet? A Parselmouth, eh? And
having funny turns all over the place -"
"I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his
scar?" said Dumbledore coolly.
"You admit that he has been having these pains, then?" said Fudge quickly.
"Headaches? Nightmares? Possibly - hallucinations?"
"Listen to me, Cornelius," said Dumbledore, taking a step toward Fudge, and once
again, he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that Harry had felt
after Dumbledore had Stunned young Crouch. "Harry is as sane as you or I. That
scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains. I believe it hurts him when Lord
Voldemort is close by, or feeling particularly murderous."
Fudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore, but he looked no less
stubborn.
455"You'll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I've never heard of a curse scar acting as an
alarm bell before. ..."
"Look, I saw Voldemort come back!" Harry shouted. He tried to get out of bed
again, but Mrs. Weasley forced him back. "I saw the Death Eaters! I can give you
their names! Lucius Malfoy -"
Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape's eyes flew
back to Fudge.
"Malfoy was cleared!" said Fudge, visibly affronted. "A very old family -
donations to excellent causes -"
"Macnair!" Harry continued.
"Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!"
"Avery - Nott - Crabbe - Goyle -"
"You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death
Eaters thirteen years ago!" said Fudge angrily. "You could have found those
names in old reports of the trials! For heavens sake, Dumbledore - the boy was full
of some crackpot story at the end of last year too - his tales are getting taller, and
you're still swallowing them - the boy can talk to snakes. Dumbledore, and you
still think he's trustworthy?"
"You fool!" Professor McGonagall cried. "Cedric Diggory! Mr. Crouch! These
deaths were not the random work of a lunatic!"
"I see no evidence to the contrary!" shouted Fudge, now matching her anger, his
face purpling. "It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will
destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years!"
Harry couldn't believe what he was hearing. He had always thought of Fudge as a
kindly figure, a little blustering, a little pompous, but essentially good-natured. But
now a short, angry wizard stood before him, refusing, point-blank, to accept the
prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world - to believe that
Voldemort could have risen.
"Voldemort has returned," Dumbledore repeated. "If you accept that fact
straightaway. Fudge, and take the necessary measures, we may still be able to save
the situation. The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from the
control of the dementors -"
"Preposterous!" shouted Fudge again. "Remove the dementors? I'd be kicked out
of office for suggesting it! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we
know the dementors are standing guard at Azkaban!"
"The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds, Cornelius, knowing that you have
put Lord Voldemort's most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will
456join him the instant he asks them!" said Dumbledore. "They will not remain loyal
to you, Fudge! Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and
their pleasures than you can! With the dementors behind him, and his old
supporters returned to him, you will be hard-pressed to stop him regaining the sort
of power he had thirteen years ago!"
Fudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express his
outrage.
"The second step you must take - and at once," Dumbledore pressed on, "is to send
envoys to the giants."
"Envoys to the giants?" Fudge shrieked, finding his tongue again. "What madness
is this?"
"Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late," said Dumbledore,
"or Voldemort will persuade them, as he did before, that he alone among wizards
will give them their rights and their freedom!"
"You - you cannot be serious!" Fudge gasped, shaking his head and retreating
further from Dumbledore. "If the magical community got wind that I had
approached the giants - people hate them, Dumbledore - end of my career -"
"You are blinded," said Dumbledore, his voice rising now, the aura of power
around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more, "by the love of the office you
hold, Cornelius! You place too much importance, and you always have done, on
the so-called purity of blood! You fail to recognize that it matters not what
someone is born, but what they grow to be! Your dementor has just destroyed the
last remaining member of a pure-blood family as old as any - and see what that
man chose to make of his life! I tell you now- take the steps I have suggested, and
you will be remembered, in office or out, as one of the bravest and greatest
Ministers of Magic we have ever known. Fail to act - and history will remember
you as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to
destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!"
"Insane," whispered Fudge, still backing away. "Mad . . ."
And then there was silence. Madam Pomfrey was standing frozen at the foot of
Harry's bed, her hands over her mouth. Mrs.Weasley was still standing over Harry,
her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from rising. Bill, Ron, and Hermione were
staring at Fudge.
"If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this, Cornelius,"
said Dumbledore, "we have reached a parting of the ways. You must act as you
see fit. And I - I shall act as I see fit."
Dumbledore's voice carried no hint of a threat; it sounded like a mere statement,
but Fudge bristled as though Dumbledore were advancing upon him with a wand.
457"Now, see here, Dumbledore," he said, waving a threatening finger. "I've given
you free rein, always. I've had a lot of respect for you. I might not have agreed
with some of your decisions, but I've kept quiet. There aren't many who'd have let
you hire werewolves, or keep Hagrid, or decide what to teach your students
without reference to the Ministry. But if you're going to work against me -"
"The only one against whom I intend to work," said Dumbledore, "is Lord
Voldemort. If you are against him, then we remain, Cornelius, on the same side."
It seemed Fudge could think of no answer to this. He rocked backward and
forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands.
Finally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, "He can't be back, Dumbledore,
he just can't be ..."
Snape strode forward, past Dumbledore, pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as
he went. He stuck out his forearm and showed it to Fudge, who recoiled.
"There," said Snape harshly. "There. The Dark Mark. It is not as clear as it was an
hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can still see it. Every Death Eater
had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord. It was a means of distinguishing
one another, and his means of summoning us to him. When he touched the Mark
of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate, instantly, at his side.
This Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff s too. Why do you think
Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the Mark burn. We both knew he had
returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord's vengeance. He betrayed too many of his
fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold."
Fudge stepped back from Snape too. He was shaking his head. He did not seem to
have taken in a word Snape had said. He stared, apparently repelled by the ugly
mark on Snape's arm, then looked up at Dumbledore and whispered, "I don't know
what you and your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have heard enough. I
have no more to add. I will be in touch with you tomorrow, Dumbledore, to
discuss the running of this school. I must return to the Ministry."
He had almost reached the door when he paused. He turned around, strode back
down the dormitory, and stopped at Harry's bed.
"Your winnings," he said shortly, taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket and
dropping it onto Harrys bedside table. "One thousand Galleons. There should have
been a presentation ceremony, but under the circumstances .. ."
He crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the room, slamming
the door behind him. The moment he had disappeared, Dumbledore turned to look
at the group around Harry's bed.
"There is work to be done," he said. "Molly... am I right in thinking that I can
count on you and Arthur?"
"Of course you can," said Mrs. Weasley. She was white to the lips, but she looked
458resolute. "We know what Fudge is. It's Arthur's fondness for Muggles that has
held him back at the Ministry all these years. Fudge thinks he lacks proper
wizarding pride."
"Then I need to send a message to Arthur," said Dumbledore. "All those that we
can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately, and he is well placed to
contact those at the Ministry who are not as shortsighted as Cornelius."
"I'll go to Dad," said Bill, standing up. "I'll go now."
"Excellent," said Dumbledore. "Tell him what has happened. Tell him I will be in
direct contact with him shortly. He will need to be discreet, however. If Fudge
thinks I am interfering at the Ministry -"
"Leave it to me," said Bill.
He clapped a hand on Harry's shoulder, kissed his mother on the cheek, pulled on
his cloak, and strode quickly from the room.
"Minerva," said Dumbledore, turning to Professor McGonagall, "I want to see
Hagrid in my office as soon as possible. Also - if she will consent to come -
Madame Maxime."
Professor McGonagall nodded and left without a word.
"Poppy," Dumbledore said to Madam Pomfrey, "would you be very kind and go
down to Professor Moodys office, where I think you will find a house-elf called
Winky in considerable distress? Do what you can for her, and take her back to the
kitchens. I think Dobby will look after her for us."
"Very - very well," said Madam Pomfrey, looking startled, and she too left.
Dumbledore made sure that the door was closed, and that Madam Pomfrey's
footsteps had died away, before he spoke again.
"And now," he said, "it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for
what they are. Sirius ... if you could resume your usual form."
The great black dog looked up at Dumbledore, then, in an instant, turned back into
a man.
Mrs. Weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed.
"Sirius Black!" she shrieked, pointing at him.
"Mum, shut up!" Ron yelled. "It's okay!"
Snape had not yelled or jumped backward, but the look on his face was one of
mingled fury and horror.
"Him!" he snarled, staring at Sirius, whose face showed equal dislike. "What is he
459doing here?"
"He is here at my invitation," said Dumbledore, looking between them, "as are
you, Severus. I trust you both. It is time for you to lay aside your old differences
and trust each other."
Harry thought Dumbledore was asking for a near miracle. Sirius and Snape were
eyeing each other with the utmost loathing.
"I will settle, in the short term," said Dumbledore, with a bite of impatience in his
voice, "for a lack of open hostility. You will shake hands. You are on the same
side now. Time is short, and unless the few of us who know the truth do not stand
united, there is no hope
for any us.
Very slowly - but still glaring at each other as though each wished the other
nothing but ill - Sirius and Snape moved toward each other and shook hands. They
let go extremely quickly.
"That will do to be going on with," said Dumbledore, stepping between them once
more. "Now I have work for each of you. Fudge's attitude, though not unexpected,
changes everything. Sirius, I need you to set off at once. You are to alert Remus
Lupin, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher - the old crowd. Lie low at Lupin's for
a while; I will contact you there."
"But -" said Harry.
He wanted Sirius to stay. He did not want to have to say goodbye again so quickly.
"You'll see me very soon. Harry," said Sirius, turning to him. "I promise you. But I
must do what I can, you understand, don't you?"
"Yeah," said Harry. "Yeah . . . of course I do."
Sirius grasped his hand briefly, nodded to Dumbledore, transformed again into the
black dog, and ran the length of the room to the door, whose handle he turned with
a paw. Then he was gone.
"Severus," said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, "you know what I must ask you to
do. If you are ready . . . if you are prepared ..."
"I am," said Snape.
He looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold, black eyes glittered strangely.
"Then good luck," said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a trace of apprehension
on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after Sirius.
It was several minutes before Dumbledore spoke again.
460"I must go downstairs," he said finally. "I must see the Diggorys. Harry - take the
rest of your potion. I will see all of you later."
Harry slumped back against his pillows as Dumbledore disappeared. Hermione,
Ron, and Mrs. Weasley were all looking at him. None of them spoke for a very
long time.
"You've got to take the rest of your potion. Harry," Mrs. Weasley said at last. Her
hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle
and the goblet. "You have a good long sleep. Try and think about something else
for a while . . . think about what you're going to buy with your winnings!"
"I don't want that gold," said Harry in an expressionless voice. "You have it.
Anyone can have it. I shouldn't have won it. It should've been Cedric's."
The thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come
out of the maze was threatening to overpower him. He could feel a burning,
prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes. He blinked and stared up at the
ceiling.
"It wasn't your fault. Harry," Mrs. Weasley whispered.
"I told him to take the cup with me," said Harry.
Now the burning feeling was in his throat too. He wished Ron would look away.
Mrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her
arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though
by a mother. The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in
upon him as Mrs. Weasley held him to her. His mother s face, his father's voice,
the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground all started spinning in his head until he
could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery
fighting to get out of him.
There was a loud slamming noise, and Mrs. Weasley and Harry broke apart.
Hermione was standing by the window. She was holding something tight in her
hand.
"Sorry," she whispered.
"Your potion, Harry," said Mrs. Weasley quickly, wiping her eyes on the back of
her hand.
Harry drank it in one gulp. The effect was instantaneous. Heavy, irresistible waves
of dreamless sleep broke over him; he fell back onto his pillows and thought no
more.
461CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN - THE BEGINNING
When he looked back, even a month later, Harry found he had only scattered
memories of the next few days. It was as though he had been through too much to
take in any more. The recollections he did have were very painful. The worst,
perhaps, was the meeting with the Diggorys that took place the following morning.
They did not blame him for what had happened; on the contrary, both thanked him
for returning Cedric's body to them. Mr. Diggory sobbed through most of the
interview. Mrs. Diggory's grief seemed to be beyond tears.
"He suffered very little then," she said, when Harry had told her how Cedric had
died. "And after all, Amos ... he died just when he'd won the tournament. He must
have been happy."
When they got to their feet, she looked down at Harry and said, "You look after
yourself, now."
Harry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table.
"You take this," he muttered to her. "It should've been Cedric's, he got there first,
you take it -"
But she backed away from him.
"Oh no, it's yours, dear, I couldn't. . . you keep it."
Harry returned to Gryffindor Tower the following evening. From what Hermione
and Ron told him, Dumbledore had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast.
He had merely requested that they leave Harry alone, that nobody ask him
questions or badger him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze. Most
people, he noticed, were skirting him in the corridors, avoiding his eyes. Some
whispered behind their hands as he passed. He guessed that many of them had
believed Rita Skeeter's article about how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was.
Perhaps they were formulating their own theories about how Cedric had died. He
found he didn't care very much. He liked it best when he was with Ron and
Hermione and they were talking about other things, or else letting him sit in
silence while they played chess. He felt as though all three of them had reached an
understanding they didn't need to put into words; that each was waiting for some
sign, some word, of what was going on outside Hogwarts - and that it was useless
to speculate about what might be coming until they knew anything for certain. The
only time they touched upon the subject was when Ron told Harry about a meeting
Mrs. Weasley had had with Dumbledore before going home.
"She went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer," he said. "But
he wants you to go back to the Dursleys, at least at first."
462"Why?" said Harry.
"She said Dumbledore's got his reasons," said Ron, shaking his head darkly. "I
suppose we've got to trust him, haven't we?"
The only person apart from Ron and Hermione that Harry felt able to talk to was
Hagrid. As there was no longer a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, they had
those lessons free. They used the one on Thursday afternoon to go down and visit
Hagrid in his cabin. It was a bright and sunny day; Fang bounded out of the open
door as they approached, barking and wagging his tail madly.
"Who's that?" called Hagrid, coming to the door. "Harry!"
He strode out to meet them, pulled Harry into a one-armed hug, ruffled his hair,
and said, "Good ter see yeh, mate. Good ter see yeh."
They saw two bucket-size cups and saucers on the wooden table in front of the
fireplace when they entered Hagrid's cabin.
"Bin havin' a cuppa with Olympe," Hagrid said. "She's jus' left."
"Who?" said Ron curiously.
"Madame Maxime, o' course!" said Hagrid.
"You two made up, have you?" said Ron.
"Dunno what yeh're talkin' about," said Hagrid airily, fetching more cups from the
dresser. When he had made tea and offered around a plate of doughy cookies, he
leaned back in his chair and surveyed Harry closely through his beetle-black eyes.
"You all righ'?" he said gruffly
"Yeah," said Harry.
"No, yeh're not," said Hagrid. "Course yeh're not. But yeh will be."
Harry said nothing.
"Knew he was goin' ter come back," said Hagrid, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione
looked up at him, shocked. "Known it fer years. Harry. Knew he was out there,
bidin' his time. It had ter happen. Well, now it has, an' we'll jus' have ter get on
with it. We'll fight. Migh' be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold. That's
Dumbledores plan, anyway. Great man, Dumbledore. 'S long as we've got him, I'm
not too worried."
Hagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving expressions on their faces.
"No good sittin' worryin' abou' it," he said. "What's comin' will come, an we'll
meet it when it does. Dumbledore told me wha' you did. Harry."
Hagrid's chest swelled as he looked at Harry.
463"Yeh did as much as yer father would've done, an' I can' give yeh no higher praise
than that."
Harry smiled back at him. It was the first time he'd smiled in days. "What's
Dumbledore asked you to do, Hagrid?" he asked. "He sent Professor McGonagall
to ask you and Madame Maxime to meet him - that night."
"Got a little job fer me over the summer," said Hagrid. "Secret, though. I'm not
s'pposed ter talk abou' it, no, not even ter you lot. Olympe - Madame Maxime ter
you - might be comin' with me. I think she will. Think I got her persuaded."
"Is it to do with Voldemort?"
Hagrid flinched at the sound of the name.
"Migh' be," he said evasively. "Now . . . who'd like ter come an' visit the las'
skrewt with me? I was jokin' - jokin'!" he added hastily, seeing the looks on their
faces.
It was with a heavy heart that Harry packed his trunk up in the dormitory on the
night before his return to Privet Drive. He was dreading the Leaving Feast, which
was usually a cause for celebration, when the winner of the Inter-House
Championship would be announced. He had avoided being in the Great Hall when
it was full ever since he had left the hospital wing, preferring to eat when it was
nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow students.
When he, Ron, and Hermione entered the Hall, they saw at once that the usual
decorations were missing. The Great Hall was normally decorated with the
winning House's colors for the Leaving Feast. Tonight, however, there were black
drapes on the wall behind the teachers' table. Harry knew instantly that they were
there as a mark of respect to Cedric.
The real Mad-Eye Moody was at the staff table now, his wooden leg and his
magical eye back in place. He was extremely twitchy, jumping every time
someone spoke to him. Harry couldn't blame him; Moodys fear of attack was
bound to have been increased by his ten-month imprisonment in his own trunk.
Professor Karkaroff s chair was empty. Harry wondered, as he sat down with the
other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff was now, and whether Voldemort had caught
up with him.
Madame Maxime was still there. She was sitting next to Hagrid. They were
talking quietly together. Further along the table, sitting next to Professor
McGonagall, was Snape. His eyes lingered on Harry for a moment as Harry
looked at him. His expression was difficult to read. He looked as sour and
unpleasant as ever. Harry continued to watch him, long after Snape had looked
away.
What was it that Snape had done on Dumbledores orders, the night that Voldemort
had returned? And why. . . why . . . was Dumbledore so convinced that Snape was
464truly on their side? He had been their spy, Dumbledore had said so in the
Pensieve. Snape had turned spy against Voldemort, "at great personal risk." Was
that the job he had taken up again? Had he made contact with the Death Eaters,
perhaps? Pretended that he had never really gone over to Dumbledore, that he had
been, like Voldemort himself, biding his time?
Harry's musings were ended by Professor Dumbledore, who stood up at the staff
table. The Great Hall, which in any case had been less noisy than it usually was at
the Leaving Feast, became very quiet.
"The end," said Dumbledore, looking around at them all, "of another year."
He paused, and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff table. Theirs had been the most
subdued table before he had gotten to his feet, and theirs were still the saddest and
palest faces in the Hall.
"There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight," said Dumbledore, "but I
must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who should be sitting here,"
he gestured toward the Hufflepuffs, "enjoying our feast with us. I would like you
all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory."
They did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the Hall stood, and
raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, "Cedric
Diggory."
Harry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd. There were tears pouring
silently down her face. He looked down at the table as they all sat down again.
"Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish
Hufflepuff house," Dumbledore continued. "He was a good and loyal friend, a
hard worker, he valued fair play. His death has affected you all, whether you knew
him well or not. I think that you have the right, therefore, to know exactly how it
came about."
Harry raised his head and stared at Dumbledore.
"Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort."
A panicked whisper swept the Great Hall. People were staring at Dumbledore in
disbelief, in horror. He looked perfectly calm as he watched them mutter
themselves into silence.
"The Ministry of Magic," Dumbledore continued, "does not wish me to tell you
this. It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so -
either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, or because
they think I should not tell you so, young as you are. It is my belief, however, that
the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric
died as the result of an accident, or some sort of blunder of his own, is an insult to
his memory."
465Stunned and frightened, every face in the Hall was turned toward Dumbledore
now... or almost every face. Over at the Slytherin table. Harry saw Draco Malfoy
muttering something to Crabbe and Goyle. Harry felt a hot, sick swoop of anger in
his stomach. He forced himself to look back at Dumbledore.
"There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with Cedrics
death," Dumbledore went on. "I am talking, of course, about Harry Potter."
A kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads turned in Harry's direction
before flicking back to face Dumbledore.
"Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort," said Dumbledore. "He risked
his own life to return Cedric's body to Hogwarts. He showed, in every respect, the
sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort, and
for this, I honor him."
Dumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his goblet once more. Nearly
everyone in the Great Hall followed suit. They murmured his name, as they had
murmured Cedric's, and drank to him. But through a gap in the standing figures.
Harry saw that Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and many of the other Slytherins had
remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched. Dumbledore, who after
all possessed no magical eye, did not see them.
When everyone had once again resumed their seats, Dumbledore continued, "The
Triwizard Tournament's aim was to further and promote magical understanding. In
the light of what has happened - of Lord Voldemorts return - such ties are more
important than ever before."
Dumbledore looked from Madame Maxime and Hagrid, to Fleur Delacour and her
fellow Beauxbatons students, to Viktor Krum and the Durmstrangs at the Slytherin
table. Krum, Harry saw, looked wary, almost frightened, as though he expected
Dumbledore to say something harsh.
"Every guest in this Hall," said Dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the
Durmstrang students, "will be welcomed back here at any time, should they wish
to come. I say to you all, once again - in the light of Lord Voldemort's return, we
are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. Lord Voldemorts
gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by
showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of habit and
language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.
"It is my belief- and never have I so hoped that I am mistaken - that we are all
facing dark and difficult times. Some of you in this Hall have already suffered
directly at the hands of Lord Voldemort. Many of your families have been torn
asunder. A week ago, a student was taken from our midst.
"Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a
choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy
who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord
466Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory."
Harry's trunk was packed; Hedwig was back in her cage on top of it. He, Ron, and
Hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth
years for the carriages that would take them back to Hogsmeade station. It was
another beautiful summer's day. He supposed that Privet Drive would be hot and
leafy, its flower beds a riot of color, when he arrived there that evening. The
thought gave him no pleasure at all.
"'Arry!"
He looked around. Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle.
Beyond her, far across the grounds. Harry could see Hagrid helping Madame
Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness. The Beauxbatons
carriage was about to take off.
"We will see each uzzer again, I 'ope," said Fleur as she reached him, holding out
her hand. "I am 'oping to get a job 'ere, to improve my Eenglish."
"It's very good already," said Ron in a strangled sort of voice. Fleur smiled at him;
Hermione scowled.
"Good-bye, 'Arry," said Fleur, turning to go. "It 'az been a pleasure meeting you!"
Harrys spirits couldn't help but lift slightly as he watched Fleur hurry back across
the lawns to Madame Maxime, her silvery hair rippling in the sunlight.
Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back," said Ron. "D' you reckon
they can steer that ship without Karkaroff?"
"Karkaroff did not steer," said a gruff voice. "He stayed in his cabin and let us do
the vork."
Krum had come to say good-bye to Hermione. "Could I have a vord?" he asked
her.
"Oh . . . yes ... all right," said Hermione, looking slightly flustered, and following
Krum through the crowd and out of sight.
"You'd better hurry up!" Ron called loudly after her. "The carriages'll be here in a
minute!"
He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next few
minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and Hermione
might be up to. They returned quite soon. Ron stared at Hermione, but her face
was quite impassive.
"I liked Diggory," said Krum abruptly to Harry. "He vos alvays polite to me.
Alvays. Even though I vos from Durmstrang - with Karkaroff," he added,
scowling.
467"Have you got a new headmaster yet?" said Harry
Krum shrugged. He held out his hand as Fleur had done, shook Harry's hand, and
then Ron's. Ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of painful internal
struggle. Krum had already started walking away when Ron burst out, "Can I have
your autograph?"
Hermione turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages that were now trundling
toward them up the drive, as Krum, looking surprised but gratified, signed a
fragment of parchment for Ron.
The weather could not have been more different on the journey back to King's
Cross than it had been on their way to Hogwarts the previous September. There
wasn't a single cloud in the sky. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had managed to get a
compartment to themselves. Pigwidgeon was once again hidden under Rons dress
robes to stop him from hooting continually; Hedwig was dozing, her head under
her wing, and Crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat like a large, furry ginger
cushion. Harry, Ron, and Hermione talked more fully and freely than they had all
week as the train sped them southward. Harry felt as though Dumbledore's speech
at the Leaving Feast had unblocked him, somehow. It was less painful to discuss
what had happened now. They broke off their conversation about what action
Dumbledore might be taking, even now, to stop Voldemort only when the lunch
trolley arrived.
When Hermione returned from the trolley and put her money back into her
schoolbag, she dislodged a copy of the Daily Prophet that she had been carrying in
there. Harry looked at it, unsure whether he really wanted to know what it might
say, but Hermione, seeing him looking at it, said calmly, "There's nothing in there.
You can look for yourself, but there's nothing at all. I've been checking every day.
Just a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament. They
didn't even mention Cedric. Nothing about any of it. If you ask me. Fudge is
forcing them to keep quiet."
"He'll never keep Rita quiet," said Harry. "Not on a story like this."
"Oh, Rita hasn't written anything at all since the third task," said Hermione in an
oddly constrained voice. "As a matter of fact," she added, her voice now trembling
slightly, "Rita Skeeter isn't going to be writing anything at all for a while. Not
unless she wants me to spill the beans on her."
"What are you talking about?" said Ron.
"I found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she wasn't
supposed to be coming onto the grounds," said Hermione in a rush.
Harry had the impression that Hermione had been dying to tell them this for days,
but that she had restrained herself in light of everything else that had happened.
"How was she doing it?" said Harry at once.
468"How did you find out?" said Ron, staring at her.
"Well, it was you, really, who gave me the idea. Harry," she said.
"Did I?" said Harry, perplexed. "How?"
"Bugging," said Hermione happily.
"But you said they didn't work -"
"Oh not electronic bugs," said Hermione. "No, you see ... Rita Skeeter" -
Hermiones voice trembled with quiet triumph - "is an unregistered Animagus. She
can turn -"
Hermione pulled a small sealed glass jar out other bag.
"- into a beetle."
"You're kidding," said Ron. "You haven't.. . she's not..."
"Oh yes she is," said Hermione happily, brandishing the jar at them.
Inside were a few twigs and leaves and one large, fat beetle.
"That's never - you're kidding -" Ron whispered, lifting the jar to his eyes.
"No, I'm not," said Hermione, beaming. "I caught her on the windowsill in the
hospital wing. Look very closely, and you'll notice the markings around her
antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears."
Harry looked and saw that she was quite right. He also remembered something.
"There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Hagrid telling Madame
Maxime about his mum!"
"Exactly," said Hermione. "And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after we'd
had our conversation by the lake. And unless I'm very much mistaken, Rita was
perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the day your scar hurt. She's
been buzzing around for stories all year."
"When we saw Malfoy under that tree ..." said Ron slowly.
"He was talking to her, in his hand," said Hermione. "He knew, of course. That's
how she's been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins. They
wouldn't care that she was doing something illegal, as long as they were giving her
horrible stuff about us and Hagrid."
Hermione took the glass jar back from Ron and smiled at the beetle, which buzzed
angrily against the glass.
"I've told her I'll let her out when we get back to London," said Hermione. "I've
put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar, you see, so she can't transform. And I've
469told her she's to keep her quill to herself for a whole year. See if she can't break the
habit of writing horrible lies about people."
Smiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag.
The door of the compartment slid open.
"Very clever. Granger," said Draco Malfoy.
Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him. All three of them looked more
pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more menacing, than Harry had ever
seen them.
"So," said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment and looking
slowly around at them, a smirk quivering on his lips. "You caught some pathetic
reporter, and Potter's Dumbledore's favorite boy again. Big deal."
His smirk widened. Crabbe and Goyle leered.
"Trying not to think about it, are we?" said Malfoy softly, looking around at all
three of them. "Trying to pretend it hasn't happened?"
"Get out," said Harry.
He had not been this close to Malfoy since he had watched him muttering to
Crabbe and Goyle during Dumbledores speech about Cedric. He could feel a kind
of ringing in his ears. His hand gripped his wand under his robes.
"You've picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you you ought to
choose your company more carefully, remember? When we met on the train, first
day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this!" He jerked
his head at Ron and Hermione. "Too late now. Potter! They'll be the first to go,
now the Dark Lord's back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first! Well - second -
Diggory was the f-"
It was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the
compartment. Blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every
direction, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry blinked and looked down at the
floor.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway. He, Ron,
and Hermione were on their feet, all three of them having used a different hex.
Nor were they the only ones to have done so.
"Thought we'd see what those three were up to," said Fred matter-of-factly,
stepping onto Goyle and into the compartment. He had his wand out, and so did
George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside.
"Interesting effect," said George, looking down at Crabbe. "Who used the
Furnunculus Curse?"
470"Me," said Harry.
"Odd," said George lightly. "I used Jelly-Legs. Looks as though those two
shouldn't be mixed. He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face.
Well, let's not leave them here, they don't add much to the decor."
Ron, Harry, and George kicked, rolled, and pushed the unconscious Malfoy,
Crabbe, and Goyle - each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of
jinxes with which they had been hit - out into the corridor, then came back into the
compartment and rolled the door shut.
"Exploding Snap, anyone?" said Fred, pulling out a pack of cards.
They were halfway through their fifth game when Harry decided to ask them.
"You going to tell us, then?" he said to George. "Who you were blackmailing?"
"Oh," said George darkly. "That."
"It doesn't matter," said Fred, shaking his head impatiently. "It wasn't anything
important. Not now, anyway."
"We've given up," said George, shrugging.
But Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept on asking, and finally, Fred said, "All right,
all right, if you really want to know ... it was Ludo Bagman."
"Bagman?" said Harry sharply. "Are you saying he was involved in -"
"Nah," said George gloomily. "Nothing like that. Stupid git. He wouldn't have the
brains."
"Well, what, then?" said Ron.
Fred hesitated, then said, "You remember that bet we had with him at the
Quidditch World Cup? About how Ireland would win, but Krum would get the
Snitch?"
"Yeah," said Harry and Ron slowly.
"Well, the git paid us in leprechaun gold he'd caught from the Irish mascots."
"So?"
"So," said Fred impatiently, "it vanished, didn't it? By next morning, it had gone!"
"But - it must've been an accident, mustn't it?" said Hermione.
George laughed very bitterly.
"Yeah, that's what we thought, at first. We thought if we just wrote to him, and
told him he'd made a mistake, he'd cough up. But nothing doing. Ignored our
471letter. We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts, but he was always
making some excuse to get away from us."
"In the end, he turned pretty nasty," said Fred. "Told us we were too young to
gamble, and he wasn't giving us anything."
"So we asked for our money back," said George glowering.
"He didn't refuse!" gasped Hermione.
"Right in one," said Fred.
"But that was all your savings!" said Ron.
"Tell me about it," said George. "'Course, we found out what was going on in the
end. Lee Jordan's dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as well.
Turns out he's in big trouble with the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off them. A
gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold
he had, and it still wasn't enough to cover all his debts. They followed him all the
way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He's lost everything gambling. Hasn't got
two Galleons to rub together. And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins
back?"
"How?" said Harry.
"He put a bet on you, mate," said Fred. "Put a big bet on you to win the
tournament. Bet against the goblins."
"So that's why he kept trying to help me win!" said Harry. "Well - I did win, didn't
I? So he can pay you your gold!"
"Nope," said George, shaking his head. "The goblins play as dirty as him. They
say you drew with Diggory, and Bagman was betting you'd win outright. So
Bagman had to run for it. He did run for it right after the third task."
George sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again.
The rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry wished it could have gone
on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at King's Cross . . . but as he
had learned the hard way that year, time will not slow down when something
unpleasant lies ahead, and all too soon, the Hogwarts Express was pulling in at
platform nine and three-quarters. The usual confusion and noise filled the
corridors as the students began to disembark. Ron and Hermione struggled out
past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying their trunks. Harry, however, stayed put.
"Fred - George - wait a moment."
The twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his Triwizard
winnings.
"Take it," he said, and he thrust the sack into George's hands.
472"What?" said Fred, looking flabbergasted.
"Take it," Harry repeated firmly. "I don't want it."
"You're mental," said George, trying to push it back at Harry.
"No, I'm not," said Harry. "You take it, and get inventing. It's for the joke shop."
"He is mental," Fred said in an almost awed voice.
"Listen," said Harry firmly. "If you don't take it, I'm throwing it down the drain. I
don't want it and I don't need it. But I could do with a few laughs. We could all do
with a few laughs. I've got a feeling we're going to need them more than usual
before long."
"Harry," said George weakly, weighing the money bag in his hands, "there's got to
be a thousand Galleons in here."
"Yeah," said Harry, grinning. "Think how many Canary Creams that is."
The twins stared at him.
"Just don't tell your mum where you got it... although she might not be so keen for
you to join the Ministry anymore, come to think of it. . . ."
"Harry," Fred began, but Harry pulled out his wand.
"Look," he said flatly, "take it, or I'll hex you. I know some good ones now. Just
do me one favor, okay? Buy Ron some different dress robes and say they're from
you."
He left the compartment before they could say another word, stepping over
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex
marks.
Uncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier. Mrs. Weasley was close by him.
She hugged Harry very tightly when she saw him and whispered in his ear, "I
think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer. Keep in touch,
Harry."
"See you. Harry," said Ron, clapping him on the back.
"'Bye, Harry!" said Hermione, and she did something she had never done before,
and kissed him on the cheek.
"Harry - thanks," George muttered, while Fred nodded fervently at his side.
Harry winked at them, turned to Uncle Vernon, and followed him silently from the
station. There was no point worrying yet, he told himself, as he got into the back
of the Dursleys' car.
473As Hagrid had said, what would come, would come ... and he would have to meet
it when it did.

And the Order OF PhoenixCHAPTER ONE
DUDLEY DEMENTED
T
he hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and
a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet
Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and
lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; the use
of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual
car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet
Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows
thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The
only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his
back in a flower bed outside number four.
He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the
pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a
short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy
and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the up-
pers. Harry Potter’s appearance did not endear him to the neighbors,
who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be pun-
ishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea
bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby. In fact, the only

1
CHAPTER ONE
way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia
stuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight
down into the flower bed below.
On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his
idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on
the hot, hard earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at
him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or
shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had
tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with his
aunt and uncle.
Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open win-
dow, Vernon Dursley, Harry’s uncle, suddenly spoke. “Glad to see the
boy’s stopped trying to butt in. Where is he anyway?”
“I don’t know,” said Aunt Petunia unconcernedly. “Not in the
house.”
Uncle Vernon grunted.
“Watching the news . . .” he said scathingly. “I’d like to know what
he’s really up to. As if a normal boy cares what’s on the news — Dud-
ley hasn’t got a clue what’s going on, doubt he knows who the Prime
Minister is! Anyway, it’s not as if there’d be anything about his lot on
our news —”
“Vernon, shh!” said Aunt Petunia. “The window’s open!”
“Oh — yes — sorry, dear . . .”
The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit ’N
Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-loving
old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was
frowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased that he was
concealed behind the bush; Mrs. Figg had recently taken to asking
him around for tea whenever she met him in the street. She had
rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon’s
voice floated out of the window again.

2
DUDLEY DEMENTED
“Dudders out for tea?”
“At the Polkisses’,” said Aunt Petunia fondly. “He’s got so many lit-
tle friends, he’s so popular . . .”
Harry repressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were as-
tonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley; they had swallowed all his
dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang
every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that
Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every
evening vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, and
throwing stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen them at
it during his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent
most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers
from bins along the way.
The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o’clock
news reached Harry’s ears and his stomach turned over. Perhaps
tonight — after a month of waiting — would be the night —
“Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the
Spanish baggage-handlers’ strike reaches its second week —”
“Give ’em a lifelong siesta, I would,” snarled Uncle Vernon over the
end of the newsreader’s sentence, but no matter: Outside in the flower
bed, Harry’s stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had happened,
it would surely have been the first item on the news; death and de-
struction were more important than stranded holidaymakers. . . .
He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky.
Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expecta-
tion, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again . . . and
always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why noth-
ing had happened yet. . . .
He kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not rec-
ognized for what it really was by the Muggles — an unexplained
disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident . . . but the

3
CHAPTER ONE
baggage-handlers’ strike was followed by news on the drought in the
Southeast (“I hope he’s listening next door!” bellowed Uncle Vernon,
“with his sprinklers on at three in the morning!”); then a helicopter
that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress’s di-
vorce from her famous husband (“as if we’re interested in their sordid
affairs,” sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively
in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on).
Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the
newsreader said, “And finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel
way of keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feath-
ers in Barnsley, has learned to water-ski! Mary Dorkins went to find
out more. . . .”
Harry opened his eyes again. If they had reached water-skiing
budgerigars, there was nothing else worth hearing. He rolled cau-
tiously onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows,
preparing to crawl out from under the window.
He had moved about two inches when several things happened in
very quick succession.
A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat
streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a
bellowed oath, and the sound of breaking china came from the Durs-
leys’ living room, and as though Harry had been waiting for this
signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waist-
band of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a
sword. But before he could draw himself up to full height, the top of
his head collided with the Dursleys’ open window, and the resultant
crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder.
Harry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes streaming, he
swayed, trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise,
but he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple
hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around
his throat.


DUDLEY DEMENTED
“Put — it — away!” Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry’s ear. “Now!
Before — anyone — sees!”
“Get — off — me!” Harry gasped; for a few seconds they strug-
gled, Harry pulling at his uncle’s sausage-like fingers with his left
hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand. Then, as
the pain in the top of Harry’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, Un-
cle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an
electric shock — some invisible force seemed to have surged through
his nephew, making him impossible to hold.
Panting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, straightened
up, and stared around. There was no sign of what had caused the loud
cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various
nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans
and tried to look innocent.
“Lovely evening!” shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs. Number
Seven, who was glaring from behind her net curtains. “Did you hear
that car backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!”
He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious
neighbors had disappeared from their various windows, then the grin
became a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back toward him.
Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the
point at which Uncle Vernon’s outstretched hands could resume their
strangling.
“What the devil do you mean by it, boy?” asked Uncle Vernon in a
croaky voice that trembled with fury.
“What do I mean by what?” said Harry coldly. He kept looking left
and right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made
the cracking noise.
“Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our —”
“I didn’t make that noise,” said Harry firmly.
Aunt Petunia’s thin, horsey face now appeared beside Uncle Ver-
non’s wide, purple one. She looked livid.

5
CHAPTER ONE
“Why were you lurking under our window?”
“Yes — yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our
window, boy?”
“Listening to the news,” said Harry in a resigned voice.
His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.
“Listening to the news! Again?”
“Well, it changes every day, you see,” said Harry.
“Don’t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what you’re re-
ally up to — and don’t give me any more of this listening to the news
tosh! You know perfectly well that your lot . . .”
“Careful, Vernon!” breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon low-
ered his voice so that Harry could barely hear him, “. . . that your lot
don’t get on our news!”
“That’s all you know,” said Harry.
The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia
said, “You’re a nasty little liar. What are all those —” she too lowered
her voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word, “— owls —
doing if they’re not bringing you news?”
“Aha!” said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. “Get out of that
one, boy! As if we didn’t know you get all your news from those pesti-
lential birds!”
Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something to tell the
truth this time, even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly
know how bad Harry felt at admitting it.
“The owls . . . aren’t bringing me news,” said Harry tonelessly.
“I don’t believe it,” said Aunt Petunia at once.
“No more do I,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully.
“We know you’re up to something funny,” said Aunt Petunia.
“We’re not stupid, you know,” said Uncle Vernon.
“Well, that’s news to me,” said Harry, his temper rising, and before
the Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the

6
DUDLEY DEMENTED
front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off up
the street.
He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have to face his
aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he did not
care very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing mat-
ters on his mind.
Harry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone
Apparating or Disapparating. It was exactly the sound Dobby the
house-elf made when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that
Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following him right
at this very moment? As this thought occurred he wheeled around and
stared back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely de-
serted again and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to
become invisible. . . .
He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was taking, for he had
pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his fa-
vorite haunts automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over his
shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt
Petunias dying begonias, he was sure of it. Why hadn’t they spoken to
him, why hadn’t they made contact, why were they hiding now?
And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his certainty leaked
away.
Perhaps it hadn’t been a magical sound after all. Perhaps he was so
desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he
belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises.
Could he be sure it hadn’t been the sound of something breaking in-
side a neighbor’s house?
Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach and, before he
knew it, the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer
rolled over him once again. . . .
Tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at five

7
CHAPTER ONE
o’clock so that he could pay the owl that delivered the Daily
Prophet — but was there any point in continuing to take it? Harry
merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days;
when the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that Voldemort was
back it would be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry
cared about.
If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his
best friends, Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he had had
that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed.
“We can’t say much about you-know-what, obviously. . . .” “We’ve been
told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray. . . .”
“We’re quite busy but I can’t give you details here. . . .” “There’s a fair
amount going on, we’ll tell you everything when we see you. . . .”
But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed too both-
ered with a precise date. Hermione had scribbled, “I expect we’ll be see-
ing you quite soon” inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As
far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione
and Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron’s parents’ house.
He could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the
Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he was so angry at
them that he had thrown both their birthday presents of Honeydukes
chocolates away unopened, though he had regretted this after eating
the wilting salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night.
And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasn’t he,
Harry, busy? Hadn’t he proved himself capable of handling much
more than they? Had they all forgotten what he had done? Hadn’t it
been he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being
murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed . . . ?
Don’t think about that, Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth
time that summer. It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the grave-
yard in his nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking moments
too.


DUDLEY DEMENTED
He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he
passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had
first clapped eyes on his godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to under-
stand how Harry was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as empty
of proper news as Ron and Hermione’s, but at least they contained
words of caution and consolation instead of tantalizing hints:
“I know this must be frustrating for you. . . .” “Keep your nose clean
and everything will be okay. . . .” “Be careful and don’t do anything
rash. . . .”
Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into
Magnolia Road, and headed toward the darkening play park, he had
(by and large) done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the temp-
tation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for the Burrow
by himself. In fact Harry thought his behavior had been very good
considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet
Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in the hope of hear-
ing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing.
Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man
who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped,
attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the
first place, then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff. . . .
Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the
parched grass. The park was as empty as the surrounding streets.
When he reached the swings he sank onto the only one that Dudley
and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around
the chain, and stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to
hide in the Dursleys’ flower bed again. Tomorrow he would have to
think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, he
had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night,
because even when he escaped nightmares about Cedric he had unset-
tling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and
locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the

9
CHAPTER ONE
trapped feeling he had when he was awake. Often the old scar on his
forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that
Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting any-
more. . . . In the past his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was
getting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would
probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be ex-
pected. . . . Nothing to worry about . . . old news . . .
The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell
with fury. If it hadn’t been for him, nobody would even have known
Voldemort was back! And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whing-
ing for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world,
reduced to squatting among dying begonias so that he could hear
about water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgot-
ten him so easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together without
inviting him along too? How much longer was he supposed to endure
Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the tempta-
tion to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Volde-
mort had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around in Harry’s
head, and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell
around him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass and the only
sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park
railings.
He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the
sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up. The street-
lamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong
enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the
park. One of them was singing a loud, crude song. The others were
laughing. A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing
bikes that they were wheeling along.
Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front was unmis-
takably his cousin, Dudley Dursley, wending his way home, accom-
panied by his faithful gang.

10
DUDLEY DEMENTED
Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year’s hard dieting and the discov-
ery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique. As
Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had
recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Cham-
pion of the Southeast. “The noble sport,” as Uncle Vernon called it,
had made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry
in the primary school days when he had served as Dudley’s first
punching bag. Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin anymore
but he still didn’t think that Dudley learning to punch harder and
more accurately was cause for celebration. Neighborhood children all
around were terrified of him — even more terrified than they were of
“that Potter boy,” who, they had been warned, was a hardened hooli-
gan who attended St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal
Boys.
Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered
whom they had been beating up tonight. Look round, Harry found
himself thinking as he watched them. Come on . . . look round . . . I’m
sitting here all alone. . . . Come and have ago. . . .
If Dudley’s friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to
make a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then? He
wouldn’t want to lose face in front of the gang, but he’d be terrified of
provoking Harry. . . . It would be really fun to watch Dudley’s
dilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond
. . . and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, Harry was ready — he
had his wand . . . let them try . . . He’d love to vent some of his frus-
tration on the boys who had once made his life hell —
But they did not turn around, they did not see him, they were al-
most at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after them.
. . . Seeking a fight was not a smart move. . . . He must not use
magic. . . . He would be risking expulsion again. . . .
Dudley’s gang’s voices died; they were out of sight, heading along
Magnolia Road.

11
CHAPTER ONE
There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing rash. Kept my
nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what you’d have done . . .
He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon
seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to
be home, and anytime after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had
threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home after Dudley
again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, Harry set off toward the park
gate.
Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses
with perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners
who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon’s. Harry preferred
Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches
of jewel-bright colors in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing
disapproving mutters about his “delinquent” appearance when he
passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that halfway along
Magnolia Road Dudley’s gang came into view again; they were saying
their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped
into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited.
“. . . squealed like a pig, didn’t he?” Malcolm was saying, to guffaws
from the others.
“Nice right hook, Big D,” said Piers.
“Same time tomorrow?” said Dudley.
“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said Gordon.
“See you then,” said Dudley.
“Bye Dud!”
“See ya, Big D!”
Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off
again. When their voices had faded once more he headed around the
corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon
came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his
ease, humming tunelessly.
“Hey, Big D!”

12
DUDLEY DEMENTED
Dudley turned.
“Oh,” he grunted. “It’s you.”
“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?” said Harry.
“Shut it,” snarled Dudley, turning away again.
“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his
cousin. “But you’ll always be Ickle Diddykins to me.”
“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled
into fists.
“Don’t the boys know that’s what your mum calls you?”
“Shut your face.”
“You don’t tell her to shut her face. What about ‘popkin’ and
‘Dinky Diddydums,’ can I use them then?”
Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting
Harry seemed to be demanding all his self-control.
“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry asked, his grin
fading. “Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights
ago —”
“He was asking for it,” snarled Dudley.
“Oh yeah?”
“He cheeked me.”
“Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that’s been taught to walk on
its hind legs? ’Cause that’s not cheek, Dud, that’s true . . .”
A muscle was twitching in Dudley’s jaw. It gave Harry enormous
satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as
though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the
only outlet he had.
They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had
first seen Sirius and which formed a shortcut between Magnolia
Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the
streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps
were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on
the other.

13
CHAPTER ONE
“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t you?” Dudley
said after a few seconds.
“What thing?”
“That — that thing you’re hiding.”
Harry grinned again.
“Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s’pose if you were,
you wouldn’t be able to walk and talk at the same time. . . .”
Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it.
“You’re not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know you’re not.
You’d get expelled from that freak school you go to.”
“How d’you know they haven’t changed the rules, Big D?”
“They haven’t,” said Dudley, though he didn’t sound completely
convinced. Harry laughed softly.
“You haven’t got the guts to take me on without that thing, have
you?” Dudley snarled.
“Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat
up a ten-year-old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on
about? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?”
“He was sixteen for your information,” snarled Dudley, “and he was
out cold for twenty minutes after I’d finished with him and he was
twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing
out —”
“Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ fright-
ened of nasty Harry’s wand?”
“Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered Dudley.
“This is night, Diddykins. That’s what we call it when it goes all
dark like this.”
“I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled.
He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin.
From the little he could see of Dudley’s large face, he was wearing a
strangely triumphant look.
“What d’you mean, I’m not brave in bed?” said Harry, completely

14
DUDLEY DEMENTED
nonplussed. “What — am I supposed to be frightened of pillows or
something?”
“I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly. “Talking in your
sleep. Moaning.”
“What d’you mean?” Harry said again, but there was a cold, plung-
ing sensation in his stomach. He had revisited the graveyard last night
in his dreams.
Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a high-pitched,
whimpering voice. “ ‘Don’t kill Cedric! Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s
Cedric — your boyfriend?”
“I — you’re lying —” said Harry automatically. But his mouth had
gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn’t lying — how else would he know
about Cedric?
“ ‘Dad! Help me, Dad! He’s going to kill me, Dad! Boo-hoo!’ ”
“Shut up,” said Harry quietly. “Shut up, Dudley, I’m warning you!”
“ ‘Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! He’s killed
Cedric! Dad, help me! He’s going to —’ Don’t you point that thing at
me!”
Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing the wand di-
rectly at Dudley’s heart. Harry could feel fourteen years’ hatred of
Dudley pounding in his veins — what wouldn’t he give to strike now,
to jinx Dudley so thoroughly he’d have to crawl home like an insect,
struck dumb, sprouting feelers —
“Don’t ever talk about that again,” Harry snarled. “D’you under-
stand me?”
“Point that thing somewhere else!”
“I said, do you understand me?”
“Point it somewhere else!”
“DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?”
“GET THAT THING AWAY FROM —”
Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he had been
doused in icy water.


CHAPTER ONE
Something had happened to the night. The star-strewn indigo sky
was suddenly pitch-black and lightless — the stars, the moon, the
misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant
grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. The balmy evening
was suddenly piercingly, bitingly cold. They were surrounded by total,
impenetrable, silent darkness, as though some giant hand had
dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding them.
For a split second Harry thought he had done magic without
meaning to, despite the fact that he’d been resisting as hard as he
could — then his reason caught up with his senses — he didn’t have
the power to turn off the stars. He turned his head this way and that,
trying to see something, but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a
weightless veil.
Dudley’s terrified voice broke in Harry’s ear.
“W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!”
“I’m not doing anything! Shut up and don’t move!”
“I c-can’t see! I’ve g-gone blind! I —”
“I said shut up!”
Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left and right. The
cold was so intense that he was shivering all over; goose bumps had
erupted up his arms, and the hairs on the back of his neck were stand-
ing up — he opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly
around, unseeing . . .
It was impossible. . . . They couldn’t be here. . . . Not in Little
Whinging . . . He strained his ears. . . . He would hear them before
he saw them. . . .
“I’ll t-tell Dad!” Dudley whimpered. “W-where are you? What are
you d-do — ?”
“Will you shut up?” Harry hissed, “I’m trying to lis —”
But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had been
dreading.
There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, some-

16
DUDLEY DEMENTED
thing that was drawing long, hoarse, rattling breaths. Harry felt a hor-
rible jolt of dread as he stood trembling in the freezing air.
“C-cut it out! Stop doing it! I’ll h-hit you, I swear I will!”
“Dudley, shut —”
WHAM !
A fist made contact with the side of Harry’s head, lifting Harry off
his feet. Small white lights popped in front of Harry’s eyes; for the sec-
ond time in an hour he felt as though his head had been cleaved in
two; next moment he had landed hard on the ground, and his wand
had flown out of his hand.
“You moron, Dudley!” Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain, as
he scrambled to his hands and knees, now feeling around frantically in
the blackness. He heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley
fence, stumbling.
“DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU’RE RUNNING RIGHT AT
IT!”
There was a horrible squealing yell, and Dudley’s footsteps
stopped. At the same moment, Harry felt a creeping chill behind him
that could mean only one thing. There was more than one.
“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU
DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry muttered franti-
cally, his hands flying over the ground like spiders. “Where’s — wand
— come on — Lumos!”
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in
his search — and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his
right hand — the wand tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scram-
bled to his feet, and turned around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him,
hovering over the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes,
sucking on the night as it came.
Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.

17
CHAPTER ONE
“Expecto Patronum!”
A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the de-
mentor slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his
feet, Harry retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him,
panic fogging his brain — concentrate —
A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the dementor’s
robes, reaching for him. A rushing noise filled Harry’s ears.
“Expecto Patronum!”
His voice sounded dim and distant. . . . Another wisp of silver
smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wand — he couldn’t do
it anymore, he couldn’t work the spell —
There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laugh-
ter. . . . He could smell the dementor’s putrid, death-cold breath, fill-
ing his own lungs, drowning him — Think . . . something happy. . . .
But there was no happiness in him. . . . The dementor’s icy fingers
were closing on his throat — the high-pitched laughter was growing
louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head — “Bow to death,
Harry. . . . It might even be painless. . . . I would not know. . . . I have
never died. . . .”
He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again —
And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for
breath —
“EXPECTO PATRONUM !”
An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry’s wand; its
antlers caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have
been; it was thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the stag
charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike and defeated.
“THIS WAY!” Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he
sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. “DUDLEY?
DUDLEY!”
He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley
was curled on the ground, his arms clamped over his face; a second de-

18
DUDLEY DEMENTED
mentor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy
hands, prizing them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded
head toward Dudley’s face as though about to kiss him. . . .
“GET IT!” Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the
silver stag he had conjured came galloping back past him. The de-
mentor’s eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley’s when the silver
antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its
fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness. The stag
cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.
Moon, stars, and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze
swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighboring gardens and the mun-
dane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again. Harry
stood quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to
normality. After a moment he became aware that his T-shirt was stick-
ing to him; he was drenched in sweat.
He could not believe what had just happened. Dementors here, in
Little Whinging . . .
Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking.
Harry bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up, but
then heard loud, running footsteps behind him; instinctively raising
his wand again, he spun on his heel to face the newcomer.
Mrs. Figg, their batty old neighbor, came panting into sight. Her
grizzled gray hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string
shopping bag was swinging from her wrist, and her feet were halfway
out of her tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his wand hur-
riedly out of sight, but —
“Don’t put it away, idiot boy!” she shrieked. “What if there are
more of them around? Oh, I’m going to kill Mundungus Fletcher!”


W
hat?” said Harry blankly.
“He left!” said Mrs. Figg, wringing her hands. “Left to see
someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom!
I told him I’d flay him alive if he went, and now look! Dementors! It’s
just lucky I put Mr. Tibbies on the case! But we haven’t got time to
stand around! Hurry, now, we’ve got to get you back! Oh, the trouble
this is going to cause! I will kill him!”
“But —”
The revelation that his batty old cat-obsessed neighbor knew what
dementors were was almost as big a shock to Harry as meeting two of
them down the alleyway. “You’re — you’re a witch?”
“I’m a Squib, as Mundungus knows full well, so how on earth was
I supposed to help you fight off dementors? He left you completely
without cover when I warned him —”
“This bloke Mundungus has been following me? Hang on — it
was him! He Disapparated from the front of my house!”
“Yes, yes, yes, but luckily I’d stationed Mr. Tibbies under a car just
in case, and Mr. Tibbies came and warned me, but by the time I got


A PECK OF OWLS
to your house you’d gone — and now — oh, what’s Dumbledore go-
ing to say? You!” she shrieked at Dudley, still supine on the alley floor.
“Get your fat bottom off the ground, quick!”
“You know Dumbledore?” said Harry, staring at her.
“Of course I know Dumbledore, who doesn’t know Dumbledore?
But come on — I’ll be no help if they come back, I’ve never so much
as Transfigured a teabag —”
She stooped down, seized one of Dudley’s massive arms in her wiz-
ened hands, and tugged.
“Get up, you useless lump, get up!”
But Dudley either could not or would not move. He was still on
the ground, trembling and ashen-faced, his mouth shut very tight.
“I’ll do it.” Harry took hold of Dudley’s arm and heaved: With an
enormous effort he managed to hoist Dudley to his feet. Dudley
seemed to be on the point of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in
their sockets and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let go
of him he swayed dangerously.
“Hurry up!” said Mrs. Figg hysterically.
Harry pulled one of Dudley’s massive arms around his own shoul-
ders and dragged him toward the road, sagging slightly under his
weight. Mrs. Figg tottered along in front of them, peering anxiously
around the corner.
“Keep your wand out,” she told Harry, as they entered Wisteria
Walk. “Never mind the Statute of Secrecy now, there’s going to be hell
to pay anyway, we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg. Talk
about the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery . . . This was
exactly what Dumbledore was afraid of — what’s that at the end of the
street? Oh, it’s just Mr. Prentice. . . . Don’t put your wand away, boy,
don’t I keep telling you I’m no use?”
It was not easy to hold a wand steady and carry Dudley along at the
same time. Harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but
Dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement. He

21
CHAPTER TWO
was slumped on Harry’s shoulder, his large feet dragging along the
ground.
“Why didn’t you tell me you’re a Squib?” Harry asked Mrs. Figg,
panting with the effort to keep walking. “All those times I came round
your house — why didn’t you say anything?”
“Dumbledore’s orders. I was to keep an eye on you but not say any-
thing, you were too young. I’m sorry I gave you such a miserable time,
but the Dursleys would never have let you come if they’d thought you
enjoyed it. It wasn’t easy, you know. . . . But oh my word,” she said
tragically, wringing her hands once more, “when Dumbledore hears
about this — how could Mundungus have left, he was supposed to be
on duty until midnight — where is he? How am I going to tell Dum-
bledore what’s happened, I can’t Apparate —”
“I’ve got an owl, you can borrow her,” Harry groaned, wondering
whether his spine was going to snap under Dudley’s weight.
“Harry, you don’t understand! Dumbledore will need to act as
quickly as possible, the Ministry have their own ways of detecting un-
derage magic, they’ll know already, you mark my words —”
“But I was getting rid of dementors, I had to use magic — they’re
going to be more worried what dementors were doing floating around
Wisteria Walk, surely?”
“Oh my dear, I wish it were so but I’m afraid — MUNDUNGUS
FLETCHER, I AM GOING TO KILL YOU!”
There was a loud crack and a strong smell of mingled drink and
stale tobacco filled the air as a squat, unshaven man in a tattered over-
coat materialized right in front of them. He had short bandy legs, long
straggly ginger hair, and bloodshot baggy eyes that gave him the dole-
ful look of a basset hound; he was also clutching a silvery bundle that
Harry recognized at once as an Invisibility Cloak.
“ ’S’ up, Figgy?” he said, staring from Mrs. Figg to Harry and Dud-
ley. “What ’appened to staying undercover?”

22
A PECK OF OWLS
“I’ll give you undercover!” cried Mrs. Figg. “Dementors, you useless,
skiving sneak thief!”
“Dementors?” repeated Mundungus, aghast. “Dementors here?”
“Yes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here!” shrieked
Mrs. Figg. “Dementors attacking the boy on your watch!”
“Blimey,” said Mundungus weakly, looking from Mrs. Figg to
Harry and back again. “Blimey, I . . .”
“And you off buying stolen cauldrons! Didn’t I tell you not to go?
Didn’t I ?”
“I — well, I —” Mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable. “It . . .
it was a very good business opportunity, see . . .”
Mrs. Figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and
whacked Mundungus around the face and neck with it; judging by
the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food.
“Ouch — gerroff — gerroff, you mad old bat! Someone’s gotta tell
Dumbledore!”
“Yes — they — have!” yelled Mrs. Figg, still swinging the bag of
cat food at every bit of Mundungus she could reach. “And — it —
had — better — be — you — and — you — can — tell — him —
why — you — weren’t — there — to — help!”
“Keep your ’airnet on!” said Mundungus, his arms over his head,
cowering. “I’m going, I’m going!”
And with another loud crack, he vanished.
“I hope Dumbledore murders him!” said Mrs. Figg furiously. “Now
come on, Harry, what are you waiting for?”
Harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out
that he could barely walk under Dudley’s bulk. He gave the semicon-
scious Dudley a heave and staggered onward.
“I’ll take you to the door,” said Mrs. Figg, as they turned into Privet
Drive. “Just in case there are more of them around. . . . Oh my word,
what a catastrophe . . . and you had to fight them off yourself . . . and

23
CHAPTER TWO
Dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs.
. . . Well, it’s no good crying over spilled potion, I suppose . . . but the
cat’s among the pixies now . . .”
“So,” Harry panted, “Dumbledore’s . . . been having . . . me
followed?”
“Of course he has,” said Mrs. Figg impatiently. “Did you expect
him to let you wander around on your own after what happened in
June? Good Lord, boy, they told me you were intelligent. . . . Right
. . . get inside and stay there,” she said as they reached number four. “I
expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough.”
“What are you going to do?” asked Harry quickly.
“I’m going straight home,” said Mrs. Figg, staring around the dark
street and shuddering. “I’ll need to wait for more instructions. Just
stay in the house. Good night.”
“Hang on, don’t go yet! I want to know —”
But Mrs. Figg had already set off at a trot, carpet slippers flopping,
string bag clanking.
“Wait!” Harry shouted after her; he had a million questions to ask
anyone who was in contact with Dumbledore; but within seconds
Mrs. Figg was swallowed by the darkness. Scowling, Harry readjusted
Dudley on his shoulder and made his slow, painful way up number
four’s garden path.
The hall light was on. Harry stuck his wand back inside the waist-
band of his jeans, rang the bell, and watched Aunt Petunia’s outline
grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the
front door.
“Diddy! About time too, I was getting quite — quite — Diddy,
what’s the matter?”
Harry looked sideways at Dudley and ducked out from under his
arm just in time. Dudley swayed for a moment on the spot, his face
pale green, then he opened his mouth at last and vomited all over the
doormat.

24
A PECK OF OWLS
“DIDDY! Diddy, what’s the matter with you? Vernon? VERNON!”
Harry’s uncle came galumphing out of the living room, walrus mus-
tache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated.
He hurried forward to help Aunt Petunia negotiate a weak-kneed
Dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick.
“He’s ill, Vernon!”
“What is it, son? What’s happened? Did Mrs. Polkiss give you
something foreign for tea?”
“Why are you all covered in dirt, darling? Have you been lying on
the ground?”
“Hang on — you haven’t been mugged, have you, son?”
Aunt Petunia screamed.
“Phone the police, Vernon! Phone the police! Diddy, darling, speak
to Mummy! What did they do to you?”
In all the kerfuffle, nobody seemed to have noticed Harry, which
suited him perfectly. He managed to slip inside just before Uncle Ver-
non slammed the door and while the Dursleys made their noisy
progress down the hall toward the kitchen, Harry moved carefully and
quietly toward the stairs.
“Who did it, son? Give us names. We’ll get them, don’t worry.”
“Shh! He’s trying to say something, Vernon! What is it, Diddy? Tell
Mummy!”
Harry’s foot was on the bottommost stair when Dudley found his
voice.
“Him.”
Harry froze, foot on the stair, face screwed up, braced for the
explosion.
“BOY! COME HERE!”
With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry removed his foot
slowly from the stair and turned to follow the Dursleys.
The scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the
darkness outside. Aunt Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair; he

25
CHAPTER TWO
was still very green and clammy looking. Uncle Vernon was standing
in front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through tiny, nar-
rowed eyes.
“What have you done to my son?” he said in a menacing growl.
“Nothing,” said Harry, knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon
wouldn’t believe him.
“What did he do to you, Diddy?” Aunt Petunia said in a quavering
voice, now sponging sick from the front of Dudley’s leather jacket.
“Was it — was it you-know-what, darling? Did he use — his thing?”
Slowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded.
“I didn’t!” Harry said sharply, as Aunt Petunia let out a wail and
Uncle Vernon raised his fists. “I didn’t do anything to him, it wasn’t
me, it was —”
But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the
kitchen window. Narrowly missing the top of Uncle Vernon’s head, it
soared across the kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it
was carrying in its beak at Harry’s feet, and turned gracefully, the tips
of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside
again and off across the garden.
“OWLS!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in his tem-
ple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut. “OWLS
AGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE OWLS IN MY
HOUSE!”
But Harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out
the letter inside, his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his
Adam’s apple.
Dear Mr. Potter,
We have received intelligence that you performed the Pa-
tronus Charm at twenty-three minutes past nine this evening
in a Muggle-inhabited area and in the presence of a Muggle.
The severity of this breach of the Decree for the Reason-

26
A PECK OF OWLS
able Restriction of Underage Sorcery has resulted in your ex-
pulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of resi-
dence shortly to destroy your wand.
As you have already received an official warning for a
previous offense under section 13 of the International Con-
federation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy, we regret to inform
you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at
the Ministry of Magic at 9 a.m. on August 12th.
Hoping you are well,
Yours sincerely,
improper use of magic office
Ministry of Magic
Harry read the letter through twice. He was only vaguely aware of
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia talking in the vicinity. Inside his
head, all was icy and numb. One fact had penetrated his conscious-
ness like a paralyzing dart. He was expelled from Hogwarts. It was all
over. He was never going back.
He looked up at the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon was purple-faced,
shouting, his fists still raised; Aunt Petunia had her arms around Dud-
ley, who was retching again.
Harry’s temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken. Ministry
representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy
your wand. There was only one thing for it. He would have to run —
now. Where he was going to go, Harry didn’t know, but he was certain
of one thing: At Hogwarts or outside it, he needed his wand. In an
almost dreamlike state, he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the
kitchen.

27
CHAPTER TWO
“Where d’you think you’re going?” yelled Uncle Vernon. When
Harry didn’t reply, he pounded across the kitchen to block the door-
way into the hall. “I haven’t finished with you, boy!”
“Get out of the way,” said Harry quietly.
“You’re going to stay here and explain how my son —”
“If you don’t get out of the way I’m going to jinx you,” said Harry,
raising the wand.
“You can’t pull that one on me!” snarled Uncle Vernon. “I know
you’re not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school!”
“The madhouse has chucked me out,” said Harry. “So I can do
whatever I like. You’ve got three seconds. One — two —”
A resounding CRACK filled the kitchen; Aunt Petunia screamed,
Uncle Vernon yelled and ducked, but for the third time that night
Harry was staring for the source of a disturbance he had not made. He
spotted it at once: A dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was sitting
outside on the kitchen sill, having just collided with the closed
window.
Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s anguished yell of “OWLS!” Harry crossed
the room at a run and wrenched the window open again. The owl
stuck out its leg, to which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook its
feathers, and took off the moment Harry had pulled off the letter.
Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the second message, which was writ-
ten very hastily and blotchily in black ink.
Harry —
Dumbledore’s just arrived at the Ministry, and he’s trying to
sort it all out. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND
UNCLE’S HOUSE. DO NOT DO ANY MORE MAGIC.
DO NOT SURRENDER YOUR WAND.

28
A PECK OF OWLS
Dumbledore was trying to sort it all out. . . . What did that mean?
How much power did Dumbledore have to override the Ministry of
Magic? Was there a chance that he might be allowed back to Hog-
warts, then? A small shoot of hope burgeoned in Harry’s chest, almost
immediately strangled by panic — how was he supposed to refuse to
surrender his wand without doing magic? He’d have to duel with the
Ministry representatives, and if he did that, he’d be lucky to escape
Azkaban, let alone expulsion.
His mind was racing. . . . He could run for it and risk being cap-
tured by the Ministry, or stay put and wait for them to find him here.
He was much more tempted by the former course, but he knew that
Mr. Weasley had his best interests at heart . . . and, after all, Dumble-
dore had sorted out much worse than this before. . . .
“Right,” Harry said, “I’ve changed my mind, I’m staying.”
He flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced Dudley and
Aunt Petunia. The Dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt
change of mind. Aunt Petunia glanced despairingly at Uncle Vernon.
The vein in Uncle Vernon’s purple temple was throbbing worse than
ever.
“Who are all these ruddy owls from?” he growled.
“The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,” said
Harry calmly; he was straining his ears to catch noises outside in case
the Ministry representatives were approaching, and it was easier and
quieter to answer Uncle Vernon’s questions than to have him start rag-
ing and bellowing. “The second one was from my friend Ron’s dad, he
works at the Ministry.”
“Ministry of Magic?” bellowed Uncle Vernon. “People like you in
government? Oh this explains everything, everything, no wonder the
country’s going to the dogs. . . .”
When Harry did not respond, Uncle Vernon glared at him, then
spat, “And why have you been expelled?”

29
CHAPTER TWO
“Because I did magic.”
“AHA!” roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his fist down on the top of
the fridge, which sprang open; several of Dudley’s low-fat snacks top-
pled out and burst on the floor. “So you admit it! What did you do to
Dudley?”
“Nothing,” said Harry, slightly less calmly. “That wasn’t me —”
“Was,” muttered Dudley unexpectedly, and Uncle Vernon and
Aunt Petunia instantly made flapping gestures at Harry to quiet him
while they both bent low over Dudley.
“Go on, son,” said Uncle Vernon, “what did he do?”
“Tell us, darling,” whispered Aunt Petunia.
“Pointed his wand at me,” Dudley mumbled.
“Yeah, I did, but I didn’t use —” Harry began angrily, but . . .
“SHUT UP!” roared Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia in unison.
“Go on, son,” repeated Uncle Vernon, mustache blowing about
furiously.
“All dark,” Dudley said hoarsely, shuddering. “Everything dark.
And then I h-heard . . . things. Inside m-my head . . .”
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia exchanged looks of utter horror.
If their least favorite thing in the world was magic, closely followed
by neighbors who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban,
people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten. They ob-
viously thought Dudley was losing his mind.
“What sort of things did you hear, popkin?” breathed Aunt Petu-
nia, very white-faced and with tears in her eyes.
But Dudley seemed incapable of saying. He shuddered again and
shook his large blond head, and despite the sense of numb dread that
had settled on Harry since the arrival of the first owl, he felt a certain
curiosity. Dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of
their life. . . . What would spoiled, pampered, bullying Dudley have
been forced to hear?
“How come you fell over, son?” said Uncle Vernon in an unnatu-

30
A PECK OF OWLS
rally quiet voice, the kind of voice he would adopt at the bedside of a
very ill person.
“T-tripped,” said Dudley shakily. “And then —”
He gestured at his massive chest. Harry understood: Dudley was re-
membering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happi-
ness were sucked out of you.
“Horrible,” croaked Dudley. “Cold. Really cold.”
“Okay,” said Uncle Vernon in a voice of forced calm, while Aunt
Petunia laid an anxious hand on Dudley’s forehead to feel his temper-
ature. “What happened then, Dudders?”
“Felt . . . felt . . . felt . . . as if. . . as if . . .”
“As if you’d never be happy again,” Harry supplied tonelessly.
“Yes,” Dudley whispered, still trembling.
“So,” said Uncle Vernon, voice restored to full and considerable
volume as he straightened up. “So you put some crackpot spell on my
son so he’d hear voices and believe he was — was doomed to misery,
or something, did you?”
“How many times do I have to tell you?” said Harry, temper and
voice rising together. “It wasn’t me! It was a couple of dementors!”
“A couple of— what’s this codswallop?”
“De — men — tors,” said Harry slowly and clearly. “Two of
them.”
“And what the ruddy hell are dementors?”
“They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban,” said Aunt Petunia.
Two seconds’ ringing silence followed these words and then Aunt
Petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a
disgusting swear word. Uncle Vernon was goggling at her. Harry’s
brain reeled. Mrs. Figg was one thing — but Aunt Petunia?
“How d’you know that?” he asked her, astonished.
Aunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself. She glanced at
Uncle Vernon in fearful apology, then lowered her hand slightly to re-
veal her horsey teeth.

31
CHAPTER TWO
“I heard — that awful boy — telling her about them — years ago,”
she said jerkily.
“If you mean my mum and dad, why don’t you use their names?”
said Harry loudly, but Aunt Petunia ignored him. She seemed horri-
bly flustered.
Harry was stunned. Except for one outburst years ago, in the
course of which Aunt Petunia had screamed that Harry’s mother had
been a freak, he had never heard her mention her sister. He was as-
tounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the
magical world for so long, when she usually put all her energies into
pretending it didn’t exist.
Uncle Vernon opened his mouth, closed it again, opened it once
more, shut it, then, apparently struggling to remember how to talk,
opened it for a third time and croaked, “So — so — they — er —
they — er — they actually exist, do they — er — dementy-whatsits?”
Aunt Petunia nodded.
Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if
hoping somebody was going to shout “April Fool!” When nobody did,
he opened his mouth yet again, but was spared the struggle to find
more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening, which
zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannonball and
landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the
Dursleys to jump with fright. Harry tore a second official-looking en-
velope from the owl’s beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped
back out into the night.
“Enough — effing — owls . . .” muttered Uncle Vernon distract-
edly, stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again.
Dear Mr. Potter,
Further to our letter of approximately twenty-two minutes
ago, the Ministry of Magic has revised its decision to destroy
your wand forthwith. You may retain your wand until your

32
A PECK OF OWLS
disciplinary hearing on 12th August, at which time an official
decision will be taken.
Following discussions with the Headmaster of Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Ministry has agreed
that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that
time. You should therefore consider yourself suspended from

Harry read this letter through three times in quick succession. The
miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly at the thought that he
was not definitely expelled, though his fears were by no means ban-
ished. Everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of
August.
“Well?” said Uncle Vernon, recalling Harry to his surroundings.
“What now? Have they sentenced you to anything? Do your lot have
the death penalty?” he added as a hopeful afterthought.
“I’ve got to go to a hearing,” said Harry.
“And they’ll sentence you there?”
“I suppose so.”
“I won’t give up hope, then,” said Uncle Vernon nastily.
“Well, if that’s all,” said Harry, getting to his feet. He was desperate
to be alone, to think, perhaps to send a letter to Ron, Hermione, or
Sirius.
“NO, IT RUDDY WELL IS NOT ALL!” bellowed Uncle Vernon.
“SIT BACK DOWN!”

CHAPTER TWO
“What now?” said Harry impatiently.
“DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon. “I want to know exactly what
happened to my son!”
“FINE!” yelled Harry, and in his temper, red and gold sparks shot
out of the end of his wand, still clutched in his hand. All three Durs-
leys flinched, looking terrified.
“Dudley and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent
and Wisteria Walk,” said Harry, speaking fast, fighting to control his
temper. “Dudley thought he’d be smart with me, I pulled out my
wand but didn’t use it. Then two dementors turned up —”
“But what ARE dementoids?” asked Uncle Vernon furiously.
“What do they DO?”
“I told you — they suck all the happiness out of you,” said Harry,
“and if they get the chance, they kiss you —”
“Kiss you?” said Uncle Vernon, his eyes popping slightly. “Kiss you?”
“It’s what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth.”
Aunt Petunia uttered a soft scream.
“His soul? They didn’t take — he’s still got his —”
She seized Dudley by the shoulders and shook him, as though test-
ing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him.
“Of course they didn’t get his soul, you’d know if they had,” said
Harry, exasperated.
“Fought ’em off, did you, son?” said Uncle Vernon loudly, with the
appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back onto a
plane he understood. “Gave ’em the old one-two, did you?”
“You can’t give a dementor the old one-two,” said Harry through
clenched teeth.
“Why’s he all right, then?” blustered Uncle Vernon. “Why isn’t he
all empty, then?”
“Because I used the Patronus —”
WHOOSH. With a clattering, a whirring of wings, and a soft fall of
dust, a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace.

34
A PECK OF OWLS
“FOR GOD’S SAKE!” roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps
of hair out of his mustache, something he hadn’t been driven to in a
long time. “I WILL NOT HAVE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT
TOLERATE THIS, I TELL YOU!”
But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the owl’s
leg. He was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore,
explaining everything — the dementors, Mrs. Figg, what the Min-
istry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything
out — that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sir-
ius’s handwriting. Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s ongoing rant about owls
and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most re-
cent owl took off back up the chimney, Harry read Sirius’s message.
Arthur’s just told us what’s happened.
Don’t leave the house again, whatever you do.
Harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that
had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over,
looking for the rest of the letter, but there was nothing there.
And now his temper was rising again. Wasn’t anybody going to say
“well done” for fighting off two dementors single-handedly? Both Mr.
Weasley and Sirius were acting as though he’d misbehaved and they
were saving their tellings-off until they could ascertain how much
damage had been done.
“— a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house
and I won’t have it, boy, I won’t —”
“I can’t stop the owls coming,” Harry snapped, crushing Sirius’s let-
ter in his fist.
“I want the truth about what happened tonight!” barked Uncle
Vernon. “If it was demenders who hurt Dudley, how come you’ve
been expelled? You did you-know-what, you’ve admitted it!”
Harry took a deep, steadying breath. His head was beginning to

35
CHAPTER TWO
ache again. He wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen,
away from the Dursleys.
“I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the dementors,” he said,
forcing himself to remain calm. “It’s the only thing that works against
them.”
“But what were dementoids doing in Little Whinging?” said Uncle
Vernon in tones of outrage.
“Couldn’t tell you,” said Harry wearily. “No idea.”
His head was pounding in the glare of the strip lighting now. His
anger was ebbing away. He felt drained, exhausted. The Dursleys were
all staring at him.
“It’s you,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. “It’s got something to do
with you, boy, I know it. Why else would they turn up here? Why else
would they be down that alleyway? You’ve got to be the only — the
only —” Evidently he couldn’t bring himself to say the word “wizard.”
“The only you-know-what for miles.”
“I don’t know why they were here. . . .”
But at these words of Uncle Vernon’s, Harry’s exhausted brain
ground back into action. Why had the dementors come to Little
Whinging? How could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the
alleyway where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the Ministry of
Magic lost control of the dementors, had they deserted Azkaban and
joined Voldemort, as Dumbledore had predicted they would?
“These demembers guard some weirdos’ prison?” said Uncle Ver-
non, lumbering in the wake of Harry’s train of thought.
“Yes,” said Harry.
If only his head would stop hurting, if only he could just leave the
kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think. . . .
“Oho! They were coming to arrest you!” said Uncle Vernon, with
the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion.
“That’s it, isn’t it, boy? You’re on the run from the law!”

36
A PECK OF OWLS
“Of course I’m not,” said Harry, shaking his head as though to
scare off a fly, his mind racing now.
“Then why — ?”
“He must have sent them,” said Harry quietly, more to himself
than to Uncle Vernon.
“What’s that? Who must have sent them?”
“Lord Voldemort,” said Harry.
He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who
flinched, winced, and squawked if they heard words like “wizard,”
“magic,” or “wand,” could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all
time without the slightest tremor.
“Lord — hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, his face screwed up, a look
of dawning comprehension in his piggy eyes. “I’ve heard that name
. . . that was the one who . . .”
“Murdered my parents, yes,” Harry said.
“But he’s gone,” said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slight-
est sign that the murder of Harry’s parents might be a painful topic to
anybody. “That giant bloke said so. He’s gone.”
“He’s back,” said Harry heavily.
It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia’s surgically
clean kitchen, beside the top-of-the-range fridge and the wide-screen
television, and talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon.
The arrival of the dementors in Little Whinging seemed to have
caused a breach in the great, invisible wall that divided the relentlessly
non-magical world of Privet Drive and the world beyond. Harry’s two
lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned up-
side down: The Dursleys were asking for details about the magical
world and Mrs. Figg knew Albus Dumbledore; dementors were soar-
ing around Little Whinging and he might never go back to Hogwarts.
Harry’s head throbbed more painfully.
“Back?” whispered Aunt Petunia.

37
CHAPTER TWO
She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at him before.
And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, Harry fully ap-
preciated that Aunt Petunia was his mother’s sister. He could not have
said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment. All he knew
was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling
of what Lord Voldemort being back might mean. Aunt Petunia had
never in her life looked at him like that before. Her large, pale eyes (so
unlike her sister’s) were not narrowed in dislike or anger: They were
wide and fearful. The furious pretense that Aunt Petunia had main-
tained all Harry’s life — that there was no magic and no world other
than the world she inhabited with Uncle Vernon — seemed to have
fallen away.
“Yes,” Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia now. “He came
back a month ago. I saw him.”
Her hands found Dudley’s massive leather-clad shoulders and
clutched them.
“Hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and
back again, apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented un-
derstanding that seemed to have sprung up between them. “Hang on.
This Lord Voldything’s back, you say.”
“Yes.”
“The one who murdered your parents.”
“Yes.”
“And now he’s sending dismembers after you?”
“Looks like it,” said Harry.
“I see,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his white-faced wife to
Harry and hitching up his trousers. He seemed to be swelling, his
great purple face stretching before Harry’s eyes. “Well, that settles it,”
he said, his shirt front straining as he inflated himself, “you can get out
of this house, boy!”
“What?” said Harry.
“You heard me — OUT!” Uncle Vernon bellowed, and even Aunt


A PECK OF OWLS
Petunia and Dudley jumped. “OUT! OUT! I should’ve done it years
ago! Owls treating the place like a rest home, puddings exploding, half
the lounge destroyed, Dudley’s tail, Marge bobbing around on the
ceiling, and that flying Ford Anglia — OUT! OUT! You’ve had it!
You’re history! You’re not staying here if some loony’s after you, you’re
not endangering my wife and son, you’re not bringing trouble down
on us, if you’re going the same way as your useless parents, I’ve had it!
OUT!”
Harry stood rooted to the spot. The letters from the Ministry,
Mr. Weasley, and Sirius were crushed in his left hand. Don’t leave the
house again, whatever you do. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND
UNCLE’S HOUSE.
“You heard me!” said Uncle Vernon, bending forward now, so that
his massive purple face came closer to Harry’s, so that Harry actually
felt flecks of spit hit his face. “Get going! You were all keen to leave
half an hour ago! I’m right behind you! Get out and never darken our
doorstep again! Why we ever kept you in the first place I don’t know.
Marge was right, it should have been the orphanage, we were too
damn soft for our own good, thought we could squash it out of you,
thought we could turn you normal, but you’ve been rotten from the
beginning, and I’ve had enough — OWLS!”
The fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the
floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech. Harry
raised his hand to seize the letter, which was in a scarlet envelope, but
it soared straight over his head, flying directly at Aunt Petunia, who let
out a scream and ducked, her arms over her face. The owl dropped the
red envelope on her head, turned, and flew straight up the chimney
again.
Harry darted forward to pick up the letter, but Aunt Petunia beat
him to it.
“You can open it if you like,” said Harry, “but I’ll hear what it says
anyway. That’s a Howler.”

39
CHAPTER TWO
“Let go of it, Petunia!” roared Uncle Vernon. “Don’t touch it, it
could be dangerous!”
“It’s addressed to me,” said Aunt Petunia in a shaking voice. “It’s
addressed to me, Vernon, look! Mrs. Petunia Dursley, The Kitchen,
Number Four, Privet Drive —”
She caught her breath, horrified. The red envelope had begun to
smoke.
“Open it!” Harry urged her. “Get it over with! It’ll happen
anyway —”
“No —”
Aunt Petunia’s hand was trembling. She looked wildly around the
kitchen as though looking for an escape route, but too late — the en-
velope burst into flames. Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it.
An awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the confined space, is-
suing from the burning letter on the table.
“REMEMBER MY LAST, PETUNIA.”
Aunt Petunia looked as though she might faint. She sank into the
chair beside Dudley, her face in her hands. The remains of the enve-
lope smoldered into ash in the silence.
“What is this?” Uncle Vernon said hoarsely. “What — I don’t —
Petunia?”
Aunt Petunia said nothing. Dudley was staring stupidly at his
mother, his mouth hanging open. The silence spiraled horribly. Harry
was watching his aunt, utterly bewildered, his head throbbing fit to
burst.
“Petunia, dear?” said Uncle Vernon timidly. “P-Petunia?”
She raised her head. She was still trembling. She swallowed.
“The boy — the boy will have to stay, Vernon,” she said weakly.
“W-what?”

40
A PECK OF OWLS
“He stays,” she said. She was not looking at Harry. She got to her
feet again.
“He . . . but Petunia . . .”
“If we throw him out, the neighbors will talk,” she said. She was re-
gaining her usual brisk, snappish manner rapidly, though she was still
very pale. “They’ll ask awkward questions, they’ll want to know where
he’s gone. We’ll have to keep him.”
Uncle Vernon was deflating like an old tire.
“But Petunia, dear —”
Aunt Petunia ignored him. She turned to Harry.
“You’re to stay in your room,” she said. “You’re not to leave the
house. Now get to bed.”
Harry didn’t move.
“Who was that Howler from?”
“Don’t ask questions,” Aunt Petunia snapped.
“Are you in touch with wizards?”
“I told you to get to bed!”
“What did it mean? Remember the last what?”
“Go to bed!”
“How come — ?”
“YOU HEARD YOUR AUNT, NOW GET TO BED!”

CHAPTER T H R E E
THE ADVANCED GUARD
I
’ve just been attacked by dementors and I might be expelled from
Hogwarts. I want to know what’s going on and when I’m going to get
out of here.
Harry copied these words onto three separate pieces of parchment
the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom. He addressed
the first to Sirius, the second to Ron, and the third to Hermione. His
owl, Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on the desk.
Harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back, his head
pounding, his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and
itched with tiredness. His back ached from carrying Dudley home,
and the two lumps on his head where the window and Dudley had hit
him were throbbing painfully.
Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration,
grinding his teeth and clenching his fists, casting angry looks out at
the empty, star-strewn sky every time he passed the window. Demen-
tors sent to get him, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him
in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Min-
istry of Magic — and still no one was telling him what was going on.

42
THE ADVANCED GUARD
And what, what, had that Howler been about? Whose voice had
echoed so horribly, so menacingly, through the kitchen?
Why was he still trapped here without information? Why was
everyone treating him like some naughty kid? Don’t do any more
magic, stay in the house. . . .
He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far from relieving his
anger he felt worse, as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with
in addition to the pain in the rest of his body.
Just as he limped past the window, Hedwig soared through it with
a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost.
“About time!” Harry snarled, as she landed lightly on top of her
cage. “You can put that down, I’ve got work for you!”
Hedwig’s large round amber eyes gazed reproachfully at him over
the dead frog clamped in her beak.
“Come here,” said Harry, picking up the three small rolls of parch-
ment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg. “Take
these straight to Sirius, Ron, and Hermione and don’t come back here
without good long replies. Keep pecking them till they’ve written
decent-length answers if you’ve got to. Understand?”
Hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise, beak still full of frog.
“Get going, then,” said Harry.
She took off immediately. The moment she’d gone, Harry threw
himself down onto his bed without undressing and stared at the dark
ceiling. In addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty
that he’d been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he had at
number four, Privet Drive. But he’d make it up to her when she came
back with Sirius’s, Ron’s, and Hermione’s answers.
They were bound to write back quickly; they couldn’t possibly ig-
nore a dementor attack. He’d probably wake up tomorrow to three fat
letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the
Burrow. And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, stifling
all further thought.

43
CHAPTER THREE


But Hedwig didn’t return next morning. Harry spent the day in his
bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom. Three times that day
Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat flap Uncle
Vernon had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry heard her
approaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might
as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got.
Otherwise the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom. Harry couldn’t
see the point of forcing his company on them; another row would
achieve nothing except perhaps making him so angry he’d perform
more illegal magic.
So it went on for three whole days. Harry was filled alternately with
restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during
which he paced his bedroom again, furious at the whole lot of them
for leaving him to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete
that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into
space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing.
What if they ruled against him? What if he was expelled and his
wand was snapped in half? What would he do, where would he go?
He could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now
that he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged.
. . . Was it possible that he might be able to move into Sirius’s house,
as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before he had been forced to flee
from the Ministry himself? Would he be allowed to live there alone,
given that he was still underage? Or would the matter of where he
went next be decided for him; had his breach of the International
Statute of Secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in Azka-
ban? Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid off his
bed and began pacing again.
On the fourth night after Hedwig’s departure Harry was lying in
one of his apathetic phases, staring at the ceiling, his exhausted mind

44
THE ADVANCED GUARD
quite blank, when his uncle entered his bedroom. Harry looked
slowly around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit and an
expression of enormous smugness.
“We’re going out,” he said.
“Sorry?”
“We — that is to say, your aunt, Dudley, and I — are going out.”
“Fine,” said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling.
“You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.”
“Okay.”
“You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our
possessions.”
“Right.”
“You are not to steal food from the fridge.”
“Okay.”
“I am going to lock your door.”
“You do that.”
Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of ar-
gument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind
him. Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon’s foot-
steps walking heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later he heard the
slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakable
sound of the car sweeping out of the drive.
Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving. It made
no difference to him whether they were in the house or not. He could
not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light.
The room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the
night sounds through the window he kept open all the time, waiting
for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned.
The empty house creaked around him. The pipes gurgled. Harry
lay there in a kind of stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in
misery.
And then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below.

45
CHAPTER THREE
He sat bolt upright, listening intently. The Dursleys couldn’t be
back, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadn’t heard their car.
There was silence for a few seconds, and then he heard voices.
Burglars, he thought, sliding off the bed onto his feet — but a split
second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices
down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly
not troubling to do so.
He snatched up his wand from his bedside table and stood facing
his bedroom door, listening with all his might. Next moment he
jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open.
Harry stood motionless, staring through the open door at the dark
upstairs landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came.
He hesitated for a moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of
his room to the head of the stairs.
His heart shot upward into his throat. There were people standing
in the shadowy hall below, silhouetted against the streetlight glowing
through the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he could
see, looking up at him.
“Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone’s eye out,” said a
low, growling voice.
Harry’s heart was thumping uncontrollably. He knew that voice,
but he did not lower his wand.
“Professor Moody?” he said uncertainly.
“I don’t know so much about ‘Professor,’ ” growled the voice, “never
got round to much teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you
properly.”
Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it, nor
did he move. He had very good reason to be suspicious. He had re-
cently spent nine months in what he had thought was Mad-Eye
Moody’s company only to find out that it wasn’t Moody at all, but an
impostor; an impostor, moreover, who had tried to kill Harry before

46
THE ADVANCED GUARD
being unmasked. But before he could make a decision about what to
do next, a second, slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs.
“It’s all right, Harry. We’ve come to take you away.”
Harry’s heart leapt. He knew that voice too, though he hadn’t
heard it for more than a year.
“P-Professor Lupin?” he said disbelievingly. “Is that you?”
“Why are we all standing in the dark?” said a third voice, this one
completely unfamiliar, a woman’s. “Lumos.”
A wand tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light. Harry
blinked. The people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs,
gazing intently up at him, some craning their heads for a better look.
Remus Lupin stood nearest to him. Though still quite young,
Lupin looked tired and rather ill; he had more gray hair than when
Harry had said good-bye to him, and his robes were more patched
and shabbier than ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry,
who tried to smile back through his shock.
“Oooh, he looks just like I thought he would,” said the witch who
was holding her lit wand aloft. She looked the youngest there; she had
a pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes, and short spiky hair that
was a violent shade of violet. “Wotcher, Harry!”
“Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,” said a bald black wizard
standing farthest back; he had a deep, slow voice and wore a single
gold hoop in his ear. “He looks exactly like James.”
“Except the eyes,” said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired wizard at the
back. “Lily’s eyes.”
Mad-Eye Moody, who had long grizzled gray hair and a large
chunk missing from his nose, was squinting suspiciously at Harry
through his mismatched eyes. One of the eyes was small, dark, and
beady, the other large, round, and electric blue — the magical eye that
could see through walls, doors, and the back of Moody’s own head.
“Are you quite sure it’s him, Lupin?” he growled. “It’d be a nice

47
CHAPTER THREE
lookout if we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him. We
ought to ask him something only the real Potter would know. Unless
anyone brought any Veritaserum?”
“Harry, what form does your Patronus take?” said Lupin.
“A stag,” said Harry nervously.
“That’s him, Mad-Eye,” said Lupin.
Harry descended the stairs, very conscious of everybody still staring
at him, stowing his wand into the back pocket of his jeans as he came.
“Don’t put your wand there, boy!” roared Moody. “What if it ig-
nited? Better wizards than you have lost buttocks, you know!”
“Who d’you know who’s lost a buttock?” the violet-haired woman
asked Mad-Eye interestedly.
“Never you mind, you just keep your wand out of your back
pocket!” growled Mad-Eye. “Elementary wand safety, nobody bothers
about it anymore. . . .” He stumped off toward the kitchen. “And I saw
that,” he added irritably, as the woman rolled her eyes at the ceiling.
Lupin held out his hand and shook Harry’s.
“How are you?” he asked, looking at Harry closely.
“F-fine . . .”
Harry could hardly believe this was real. Four weeks with nothing,
not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from Privet Drive, and
suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matter-of-factly in
the house as though this were a long-standing arrangement. He
glanced at the people surrounding Lupin; they were still gazing avidly
at him. He felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his
hair for four days.
“I’m — you’re really lucky the Dursleys are out . . .” he mumbled.
“Lucky, ha!” said the violet-haired woman. “It was me that lured
them out of the way. Sent a letter by Muggle post telling them they’d
been short-listed for the All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn
Competition. They’re heading off to the prize-giving right now. . . .
Or they think they are.”

48
THE ADVANCED GUARD
Harry had a fleeting vision of Uncle Vernon’s face when he realized
there was no All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn Competition.
“We are leaving, aren’t we?” he asked. “Soon?”
“Almost at once,” said Lupin, “we’re just waiting for the all-clear.”
“Where are we going? The Burrow?” Harry asked hopefully.
“Not the Burrow, no,” said Lupin, motioning Harry toward the
kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curi-
ously. “Too risky. We’ve set up headquarters somewhere undetectable.
It’s taken a while. . . .”
Mad-Eye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging
from a hip flask, his magical eye spinning in all directions, taking in
the Dursleys’ many labor-saving appliances.
“This is Alastor Moody, Harry,” Lupin continued, pointing toward
Moody.
“Yeah, I know,” said Harry uncomfortably; it felt odd to be intro-
duced to somebody he’d thought he’d known for a year.
“And this is Nymphadora —”
“Don’t call me Nymphadora, Remus,” said the young witch with a
shudder. “It’s Tonks.”
“— Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her surname
only,” finished Lupin.
“So would you if your fool of a mother had called you ‘Nympha-
dora,’ ” muttered Tonks.
“And this is Kingsley Shacklebolt” — he indicated the tall black
wizard, who bowed — “Elphias Doge” — the wheezy-voiced wizard
nodded — “Dedalus Diggle —”
“We’ve met before,” squeaked the excitable Diggle, dropping his
top hat.
“— Emmeline Vance” — a stately looking witch in an emerald-
green shawl inclined her head — “Sturgis Podmore” — a square-jawed
wizard with thick, straw-colored hair winked — “and Hestia Jones.” A
pink-cheeked, black-haired witch waved from next to the toaster.

CHAPTER THREE
Harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were in-
troduced. He wished they would look at something other than him; it
was as though he had suddenly been ushered onstage. He also won-
dered why so many of them were there.
“A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,”
said Lupin, as though he had read Harry’s mind; the corners of his
mouth twitched slightly.
“Yeah, well, the more the better,” said Moody darkly. “We’re your
guard, Potter.”
“We’re just waiting for the signal to tell us it’s safe to set off,” said
Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window. “We’ve got about fifteen
minutes.”
“Very clean, aren’t they, these Muggles?” said the witch called
Tonks, who was looking around the kitchen with great interest. “My
dad’s Muggle-born and he’s a right old slob. I suppose it varies, just
like with wizards?”
“Er — yeah,” said Harry. “Look” — he turned back to Lupin —
“what’s going on, I haven’t heard anything from anyone, what’s Vol — ?”
Several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises;
Dedalus Diggle dropped his hat again, and Moody growled, “Shut up!”
“What?” said Harry.
“We’re not discussing anything here, it’s too risky,” said Moody,
turning his normal eye on Harry; his magical eye remained pointing
up at the ceiling. “Damn it,” he added angrily, putting a hand up to
the magical eye, “it keeps sticking — ever since that scum wore it —”
And with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being
pulled from a sink, he popped out his eye.
“Mad-Eye, you do know that’s disgusting, don’t you?” said Tonks
conversationally.
“Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry?” asked Moody.
Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean glass, and filled it


with water at the sink, still watched eagerly by the band of wizards.
Their relentless staring was starting to annoy him.
“Cheers,” said Moody, when Harry handed him the glass. He
dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and
down; the eye whizzed around, staring at them all in turn. “I want
three-hundred-and-sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.”
“How’re we getting — wherever we’re going?” Harry asked.
“Brooms,” said Lupin. “Only way. You’re too young to Apparate,
they’ll be watching the Floo Network, and it’s more than our life’s
worth to set up an unauthorized Portkey.”
“Remus says you’re a good flier,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his
deep voice.
“He’s excellent,” said Lupin, who was checking his watch. “Any-
way, you’d better go and get packed, Harry, we want to be ready to go
when the signal comes.”
“I’ll come and help you,” said Tonks brightly.
She followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking
around with much curiosity and interest.
“Funny place,” she said, “it’s a bit too clean, d’you know what I
mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is better,” she added, as they entered
Harry’s bedroom and he turned on the light.
His room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house.
Confined to it for four days in a very bad mood, Harry had not both-
ered tidying up after himself. Most of the books he owned were strewn
over the floor where he’d tried to distract himself with each in turn and
thrown it aside. Hedwig’s cage needed cleaning out and was starting to
smell, and his trunk lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle
clothes and wizard’s robes that had spilled onto the floor around it.
Harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his
trunk. Tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her re-
flection in the mirror on the inside of the door.

“You know, I don’t think purple’s really my color,” she said pen-
sively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair. “D’you think it makes me look
a bit peaky?”
“Er —” said Harry, looking up at her over the top of Quidditch
Teams of Britain and Ireland.
“Yeah, it does,” said Tonks decisively. She screwed up her eyes in a
strained expression as though she were struggling to remember some-
thing. A second later, her hair had turned bubble-gum pink.
“How did you do that?” said Harry, gaping at her as she opened her
eyes again.
“I’m a Metamorphmagus,” she said, looking back at her reflection
and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions.
“It means I can change my appearance at will,” she added, spotting
Harry’s puzzled expression in the mirror behind her. “I was born one.
I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training
without any study at all, it was great.”
“You’re an Auror?” said Harry, impressed. Being a Dark wizard
catcher was the only career he’d ever considered after Hogwarts.
“Yeah,” said Tonks, looking proud. “Kingsley is as well; he’s a bit
higher up than I am, though. I only qualified a year ago. Nearly failed
on Stealth and Tracking, I’m dead clumsy, did you hear me break that
plate when we arrived downstairs?”
“Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?” Harry asked her,
straightening up, completely forgetting about packing.
Tonks chuckled.
“Bet you wouldn’t mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?”
Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry’s forehead.
“No, I wouldn’t mind,” Harry mumbled, turning away. He did not
like people staring at his scar.
“Well, you’ll have to learn the hard way, I’m afraid,” said Tonks.
“Metamorphmagi are really rare, they’re born, not made. Most wiz-
ards need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance. . . .


THE ADVANCED GUARD
But we’ve got to get going, Harry, we’re supposed to be packing,” she
added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor.
“Oh — yeah,” said Harry, grabbing up a few more books.
“Don’t be stupid, it’ll be much quicker if I — pack!” cried Tonks,
waving her wand in a long, sweeping movement over the floor.
Books, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into the air and flew
pell-mell into the trunk.
“It’s not very neat,” said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and look-
ing down at the jumble inside. “My mum’s got this knack of getting
stuff to fit itself in neatly — she even gets the socks to fold them-
selves — but I’ve never mastered how she does it — it’s a kind of
flick —”
She flicked her wand hopefully; one of Harry’s socks gave a feeble
sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess within.
“Ah, well,” said Tonks, slamming the trunk’s lid shut, “at least it’s all
in. That could do with a bit of cleaning, too — Scourgify —” She
pointed her wand at Hedwig’s cage; a few feathers and droppings van-
ished. “Well, that’s a bit better — I’ve never quite got the hang of
these sort of householdy spells. Right — got everything? Cauldron?
Broom? Wow! A Firebolt?”
Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry’s right
hand. It was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international stan-
dard broomstick.
“And I’m still riding a Comet Two Sixty,” said Tonks enviously. “Ah
well . . . wand still in your jeans? Both buttocks still on? Okay, let’s go.
Locomotor Trunk.”
Harry’s trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding her wand like a
conductor’s baton, Tonks made it hover across the room and out of the
door ahead of them, Hedwig’s cage in her left hand. Harry followed her
down the stairs carrying his broomstick.
Back in the kitchen, Moody had replaced his eye, which was
spinning so fast after its cleaning it made Harry feel sick. Kingsley

CHAPTER THREE
Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore were examining the microwave and
Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while
rummaging in the drawers. Lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the
Dursleys.
“Excellent,” said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered.
“We’ve got about a minute, I think. We should probably get out into
the garden so we’re ready. Harry, I’ve left a letter telling your aunt and
uncle not to worry —”
“They won’t,” said Harry.
“That you’re safe —”
“That’ll just depress them.”
“— and you’ll see them next summer.”
“Do I have to?”
Lupin smiled but made no answer.
“Come here, boy,” said Moody gruffly, beckoning Harry toward
him with his wand. “I need to Disillusion you.”
“You need to what?” said Harry nervously.
“Disillusionment Charm,” said Moody, raising his wand. “Lupin
says you’ve got an Invisibility Cloak, but it won’t stay on while we’re
flying; this’ll disguise you better. Here you go —”
He rapped Harry hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a cu-
rious sensation as though Moody had just smashed an egg there; cold
trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand
had struck.
“Nice one, Mad-Eye,” said Tonks appreciatively, staring at Harry’s
midriff.
Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body,
for it didn’t look anything like his anymore. It was not invisible; it had
simply taken on the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind
him. He seemed to have become a human chameleon.
“Come on,” said Moody, unlocking the back door with his wand.
They all stepped outside onto Uncle Vernon’s beautifully kept lawn.

“Clear night,” grunted Moody, his magical eye scanning the heav-
ens. “Could’ve done with a bit more cloud cover. Right, you,” he
barked at Harry, “we’re going to be flying in close formation. Tonks’ll
be right in front of you, keep close on her tail. Lupin’ll be covering
you from below. I’m going to be behind you. The rest’ll be circling us.
We don’t break ranks for anything, got me? If one of us is killed —”
“Is that likely?” Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody ignored
him.
“— the others keep flying, don’t stop, don’t break ranks. If they
take out all of us and you survive, Harry, the rear guard are standing
by to take over; keep flying east and they’ll join you.”
“Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he’ll think we’re not taking this
seriously,” said Tonks, as she strapped Harry’s trunk and Hedwig’s
cage into a harness hanging from her broom.
“I’m just telling the boy the plan,” growled Moody. “Our job’s to
deliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attempt —”
“No one’s going to die,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep,
calming voice.
“Mount your brooms, that’s the first signal!” said Lupin sharply,
pointing into the sky.
Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had flared among
the stars. Harry recognized them at once as wand sparks. He swung
his right leg over his Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly, and felt it
vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in
the air once more.
“Second signal, let’s go!” said Lupin loudly, as more sparks, green
this time, exploded high above them.
Harry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night air rushed
through his hair as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away,
shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and
every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as
though the rush of air had blown it out of his head. He felt as though

55
CHAPTER THREE
his heart was going to explode with pleasure; he was flying again, fly-
ing away from Privet Drive as he’d been fantasizing about all summer,
he was going home. . . . For a few glorious moments, all his problems
seemed to recede into nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky.
“Hard left, hard left, there’s a Muggle looking up!” shouted Moody
from behind him. Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching
his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom. “We need more height.
. . . Give it another quarter of a mile!”
Harry’s eyes watered in the chill as they soared upward; he could see
nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights
and streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Ver-
non’s car. . . . The Dursleys would be heading back to their empty
house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition
. . . and Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was
drowned by the flapping of the others’ robes, the creaking of the har-
ness holding his trunk and the cage, the whoosh of the wind in their
ears as they sped through the air. He had not felt this alive in a month,
or this happy. . . .
“Bearing south!” shouted Mad-Eye. “Town ahead!”
They soared right, so that they did not pass directly over the glit-
tering spiderweb of lights below.
“Bear southeast and keep climbing, there’s some low cloud ahead
we can lose ourselves in!” called Moody.
“We’re not going through clouds!” shouted Tonks angrily. “We’ll
get soaked, Mad-Eye!”
Harry was relieved to hear her say this; his hands were growing
numb on the Firebolt’s handle. He wished he had thought to put on a
coat; he was starting to shiver.
They altered their course every now and then according to Mad-
Eye’s instructions. Harry’s eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy
wind that was starting to make his ears ache. He could remember be-
ing this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch

match against Hufflepuff in his third year, which had taken place in a
storm. The guard around him was circling continuously like giant
birds of prey. Harry lost track of time. He wondered how long they
had been flying; it felt like an hour at least.
“Turning southwest!” yelled Moody. “We want to avoid the
motorway!”
Harry was now so chilled that he thought longingly for a moment
of the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming along below, then, even
more longingly, of traveling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfort-
able to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames.
. . . Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around him, bald pate and earring
gleaming slightly in the moonlight. . . . Now Emmeline Vance was on
his right, her wand out, her head turning left and right . . . then she
too swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore. . . .
“We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure we’re not be-
ing followed!” Moody shouted.
“ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE?” Tonks screamed from the front.
“We’re all frozen to our brooms! If we keep going off course we’re not
going to get there until next week! We’re nearly there now!”
“Time to start the descent!” came Lupin’s voice. “Follow Tonks,
Harry!”
Harry followed Tonks into a dive. They were heading for the largest
collection of lights he had yet seen, a huge, sprawling, crisscrossing
mass, glittering in lines and grids, interspersed with patches of deep-
est black. Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could see individual
headlights and streetlamps, chimneys, and television aerials. He
wanted to reach the ground very much, though he felt sure that some-
one would have to unfreeze him from his broom.
“Here we go!” called Tonks, and a few seconds later she had landed.
Harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch
of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square. Tonks was already
unbuckling Harry’s trunk. Shivering, Harry looked around. The grimy

57
CHAPTER THREE
fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them
had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the street-
lamps, paint was peeling from many of the doors, and heaps of rubbish
lay outside several sets of front steps.
“Where are we?” Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, “In a minute.”
Moody was rummaging in his cloak, his gnarled hands clumsy with
cold.
“Got it,” he muttered, raising what looked like a silver cigarette
lighter into the air and clicking it.
The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. He clicked the un-
lighter again; the next lamp went out. He kept clicking until every
lamp in the square was extinguished and the only light in the square
came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead.
“Borrowed it from Dumbledore,” growled Moody, pocketing the
Put-Outer. “That’ll take care of any Muggles looking out of the win-
dow, see? Now, come on, quick.”
He took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass,
across the road, and onto the pavement. Lupin and Tonks followed,
carrying Harry’s trunk between them, the rest of the guard, all with
their wands out, flanking them.
The muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper win-
dow in the nearest house. A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came
from the pile of bulging bin-bags just inside the broken gate.
“Here,” Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of parchment toward
Harry’s Disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it, so as
to illuminate the writing. “Read quickly and memorize.”
Harry looked down at the piece of paper. The narrow handwriting
was vaguely familiar. It said:
The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at
number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London.

NUMBER TWELVE,
GRIMMAULD PLACE
W
hat’s the Order of the — ?” Harry began.
“Not here, boy!” snarled Moody. “Wait till we’re inside!”
He pulled the piece of parchment out of Harry’s hand and set fire
to it with his wand tip. As the message curled into flames and floated
to the ground, Harry looked around at the houses again. They were
standing outside number eleven; he looked to the left and saw num-
ber ten; to the right, however, was number thirteen.
“But where’s — ?”
“Think about what you’ve just memorized,” said Lupin quietly.
Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about num-
ber twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of
nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by
dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had
inflated, pushing those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at it.
The stereo in number eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles in-
side hadn’t even felt anything.
“Come on, hurry,” growled Moody, prodding Harry in the back.

59
CHAPTER FOUR
Harry walked up the worn stone steps, staring at the newly materi-
alized door. Its black paint was shabby and scratched. The silver door
knocker was in the form of a twisted serpent. There was no keyhole or
letterbox.
Lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once. Harry heard
many loud, metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a
chain. The door creaked open.
“Get in quick, Harry,” Lupin whispered. “But don’t go far inside
and don’t touch anything.”
Harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of
the hall. He could smell damp, dust, and a sweetish, rotting smell; the
place had the feeling of a derelict building. He looked over his shoul-
der and saw the others filing in behind him, Lupin and Tonks carrying
his trunk and Hedwig’s cage. Moody was standing on the top step and
releasing the balls of light the Put-Outer had stolen from the street-
lamps; they flew back to their bulbs and the square beyond glowed
momentarily with orange light before Moody limped inside and
closed the front door, so that the darkness in the hall became complete.
“Here —”
He rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand; Harry felt as
though something hot was trickling down his back this time and
knew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted.
“Now stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light in here,”
Moody whispered.
The others’ hushed voices were giving Harry an odd feeling of fore-
boding; it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying
person. He heard a soft hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas
lamps sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a flickering insub-
stantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a
long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered over-
head and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls. Harry

60
NUMBER TWELVE,
GRIMMAULD PLACE
heard something scuttling behind the baseboard. Both the chandelier
and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents.
There were hurried footsteps and Ron’s mother, Mrs. Weasley,
emerged from a door at the far end of the hall. She was beaming in
welcome as she hurried toward them, though Harry noticed that she
was rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen
her.
“Oh, Harry, it’s lovely to see you!” she whispered, pulling him into
a rib-cracking hug before holding him at arm’s length and examining
him critically. “You’re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you’ll
have to wait a bit for dinner, I’m afraid. . . .”
She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered ur-
gently, “He’s just arrived, the meeting’s started. . . .”
The wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest and excite-
ment and began filing past Harry toward the door through which
Mrs. Weasley had just come; Harry made to follow Lupin, but Mrs.
Weasley held him back.
“No, Harry, the meeting’s only for members of the Order. Ron and
Hermione are upstairs, you can wait with them until the meeting’s
over and then we’ll have dinner. And keep your voice down in the
hall,” she added in an urgent whisper.
“Why?”
“I don’t want to wake anything up.”
“What d’you — ?”
“I’ll explain later, I’ve got to hurry, I’m supposed to be at the meet-
ing — I’ll just show you where you’re sleeping.”
Pressing her finger to her lips, she led him on tiptoes past a pair of
long, moth-eaten curtains, behind which Harry supposed there must
be another door, and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked
as though it had been made from a severed troll’s leg, they started up
the dark staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on

61
CHAPTER FOUR
plaques on the wall. A closer look showed Harry that the heads be-
longed to house-elves. All of them had the same rather snoutlike nose.
Harry’s bewilderment deepened with every step he took. What on
earth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to
the Darkest of wizards?
“Mrs. Weasley, why — ?”
“Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I’ve really got to
dash,” Mrs. Weasley whispered distractedly. “There” — they had
reached the second landing — “you’re the door on the right. I’ll call
you when it’s over.”
And she hurried off downstairs again.
Harry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom doorknob,
which was shaped like a serpent’s head, and opened the door.
He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded
room, then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even
louder shriek, and his vision was completely obscured by a large quan-
tity of very bushy hair — Hermione had thrown herself onto him in a
hug that nearly knocked him flat, while Ron’s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon,
zoomed excitedly round and round their heads.
“HARRY! Ron, he’s here, Harry’s here! We didn’t hear you arrive!
Oh, how are you? Are you all right? Have you been furious with us? I
bet you have, I know our letters were useless — but we couldn’t tell
you anything, Dumbledore made us swear we wouldn’t, oh, we’ve got
so much to tell you, and you’ve got to tell us — the dementors! When
we heard — and that Ministry hearing — it’s just outrageous, I’ve
looked it all up, they can’t expel you, they just can’t, there’s provision
in the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of
magic in life-threatening situations —”
“Let him breathe, Hermione,” said Ron, grinning, closing the door
behind Harry. He seemed to have grown several more inches during
their month apart, making him taller and more gangly looking than
ever, though the long nose, bright red hair, and freckles were the same.

62
NUMBER TWELVE,
GRIMMAULD PLACE
Hermione, still beaming, let go of Harry, but before she could say
another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white
soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on Harry’s
shoulder.
“Hedwig!”
The snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately
as Harry stroked her feathers.
“She’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “Pecked us half to death
when she brought your last letters, look at this —”
He showed Harry the index finger of his right hand, which sported
a half-healed but clearly deep cut.
“Oh yeah,” Harry said. “Sorry about that, but I wanted answers,
you know. . . .”
“We wanted to give them to you, mate,” said Ron. “Hermione was
going spare, she kept saying you’d do something stupid if you were
stuck all on your own without news, but Dumbledore made us —”
“— swear not to tell me,” said Harry. “Yeah, Hermione’s already
said.”
The warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two
best friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his
stomach. All of a sudden — after yearning to see them for a solid
month — he felt he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone.
There was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig auto-
matically, not looking at either of the others.
“He seemed to think it was best,” said Hermione rather breath-
lessly. “Dumbledore, I mean.”
“Right,” said Harry. He noticed that her hands too bore the marks
of Hedwig’s beak and found that he was not at all sorry.
“I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles —” Ron
began.
“Yeah?” said Harry, raising his eyebrows. “Have either of you been
attacked by dementors this summer?”

63
CHAPTER FOUR
“Well, no — but that’s why he’s had people from the Order of the
Phoenix tailing you all the time —”
Harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a step
going downstairs. So everyone had known he was being followed ex-
cept him.
“Didn’t work that well, though, did it?” said Harry, doing his
utmost to keep his voice even. “Had to look after myself after all,
didn’t I?”
“He was so angry,” said Hermione in an almost awestruck voice.
“Dumbledore. We saw him. When he found out Mundungus had left
before his shift had ended. He was scary.”
“Well, I’m glad he left,” Harry said coldly. “If he hadn’t, I wouldn’t
have done magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at
Privet Drive all summer.”
“Aren’t you . . . aren’t you worried about the Ministry of Magic
hearing?” said Hermione quietly.
“No,” Harry lied defiantly. He walked away from them, looking
around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder, but this
room was not likely to raise his spirits. It was dank and dark. A blank
stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the
bareness of the peeling walls and as Harry passed it he thought he
heard someone lurking out of sight snigger.
“So why’s Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark?”
Harry asked, still trying hard to keep his voice casual. “Did you —
er — bother to ask him at all?”
He glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told
him he was behaving just as they had feared he would. It did nothing
to improve his temper.
“We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on,”
said Ron. “We did, mate. But he’s really busy now, we’ve only seen
him twice since we came here and he didn’t have much time, he just

64

made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, he said
the owls might be intercepted —”
“He could still’ve kept me informed if he’d wanted to,” Harry said
shortly. “You’re not telling me he doesn’t know ways to send messages
without owls.”
Hermione glanced at Ron and then said, “I thought that too. But
he didn’t want you to know anything.”
“Maybe he thinks I can’t be trusted,” said Harry, watching their ex-
pressions.
“Don’t be thick,” said Ron, looking highly disconcerted.
“Or that I can’t take care of myself —”
“Of course he doesn’t think that!” said Hermione anxiously.
“So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys’ while you two get to
join in everything that’s going on here?” said Harry, the words tum-
bling over one another in a rush, his voice growing louder with every
word. “How come you two are allowed to know everything that’s go-
ing on — ?”
“We’re not!” Ron interrupted. “Mum won’t let us near the meet-
ings, she says we’re too young —”
But before he knew it, Harry was shouting.
“SO YOU HAVEN’T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG DEAL!
YOU’VE STILL BEEN HERE, HAVEN’T YOU? YOU’VE STILL
BEEN TOGETHER! ME, I’VE BEEN STUCK AT THE DURS-
LEYS’ FOR A MONTH! AND I’VE HANDLED MORE THAN
YOU TWO’VE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE
KNOWS IT — WHO SAVED THE SORCERER’S STONE?
WHO GOT RID OF RIDDLE? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR
SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS?”
Every bitter and resentful thought that Harry had had in the past
month was pouring out of him; his frustration at the lack of news, the
hurt that they had all been together without him, his fury at being

CHAPTER FOUR
followed and not told about it: All the feelings he was half-ashamed of
finally burst their boundaries. Hedwig took fright at the noise and
soared off on top of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon twittered in
alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads.
“WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES
AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR? WHO SAW
HIM COME BACK? WHO HAD TO ESCAPE FROM HIM? ME!”
Ron was standing there with his mouth half-open, clearly stunned
and at a loss for anything to say, while Hermione looked on the verge
of tears.
“BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON? WHY
SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO TELL ME WHAT’S BEEN
HAPPENING?”
“Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did —” Hermione began.
“CAN’T’VE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR
YOU’D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT DUMBLEDORE
MADE YOU SWEAR —”
“Well, he did —”
“FOUR WEEKS I’VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE,
NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT
WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON —”
“We wanted to —”
“I SUPPOSE YOU’VE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH,
HAVEN’T YOU, ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER —”
“No, honest —”
“Harry, we’re really sorry!” said Hermione desperately, her eyes now
sparkling with tears. “You’re absolutely right, Harry — I’d be furious
if it was me!”
Harry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from
them again, pacing up and down. Hedwig hooted glumly from the
top of the wardrobe. There was a long pause, broken only by the
mournful creak of the floorboards below Harry’s feet.

“What is this place anyway?” he shot at Ron and Hermione.
“Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,” said Ron at once.
“Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the
Phoenix — ?”
“It’s a secret society,” said Hermione quickly. “Dumbledore’s in
charge, he founded it. It’s the people who fought against You-Know-
Who last time.”
“Who’s in it?” said Harry, coming to a halt with his hands in his
pockets.
“Quite a few people —”
“— we’ve met about twenty of them,” said Ron, “but we think
there are more. . . .”
Harry glared at them.
“Well?” he demanded, looking from one to the other.
“Er,” said Ron. “Well what?”
“Voldemort!” said Harry furiously, and both Ron and Hermione
winced. “What’s happening? What’s he up to? Where is he? What are
we doing to stop him?”
“We’ve told you, the Order don’t let us in on their meetings,” said
Hermione nervously. “So we don’t know the details — but we’ve got a
general idea —” she added hastily, seeing the look on Harry’s face.
“Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see,” said Ron.
“They’re really useful.”
“Extendable — ?”
“Ears, yeah. Only we’ve had to stop using them lately because
Mum found out and went berserk. Fred and George had to hide them
all to stop Mum binning them. But we got a good bit of use out of
them before Mum realized what was going on. We know some of the
Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you
know —”
“— some of them are working on recruiting more people to the
Order —” said Hermione.


CHAPTER FOUR
“— and some of them are standing guard over something,” said
Ron. “They’re always talking about guard duty.”
“Couldn’t have been me, could it?” said Harry sarcastically.
“Oh yeah,” said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension.
Harry snorted. He walked around the room again, looking any-
where but at Ron and Hermione. “So what have you two been doing,
if you’re not allowed in meetings?” he demanded. “You said you’d
been busy.”
“We have,” said Hermione quickly. “We’ve been decontaminating
this house, it’s been empty for ages and stuff ’s been breeding in here.
We’ve managed to clean out the kitchen, most of the bedrooms, and I
think we’re doing the drawing room tomo — AARGH!”
With two loud cracks, Fred and George, Ron’s elder twin brothers,
had materialized out of thin air in the middle of the room. Pigwidg-
eon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join Hedwig
on top of the wardrobe.
“Stop doing that!” Hermione said weakly to the twins, who were as
vividly red-haired as Ron, though stockier and slightly shorter.
“Hello, Harry,” said George, beaming at him. “We thought we
heard your dulcet tones.”
“You don’t want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all
out,” said Fred, also beaming. “There might be a couple of people fifty
miles away who didn’t hear you.”
“You two passed your Apparation tests, then?” asked Harry
grumpily.
“With distinction,” said Fred, who was holding what looked like a
piece of very long, flesh-colored string.
“It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down
the stairs,” said Ron.
“Time is Galleons, little brother,” said Fred. “Anyway, Harry, you’re
interfering with reception. Extendable Ears,” he added in response to

68
NUMBER TWELVE,
GRIMMAULD PLACE
Harry’s raised eyebrows, holding up the string, which Harry now saw
was trailing out onto the landing. “We’re trying to hear what’s going
on downstairs.”
“You want to be careful,” said Ron, staring at the ear. “If Mum sees
one of them again . . .”
“It’s worth the risk, that’s a major meeting they’re having,” said
Fred.
The door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared.
“Oh hello, Harry!” said Ron’s younger sister, Ginny, brightly. “I
thought I heard your voice.”
Turning to Fred and George she said, “It’s no go with the Extend-
able Ears, she’s gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen
door.”
“How d’you know?” said George, looking crestfallen.
“Tonks told me how to find out,” said Ginny. “You just chuck stuff
at the door and if it can’t make contact the door’s been Imperturbed.
I’ve been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they
just soar away from it, so there’s no way the Extendable Ears will be
able to get under the gap.”
Fred heaved a deep sigh. “Shame. I really fancied finding out what
old Snape’s been up to.”
“Snape?” said Harry quickly. “Is he here?”
“Yeah,” said George, carefully closing the door and sitting down on
one of the beds; Fred and Ginny followed. “Giving a report. Top
secret.”
“Git,” said Fred idly.
“He’s on our side now,” said Hermione reprovingly.
Ron snorted. “Doesn’t stop him being a git. The way he looks at us
when he sees us. . . .”
“Bill doesn’t like him either,” said Ginny, as though that settled the
matter.

69
CHAPTER FOUR
Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his thirst for
information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting. He sank
onto the bed opposite the others.
“Is Bill here?” he asked. “I thought he was working in Egypt.”
“He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the
Order,” said Fred. “He says he misses the tombs, but,” he smirked,
“there are compensations. . . .”
“What d’you mean?”
“Remember old Fleur Delacour?” said George. “She’s got a job at
Gringotts to eemprove ’er Eeenglish —”
“— and Bill’s been giving her a lot of private lessons,” sniggered
Fred.
“Charlie’s in the Order too,” said George, “but he’s still in Romania,
Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so
Charlie’s trying to make contacts on his days off.”
“Couldn’t Percy do that?” Harry asked. The last he had heard, the
third Weasley brother was working in the Department of Interna-
tional Magical Cooperation at the Ministry of Magic.
At these words all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly
significant looks.
“Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of Mum and
Dad,” Ron told Harry in a tense voice.
“Why not?”
“Because every time Percy’s name’s mentioned, Dad breaks what-
ever he’s holding and Mum starts crying,” Fred said.
“It’s been awful,” said Ginny sadly.
“I think we’re well shut of him,” said George with an uncharacter-
istically ugly look on his face.
“What’s happened?” Harry said.
“Percy and Dad had a row,” said Fred. “I’ve never seen Dad row
with anyone like that. It’s normally Mum who shouts. . . .”
“It was the first week back after term ended,” said Ron. “We were

70
NUMBER TWELVE,
GRIMMAULD PLACE
about to come and join the Order. Percy came home and told us he’d
been promoted.”
“You’re kidding?” said Harry.
Though he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious,
Harry’s impression was that Percy had not made a great success of his
first job at the Ministry of Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large
oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by
Lord Voldemort (not that the Ministry had believed that — they all
thought that Mr. Crouch had gone mad).
“Yeah, we were all surprised,” said George, “because Percy got into
a load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything.
They said Percy ought to have realized Crouch was off his rocker and
informed a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left him in charge,
he wasn’t going to complain. . . .”
“So how come they promoted him?”
“That’s exactly what we wondered,” said Ron, who seemed very
keen to keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped
yelling. “He came home really pleased with himself — even more
pleased than usual if you can imagine that — and told Dad he’d been
offered a position in Fudge’s own office. A really good one for some-
one only a year out of Hogwarts — Junior Assistant to the Minister.
He expected Dad to be all impressed, I think.”
“Only Dad wasn’t,” said Fred grimly.
“Why not?” said Harry.
“Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry
checking that nobody’s having any contact with Dumbledore,” said
George.
“Dumbledore’s name’s mud with the Ministry these days, see,” said
Fred. “They all think he’s just making trouble saying You-Know-
Who’s back.”
“Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who’s in league with
Dumbledore can clear out their desks,” said George.

71
CHAPTER FOUR
“Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he’s friendly with Dum-
bledore, and he’s always thought Dad’s a bit of a weirdo because of his
Muggle obsession —”
“But what’s this got to do with Percy?” asked Harry, confused.
“I’m coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his
office because he wants to use him to spy on the family — and
Dumbledore.”
Harry let out a low whistle.
“Bet Percy loved that.”
Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way.
“He went completely berserk. He said — well, he said loads of ter-
rible stuff. He said he’s been having to struggle against Dad’s lousy
reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad’s got no
ambition and that’s why we’ve always been — you know — not had a
lot of money, I mean —”
“What?” said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an an-
gry cat.
“I know,” said Ron in a low voice. “And it got worse. He said Dad
was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was
heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and
that he — Percy — knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the
Ministry. And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the
Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he didn’t belong
to our family anymore. And he packed his bags the same night and
left. He’s living here in London now.”
Harry swore under his breath. He had always liked Percy least of
Ron’s brothers, but he had never imagined he would say such things
to Mr. Weasley.
“Mum’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “You know — crying and
stuff. She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed
the door in her face. I dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work —
ignores him, I s’pose.”

72
NUMBER TWELVE,
GRIMMAULD PLACE
“But Percy must know Voldemort’s back,” said Harry slowly. “He’s
not stupid, he must know your mum and dad wouldn’t risk every-
thing without proof —”
“Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,” said Ron, shoot-
ing Harry a furtive look. “Percy said the only evidence was your word
and . . . I dunno . . . he didn’t think it was good enough.”
“Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously,” said Hermione tartly, and
the others all nodded.
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked, looking around at
them all. They were all regarding him warily.
“Haven’t — haven’t you been getting the Daily Prophet?” Hermi-
one asked nervously.
“Yeah, I have!” said Harry.
“Have you — er — been reading it thoroughly?” Hermione asked
still more anxiously.
“Not cover to cover,” said Harry defensively. “If they were going
to report anything about Voldemort it would be headline news,
wouldn’t it!”
The others flinched at the sound of the name. Hermione hurried
on, “Well, you’d need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but
they — um — they mention you a couple of times a week.”
“But I’d have seen —”
“Not if you’ve only been reading the front page, you wouldn’t,” said
Hermione, shaking her head. “I’m not talking about big articles. They
just slip you in, like you’re a standing joke.”
“What d’you — ?”
“It’s quite nasty, actually,” said Hermione in a voice of forced calm.
“They’re just building on Rita’s stuff.”
“But she’s not writing for them anymore, is she?”
“Oh no, she’s kept her promise — not that she’s got any choice,”
Hermione added with satisfaction. “But she laid the foundation for
what they’re trying to do now.”

73
CHAPTER FOUR
“Which is what?” said Harry impatiently.
“Okay, you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the
place and saying your scar was hurting and all that?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita Skeeter’s sto-
ries about him in a hurry.
“Well, they’re writing about you as though you’re this deluded,
attention-seeking person who thinks he’s a great tragic hero or some-
thing,” said Hermione, very fast, as though it would be less unpleasant
for Harry to hear these facts quickly. “They keep slipping in snide
comments about you. If some far-fetched story appears they say some-
thing like ‘a tale worthy of Harry Potter’ and if anyone has a funny
accident or anything it’s ‘let’s hope he hasn’t got a scar on his forehead
or we’ll be asked to worship him next —’ ”
“I don’t want anyone to worship —” Harry began hotly.
“I know you don’t,” said Hermione quickly, looking frightened.
“I know, Harry. But you see what they’re doing? They want to turn
you into someone nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, I’ll bet
anything. They want wizards on the street to think you’re just some
stupid boy who’s a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous tall stories because
he loves being famous and wants to keep it going.”
“I didn’t ask — I didn’t want — Voldemort killed my parents!”
Harry spluttered. “I got famous because he murdered my family but
couldn’t kill me! Who wants to be famous for that? Don’t they think
I’d rather it’d never —”
“We know, Harry,” said Ginny earnestly.
“And of course, they didn’t report a word about the dementors at-
tacking you,” said Hermione. “Someone’s told them to keep that
quiet. That should’ve been a really big story, out-of-control demen-
tors. They haven’t even reported that you broke the International
Statute of Secrecy — we thought they would, it would tie in so well
with this image of you as some stupid show-off — we think they’re

biding their time until you’re expelled, then they’re really going to go
to town — I mean, if you’re expelled, obviously,” she went on hastily,
“you really shouldn’t be, not if they abide by their own laws, there’s no
case against you.”
They were back on the hearing and Harry did not want to think
about it. He cast around for another change of subject, but was saved
the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the
stairs.
“Uh-oh.”
Fred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was another loud
crack and he and George vanished. Seconds later, Mrs. Weasley ap-
peared in the bedroom doorway.
“The meeting’s over, you can come down and have dinner now,
everyone’s dying to see you, Harry. And who’s left all those Dung-
bombs outside the kitchen door?”
“Crookshanks,” said Ginny unblushingly. “He loves playing with
them.”
“Oh,” said Mrs. Weasley, “I thought it might have been Kreacher,
he keeps doing odd things like that. Now don’t forget to keep your
voices down in the hall. Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you
been doing? Go and wash them before dinner, please. . . .”
Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the
room, leaving Harry alone with Ron and Hermione again. Both of
them were watching him apprehensively, as though they feared that he
would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone. The sight
of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed.
“Look . . .” he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Hermione
said quietly, “We knew you’d be angry, Harry, we really don’t blame
you, but you’ve got to understand, we did try and persuade Dumble-
dore —”
“Yeah, I know,” said Harry grudgingly.

75
CHAPTER FOUR
He cast around for a topic to change the subject from Dumble-
dore — the very thought of him made Harry’s insides burn with
anger again.
“Who’s Kreacher?” he asked.
“The house-elf who lives here,” said Ron. “Nutter. Never met one
like him.”
Hermione frowned at Ron.
“He’s not a nutter, Ron —”
“His life’s ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a
plaque just like his mother,” said Ron irritably. “Is that normal,
Hermione?”
“Well — well, if he is a bit strange, it’s not his fault —”
Ron rolled his eyes at Harry.
“Hermione still hasn’t given up on spew —”
“It’s not ‘spew’!” said Hermione heatedly. “It’s the Society for the
Promotion of Elfish Welfare, and it’s not just me, Dumbledore says we
should be kind to Kreacher too —”
“Yeah, yeah,” said Ron. “C’mon, I’m starving.”
He led the way out of the door and onto the landing, but before
they could descend the stairs — “Hold it!” Ron breathed, flinging out
an arm to stop Harry and Hermione walking any farther. “They’re
still in the hall, we might be able to hear something —”
The three of them looked cautiously over the banisters. The gloomy
hallway below was packed with witches and wizards, including all of
Harry’s guard. They were whispering excitedly together. In the very
center of the group Harry saw the dark, greasy-haired head and promi-
nent nose of his least favorite teacher at Hogwarts, Professor Snape.
Harry leaned farther over the banisters. He was very interested in what
Snape was doing for the Order of the Phoenix. . . .
A thin piece of flesh-colored string descended in front of Harry’s
eyes. Looking up he saw Fred and George on the landing above, cau-
tiously lowering the Extendable Ear toward the dark knot of people

76
NUMBER TWELVE,
GRIMMAULD PLACE
below. A moment later, however, they began to move toward the front
door and out of sight.
“Dammit,” Harry heard Fred whisper, as he hoisted the Extendable
Ear back up again.
They heard the front door open and then close.
“Snape never eats here,” Ron told Harry quietly. “Thank God.
C’mon.”
“And don’t forget to keep your voice down in the hall, Harry,”
Hermione whispered.
As they passed the row of house-elf heads on the wall they saw
Lupin, Mrs. Weasley, and Tonks at the front door, magically sealing its
many locks and bolts behind those who had just left.
“We’re eating down in the kitchen,” Mrs. Weasley whispered,
meeting them at the bottom of the stairs. “Harry, dear, if you’ll just
tiptoe across the hall, it’s through this door here —”
CRASH.
“Tonks!” cried Mrs. Weasley exasperatedly, turning to look behind
her.
“I’m sorry!” wailed Tonks, who was lying flat on the floor. “It’s that
stupid umbrella stand, that’s the second time I’ve tripped over —”
But the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible, earsplitting,
bloodcurdling screech.
The moth-eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed earlier had flown
apart, but there was no door behind them. For a split second, Harry
thought he was looking through a window, a window behind which
an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though
she was being tortured — then he realized it was simply a life-size por-
trait, but the most realistic, and the most unpleasant, he had ever seen
in his life.
The old woman was drooling, her eyes were rolling, the yellowing
skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed, and all along the hall
behind them, the other portraits awoke and began to yell too, so that

77
CHAPTER FOUR
Harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands
over his ears.
Lupin and Mrs. Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the cur-
tains shut over the old woman, but they would not close and she
screeched louder than ever, brandishing clawed hands as though try-
ing to tear at their faces.
“Filth! Scum! By-products of dirt and vileness! Half-breeds, mutants,
freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my
fathers —”
Tonks apologized over and over again, at the same time dragging
the huge, heavy troll’s leg back off the floor. Mrs. Weasley abandoned
the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall,
Stunning all the other portraits with her wand. Then a man with long
black hair came charging out of a door facing Harry.
“Shut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!” he roared, seizing the
curtain Mrs. Weasley had abandoned.
The old woman’s face blanched.
“Yoooou!” she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of the man.
“Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!”
“I said — shut — UP!” roared the man, and with a stupendous ef-
fort he and Lupin managed to force the curtains closed again.
The old woman’s screeches died and an echoing silence fell.
Panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes,
Harry’s godfather, Sirius, turned to face him.
“Hello, Harry,” he said grimly, “I see you’ve met my mother.”

our — ?”
“My dear old mum, yeah,” said Sirius. “We’ve been trying
to get her down for a month but we think she put a Permanent Stick-
ing Charm on the back of the canvas. Let’s get downstairs, quick,
before they all wake up again.”
“But what’s a portrait of your mother doing here?” Harry asked,
bewildered, as they went through the door from the hall and led the
way down a flight of narrow stone steps, the others just behind them.
“Hasn’t anyone told you? This was my parents’ house,” said Sirius.
“But I’m the last Black left, so it’s mine now. I offered it to Dumbledore
for headquarters — about the only useful thing I’ve been able to do.”
Harry, who had expected a better welcome, noted how hard and
bitter Sirius’s voice sounded. He followed his godfather to the bottom
of the stairs and through a door leading into the basement kitchen.
It was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above, a cavernous room
with rough stone walls. Most of the light was coming from a large fire
at the far end of the room. A haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like
battle fumes, through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy


CHAPTER FIVE
iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling. Many chairs had
been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long wooden table
stood in the middle of the room, littered with rolls of parchment, gob-
lets, empty wine bottles, and a heap of what appeared to be rags. Mr.
Weasley and his eldest son, Bill, were talking quietly with their heads
together at the end of the table.
Mrs. Weasley cleared her throat. Her husband, a thin, balding, red-
haired man, who wore horn-rimmed glasses, looked around and
jumped to his feet.
“Harry!” Mr. Weasley said, hurrying forward to greet him and
shaking his hand vigorously. “Good to see you!”
Over his shoulder Harry saw Bill, who still wore his long hair in a
ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table.
“Journey all right, Harry?” Bill called, trying to gather up twelve
scrolls at once. “Mad-Eye didn’t make you come via Greenland,
then?”
“He tried,” said Tonks, striding over to help Bill and immediately
sending a candle toppling onto the last piece of parchment. “Oh
no — sorry —”
“Here, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she re-
paired the parchment with a wave of her wand: In the flash of light
caused by Mrs. Weasley’s charm, Harry caught a glimpse of what
looked like the plan of a building.
Mrs. Weasley had seen him looking. She snatched the plan off the
table and stuffed it into Bill’s heavily laden arms.
“This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of
meetings,” she snapped before sweeping off toward an ancient dresser
from which she started unloading dinner plates.
Bill took out his wand, muttered “Evanesco!” and the scrolls
vanished.
“Sit down, Harry,” said Sirius. “You’ve met Mundungus, haven’t
you?”

80
THE ORDER OF
THE PHOENIX
The thing Harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged,
grunting snore and then jerked awake.
“Some’n say m’ name?” Mundungus mumbled sleepily. “I ’gree
with Sirius. . . .”
He raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting, his
droopy, bloodshot eyes unfocused. Ginny giggled.
“The meeting’s over, Dung,” said Sirius, as they all sat down
around him at the table. “Harry’s arrived.”
“Eh?” said Mundungus, peering balefully at Harry through his
matted ginger hair. “Blimey, so ’e ’as. Yeah . . . you all right, ’arry?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
Mundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets, still staring at
Harry, and pulled out a grimy black pipe. He stuck it in his mouth,
ignited the end of it with his wand, and took a deep pull on it. Great
billowing clouds of greenish smoke obscured him in seconds.
“Owe you a ’pology,” grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly
cloud.
“For the last time, Mundungus,” called Mrs. Weasley, “will you
please not smoke that thing in the kitchen, especially not when we’re
about to eat!”
“Ah,” said Mundungus. “Right. Sorry, Molly.”
The cloud of smoke vanished as Mundungus stowed his pipe back
in his pocket, but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered.
“And if you want dinner before midnight I’ll need a hand,” Mrs.
Weasley said to the room at large. “No, you can stay where you are,
Harry dear, you’ve had a long journey —”
“What can I do, Molly?” said Tonks enthusiastically, bounding for-
ward.
Mrs. Weasley hesitated, looking apprehensive.
“Er — no, it’s all right, Tonks, you have a rest too, you’ve done
enough today —”
“No, no, I want to help!” said Tonks brightly, knocking over a chair

81
CHAPTER FIVE
as she hurried toward the dresser from which Ginny was collecting
cutlery.
Soon a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of
their own accord, supervised by Mr. Weasley, while Mrs. Weasley
stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates,
more goblets, and food from the pantry. Harry was left at the table
with Sirius and Mundungus, who was still blinking mournfully at
him.
“Seen old Figgy since?” he asked.
“No,” said Harry, “I haven’t seen anyone.”
“See, I wouldn’t ’ave left,” said Mundungus, leaning forward, a
pleading note in his voice, “but I ’ad a business opportunity —”
Harry felt something brush against his knees and started, but it was
only Crookshanks, Hermione’s bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound
himself once around Harry’s legs, purring, then jumped onto Sirius’s
lap and curled up. Sirius scratched him absentmindedly behind the
ears as he turned, still grim-faced, to Harry.
“Had a good summer so far?”
“No, it’s been lousy,” said Harry.
For the first time, something like a grin flitted across Sirius’s face.
“Don’t know what you’re complaining about, myself.”
“What?” said Harry incredulously.
“Personally, I’d have welcomed a dementor attack. A deadly strug-
gle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely. You think
you’ve had it bad, at least you’ve been able to get out and about,
stretch your legs, get into a few fights. . . . I’ve been stuck inside for a
month.”
“How come?” asked Harry, frowning.
“Because the Ministry of Magic’s still after me, and Voldemort will
know all about me being an Animagus by now, Wormtail will have
told him, so my big disguise is useless. There’s not much I can do for
the Order of the Phoenix . . . or so Dumbledore feels.”

82
THE ORDER OF
THE PHOENIX
There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in
which Sirius uttered Dumbledore’s name that told Harry that Sirius
was not very happy with the headmaster either. Harry felt a sudden
upsurge of affection for his godfather.
“At least you’ve known what’s been going on,” he said bracingly.
“Oh yeah,” said Sirius sarcastically. “Listening to Snape’s reports,
having to take all his snide hints that he’s out there risking his life
while I’m sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time . . .
asking me how the cleaning’s going —”
“What cleaning?” asked Harry.
“Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,” said Sirius,
waving a hand around the dismal kitchen. “No one’s lived here for
ten years, not since my dear mother died, unless you count her old
house-elf, and he’s gone round the twist, hasn’t cleaned anything in
ages —”
“Sirius?” said Mundungus, who did not appear to have paid any
attention to this conversation, but had been minutely examining an
empty goblet. “This solid silver, mate?”
“Yes,” said Sirius, surveying it with distaste. “Finest fifteenth-
century goblin-wrought silver, embossed with the Black family crest.”
“That’d come off, though,” muttered Mundungus, polishing it
with his cuff.
“Fred — George — NO, JUST CARRY THEM!” Mrs. Weasley
shrieked.
Harry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked around and, a split second
later, dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a
large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy
wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air
toward them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a
halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden sur-
face, the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents
everywhere, and the bread knife slipped off the board and landed,

point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius’s right
hand had been seconds before.
“FOR HEAVEN’S SAKE!” screamed Mrs. Weasley. “THERE
WAS NO NEED — I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS — JUST BE-
CAUSE YOU’RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW YOU
DON’T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY
TINY LITTLE THING!”
“We were just trying to save a bit of time!” said Fred, hurrying for-
ward and wrenching the bread knife out of the table. “Sorry Sirius,
mate — didn’t mean to —”
Harry and Sirius were both laughing. Mundungus, who had top-
pled backward off his chair, was swearing as he got to his feet. Crook-
shanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser, from
whence his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness.
“Boys,” Mr. Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of
the table, “your mother’s right, you’re supposed to show a sense of re-
sponsibility now you’ve come of age —”
“— none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!” Mrs.
Weasley raged at the twins, slamming a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto
the table and spilling almost as much again. “Bill didn’t feel the need
to Apparate every few feet! Charlie didn’t Charm everything he met!
Percy —”
She stopped dead, catching her breath with a frightened look at her
husband, whose expression was suddenly wooden.
“Let’s eat,” said Bill quickly.
“It looks wonderful, Molly,” said Lupin, ladling stew onto a plate
for her and handing it across the table.
For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and
cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their
food. Then Mrs. Weasley turned to Sirius and said, “I’ve been mean-
ing to tell you, there’s something trapped in that writing desk in the
drawing room, it keeps rattling and shaking. Of course, it could just

84
THE ORDER OF
THE PHOENIX
be a boggart, but I thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at
it before we let it out.”
“Whatever you like,” said Sirius indifferently.
“The curtains in there are full of doxies too,” Mrs. Weasley went
on. “I thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow.”
“I look forward to it,” said Sirius. Harry heard the sarcasm in his
voice, but he was not sure that anyone else did.
Opposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by
transforming her nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each
time with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry’s
bedroom, her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance like Snape’s,
shrank to something resembling a button mushroom, and then
sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a
regular mealtime entertainment, because after a while Hermione and
Ginny started requesting their favorite noses.
“Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks . . .”
Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impression
that a female Dudley was grinning at him from across the table.
Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin were having an intense discussion
about goblins.
“They’re not giving anything away yet,” said Bill. “I still can’t work
out whether they believe he’s back or not. ’Course, they might prefer
not to take sides at all. Keep out of it.”
“I’m sure they’d never go over to You-Know-Who,” said Mr.
Weasley, shaking his head. “They’ve suffered losses too. Remember
that goblin family he murdered last time, somewhere near
Nottingham?”
“I think it depends what they’re offered,” said Lupin. “And I’m not
talking about gold; if they’re offered freedoms we’ve been denying
them for centuries they’re going to be tempted. Have you still not had
any luck with Ragnok, Bill?”
“He’s feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,” said Bill. “He

85
CHAPTER FIVE
hasn’t stopped raging about the Bagman business, he reckons the
Ministry did a cover-up, those goblins never got their gold from him,
you know —”
A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of
Bill’s words. Fred, George, Ron, and Mundungus were rolling around
in their seats.
“. . . and then,” choked Mundungus, tears running down his face,
“and then, if you’ll believe it, ’e says to me, ’e says, ‘ ’ere, Dung, where
didja get all them toads from? ’Cos some son of a Bludger’s gone and
nicked all mine!’ And I says, ‘Nicked all your toads, Will, what next?
So you’ll be wanting some more, then?’ And if you’ll believe me, lads,
the gormless gargoyle buys all ’is own toads back orf me for twice what
’e paid in the first place —”
“I don’t think we need to hear any more of your business dealings,
thank you very much, Mundungus,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as
Ron slumped forward onto the table, howling with laughter.
“Beg pardon, Molly,” said Mundungus at once, wiping his eyes and
winking at Harry. “But, you know, Will nicked ’em orf Warty Harris
in the first place so I wasn’t really doing nothing wrong —”
“I don’t know where you learned about right and wrong, Mundun-
gus, but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons,” said Mrs.
Weasley coldly.
Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of butterbeer;
George was hiccuping. For some reason, Mrs. Weasley threw a very
nasty look at Sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large
rhubarb crumble for pudding. Harry looked round at his godfather.
“Molly doesn’t approve of Mundungus,” said Sirius in an
undertone.
“How come he’s in the Order?” Harry said very quietly.
“He’s useful,” Sirius muttered. “Knows all the crooks — well, he
would, seeing as he’s one himself. But he’s also very loyal to Dumble-

86
THE ORDER OF
THE PHOENIX
dore, who helped him out of a tight spot once. It pays to have some-
one like Dung around, he hears things we don’t. But Molly thinks
inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far. She hasn’t forgiven him
for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you.”
Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waist-
band on Harry’s jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was
saying something, as the jeans had once been Dudley’s). He lay down
his spoon in a lull in the general conversation. Mr. Weasley was lean-
ing back in his chair, looking replete and relaxed, Tonks was yawning
widely, her nose now back to normal, and Ginny, who had lured
Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on
the floor, rolling butterbeer corks for him to chase.
“Nearly time for bed, I think,” said Mrs. Weasley on a yawn.
“Not just yet, Molly,” said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and
turning to look at Harry. “You know, I’m surprised at you. I thought
the first thing you’d do when you got here would be to start asking
questions about Voldemort.”
The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry as-
sociated with the arrival of dementors. Where seconds before it had
been sleepily relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. A frisson had gone
around the table at the mention of Voldemort’s name. Lupin, who
had been about to take a sip of wine, lowered his goblet slowly, look-
ing wary.
“I did!” said Harry indignantly. “I asked Ron and Hermione but
they said we’re not allowed in the Order, so —”
“And they’re quite right,” said Mrs. Weasley. “You’re too young.”
She was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists clenched upon its
arms, every trace of drowsiness gone.
“Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to
ask questions?” asked Sirius. “Harry’s been trapped in that Muggle
house for a month. He’s got the right to know what’s been happen —”

87
CHAPTER FIVE
“Hang on!” interrupted George loudly.
“How come Harry gets his questions answered?” said Fred angrily.
“We’ve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you
haven’t told us a single stinking thing!” said George.
“ ‘You’re too young, you’re not in the Order,’ ” said Fred, in a high-
pitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mother’s. “Harry’s not
even of age!”
“It’s not my fault you haven’t been told what the Order’s doing,”
said Sirius calmly. “That’s your parents’ decision. Harry, on the other
hand —”
“It’s not down to you to decide what’s good for Harry!” said Mrs.
Weasley sharply. Her normally kindly face looked dangerous. “You
haven’t forgotten what Dumbledore said, I suppose?”
“Which bit?” Sirius asked politely, but with an air as though ready-
ing himself for a fight.
“The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know,” said
Mrs. Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words.
Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George’s heads turned from Sirius to
Mrs. Weasley as though following a tennis rally. Ginny was kneeling
amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks, watching the conversation
with her mouth slightly open. Lupin’s eyes were fixed on Sirius.
“I don’t intend to tell him more than he needs to know, Molly,” said
Sirius. “But as he was the one who saw Voldemort come back” (again,
there was a collective shudder around the table at the name), “he has
more right than most to —”
“He’s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!” said Mrs.
Weasley. “He’s only fifteen and —”
“— and he’s dealt with as much as most in the Order,” said Sirius,
“and more than some —”
“No one’s denying what he’s done!” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice ris-
ing, her fists trembling on the arms of her chair. “But he’s still —”
“He’s not a child!” said Sirius impatiently.

88
THE ORDER OF
THE PHOENIX
“He’s not an adult either!” said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her
cheeks. “He’s not James, Sirius!”
“I’m perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,” said Sirius coldly.
“I’m not sure you are!” said Mrs. Weasley. “Sometimes, the way you
talk about him, it’s as though you think you’ve got your best friend
back!”
“What’s wrong with that?” said Harry.
“What’s wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, however
much you might look like him!” said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes still bor-
ing into Sirius. “You are still at school and adults responsible for you
should not forget it!”
“Meaning I’m an irresponsible godfather?” demanded Sirius, his
voice rising.
“Meaning you’ve been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why
Dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and —”
“We’ll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of this, if you
please!” said Sirius loudly.
“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley, rounding on her husband. “Arthur,
back me up!”
Mr. Weasley did not speak at once. He took off his glasses and
cleaned them slowly on his robes, not looking at his wife. Only when
he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he say, “Dumbledore
knows the position has changed, Molly. He accepts that Harry will
have to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at head-
quarters —”
“Yes, but there’s a difference between that and inviting him to ask
whatever he likes!”
“Personally,” said Lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius at last, as
Mrs. Weasley turned quickly to him, hopeful that finally she was about
to get an ally, “I think it better that Harry gets the facts — not all the
facts, Molly, but the general picture — from us, rather than a garbled
version from . . . others.”

89
CHAPTER FIVE
His expression was mild, but Harry felt sure that Lupin, at least,
knew that some Extendable Ears had survived Mrs. Weasley’s purge.
“Well,” said Mrs. Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around
the table for support that did not come, “well . . . I can see I’m going
to be overruled. I’ll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his rea-
sons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as some-
one who has got Harry’s best interests at heart —”
“He’s not your son,” said Sirius quietly.
“He’s as good as,” said Mrs. Weasley fiercely. “Who else has he got?”
“He’s got me!”
“Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley, her lip curling. “The thing is, it’s been
rather difficult for you to look after him while you’ve been locked up
in Azkaban, hasn’t it?”
Sirius started to rise from his chair.
“Molly, you’re not the only person at this table who cares about
Harry,” said Lupin sharply. “Sirius, sit down.”
Mrs. Weasley’s lower lip was trembling. Sirius sank slowly back into
his chair, his face white.
“I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this,” Lupin continued.
“He’s old enough to decide for himself.”
“I want to know what’s been going on,” Harry said at once.
He did not look at Mrs. Weasley. He had been touched by what she
had said about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient at
her mollycoddling. . . . Sirius was right, he was not a child.
“Very well,” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice cracking. “Ginny —
Ron — Hermione — Fred — George — I want you out of this
kitchen, now.”
There was instant uproar.
“We’re of age!” Fred and George bellowed together.
“If Harry’s allowed, why can’t I?” shouted Ron.
“Mum, I want to!” wailed Ginny.

90
THE ORDER OF
THE PHOENIX
“NO!” shouted Mrs. Weasley, standing up, her eyes overbright. “I
absolutely forbid —”
“Molly, you can’t stop Fred and George,” said Mr. Weasley wearily.
“They are of age —”
“They’re still at school —”
“But they’re legally adults now,” said Mr. Weasley in the same tired
voice.
Mrs. Weasley was now scarlet in the face.
“I — oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but Ron —”
“Harry’ll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway!” said
Ron hotly. “Won’t — won’t you?” he added uncertainly, meeting
Harry’s eyes.
For a split second, Harry considered telling Ron that he wouldn’t
tell him a single word, that he could try a taste of being kept in the
dark and see how he liked it. But the nasty impulse vanished as they
looked at each other.
“ ’Course I will,” Harry said. Ron and Hermione beamed.
“Fine!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “Fine! Ginny — BED!”
Ginny did not go quietly. They could hear her raging and storming
at her mother all the way up the stairs, and when she reached the hall
Mrs. Black’s earsplitting shrieks were added to the din. Lupin hurried
off to the portrait to restore calm. It was only after he had returned,
closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table
again, that Sirius spoke.
“Okay, Harry . . . what do you want to know?”
Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had been ob-
sessing him for a month.
“Where’s Voldemort? What’s he doing? I’ve been trying to watch
the Muggle news,” he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces
at the name, “and there hasn’t been anything that looks like him yet,
no funny deaths or anything —”

91
CHAPTER FIVE
“That’s because there haven’t been any suspicious deaths yet,” said
Sirius, “not as far as we know, anyway. . . . And we know quite a lot.”
“More than he thinks we do anyway,” said Lupin.
“How come he’s stopped killing people?” Harry asked. He knew
that Voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone.
“Because he doesn’t want to draw attention to himself at the mo-
ment,” said Sirius. “It would be dangerous for him. His comeback
didn’t come off quite the way he wanted it to, you see. He messed it
up.”
“Or rather, you messed it up for him,” said Lupin with a satisfied
smile.
“How?” Harry asked perplexedly.
“You weren’t supposed to survive!” said Sirius. “Nobody apart from
his Death Eaters was supposed to know he’d come back. But you sur-
vived to bear witness.”
“And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the mo-
ment he got back was Dumbledore,” said Lupin. “And you made sure
Dumbledore knew at once.”
“How has that helped?” Harry asked.
“Are you kidding?” said Bill incredulously. “Dumbledore was the
only one You-Know-Who was ever scared of !”
“Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the
Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned,” said Sirius.
“So what’s the Order been doing?” said Harry, looking around at
them all.
“Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort can’t carry out
his plans,” said Sirius.
“How d’you know what his plans are?” Harry asked quickly.
“Dumbledore’s got a shrewd idea,” said Lupin, “and Dumbledore’s
shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.”
“So what does Dumbledore reckon he’s planning?”
“Well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,” said Sirius. “In

92
THE ORDER OF
THE PHOENIX
the old days he had huge numbers at his command; witches and wiz-
ards he’d bullied or bewitched into following him, his faithful Death
Eaters, a great variety of Dark creatures. You heard him planning to
recruit the giants; well, they’ll be just one group he’s after. He’s cer-
tainly not going to try and take on the Ministry of Magic with only a
dozen Death Eaters.”
“So you’re trying to stop him getting more followers?”
“We’re doing our best,” said Lupin.
“How?”
“Well, the main thing is to try and convince as many people as pos-
sible that You-Know-Who really has returned, to put them on their
guard,” said Bill. “It’s proving tricky, though.”
“Why?”
“Because of the Ministry’s attitude,” said Tonks. “You saw Cor-
nelius Fudge after You-Know-Who came back, Harry. Well, he hasn’t
shifted his position at all. He’s absolutely refusing to believe it’s
happened.”
“But why?” said Harry desperately. “Why’s he being so stupid? If
Dumbledore —”
“Ah, well, you’ve put your finger on the problem,” said Mr. Weasley
with a wry smile. “Dumbledore.”
“Fudge is frightened of him, you see,” said Tonks sadly.
“Frightened of Dumbledore?” said Harry incredulously.
“Frightened of what he’s up to,” said Mr. Weasley. “You see, Fudge
thinks Dumbledore’s plotting to overthrow him. He thinks Dumble-
dore wants to be Minister of Magic.”
“But Dumbledore doesn’t want —”
“Of course he doesn’t,” said Mr. Weasley. “He’s never wanted the
Minister’s job, even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when
Millicent Bagnold retired. Fudge came to power instead, but he’s
never quite forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore had,
even though Dumbledore never applied for the job.”

93
CHAPTER FIVE
“Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore’s much cleverer than he is,
a much more powerful wizard, and in the early days of his Ministry he
was forever asking Dumbledore for help and advice,” said Lupin. “But
it seems that he’s become fond of power now, and much more confi-
dent. He loves being Minister of Magic, and he’s managed to convince
himself that he’s the clever one and Dumbledore’s simply stirring up
trouble for the sake of it.”
“How can he think that?” said Harry angrily. “How can he think
Dumbledore would just make it all up — that I’d make it all up?”
“Because accepting that Voldemort’s back would mean trouble like
the Ministry hasn’t had to cope with for nearly fourteen years,” said
Sirius bitterly. “Fudge just can’t bring himself to face it. It’s so much
more comfortable to convince himself Dumbledore’s lying to destabi-
lize him.”
“You see the problem,” said Lupin. “While the Ministry insists
there is nothing to fear from Voldemort, it’s hard to convince people
he’s back, especially as they really don’t want to believe it in the first
place. What’s more, the Ministry’s leaning heavily on the Daily
Prophet not to report any of what they’re calling Dumbledore’s rumor-
mongering, so most of the Wizarding community are completely un-
aware anything’s happened, and that makes them easy targets for the
Death Eaters if they’re using the Imperius Curse.”
“But you’re telling people, aren’t you?” said Harry, looking around
at Mr. Weasley, Sirius, Bill, Mundungus, Lupin, and Tonks. “You’re
letting people know he’s back?”
They all smiled humorlessly.
“Well, as everyone thinks I’m a mad mass murderer and the Min-
istry’s put a ten-thousand-Galleon price on my head, I can hardly stroll
up the street and start handing out leaflets, can I?” said Sirius restlessly.
“And I’m not a very popular dinner guest with most of the commu-
nity,” said Lupin. “It’s an occupational hazard of being a werewolf.”

94
THE ORDER OF
THE PHOENIX
“Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they
started shooting their mouths off,” said Sirius, “and it’s very important
for us to have spies inside the Ministry, because you can bet Volde-
mort will have them.”
“We’ve managed to convince a couple of people, though,” said Mr.
Weasley. “Tonks here, for one — she’s too young to have been in the
Order of the Phoenix last time, and having Aurors on our side is a
huge advantage — Kingsley Shacklebolt’s been a real asset too. He’s in
charge of the hunt for Sirius, so he’s been feeding the Ministry infor-
mation that Sirius is in Tibet.”
“But if none of you’s putting the news out that Voldemort’s
back —” Harry began.
“Who said none of us was putting the news out?” said Sirius. “Why
d’you think Dumbledore’s in such trouble?”
“What d’you mean?” Harry asked.
“They’re trying to discredit him,” said Lupin. “Didn’t you see the
Daily Prophet last week? They reported that he’d been voted out of the
Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because
he’s getting old and losing his grip, but it’s not true, he was voted out
by Ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing Voldemort’s
return. They’ve demoted him from Chief Warlock on the Wizen-
gamot — that’s the Wizard High Court — and they’re talking about
taking away his Order of Merlin, First Class, too.”
“But Dumbledore says he doesn’t care what they do as long as they
don’t take him off the Chocolate Frog cards,” said Bill, grinning.
“It’s no laughing matter,” said Mr. Weasley shortly. “If he carries on
defying the Ministry like this, he could end up in Azkaban and the
last thing we want is Dumbledore locked up. While You-Know-Who
knows Dumbledore’s out there and wise to what he’s up to, he’s going
to go cautiously for a while. If Dumbledore’s out of the way — well,
You-Know-Who will have a clear field.”


CHAPTER FIVE
“But if Voldemort’s trying to recruit more Death Eaters, it’s bound
to get out that he’s come back, isn’t it?” asked Harry desperately.
“Voldemort doesn’t march up to people’s houses and bang on their
front doors, Harry,” said Sirius. “He tricks, jinxes, and blackmails
them. He’s well-practiced at operating in secrecy. In any case, gather-
ing followers is only one thing he’s interested in, he’s got other plans
too, plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed, and he’s con-
centrating on them at the moment.”
“What’s he after apart from followers?” Harry asked swiftly.
He thought he saw Sirius and Lupin exchange the most fleeting of
looks before Sirius said, “Stuff he can only get by stealth.”
When Harry continued to look puzzled, Sirius said, “Like a
weapon. Something he didn’t have last time.”
“When he was powerful before?”
“Yes.”
“Like what kind of weapon?” said Harry. “Something worse than
the Avada Kedavra — ?”
“That’s enough.”
Mrs. Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door. Harry had
not noticed her return from taking Ginny upstairs. Her arms were
crossed and she looked furious.
“I want you in bed, now. All of you,” she added, looking around at
Fred, George, Ron, and Hermione.
“You can’t boss us —” Fred began.
“Watch me,” snarled Mrs. Weasley. She was trembling slightly as
she looked at Sirius. “You’ve given Harry plenty of information. Any
more and you might just as well induct him into the Order
straightaway.”
“Why not?” said Harry quickly. “I’ll join, I want to join, I want to
fight —”
“No.”
It was not Mrs. Weasley who spoke this time, but Lupin.


“The Order is comprised only of overage wizards,” he said. “Wiz-
ards who have left school,” he added, as Fred and George opened their
mouths. “There are dangers involved of which you can have no idea,
any of you . . . I think Molly’s right, Sirius. We’ve said enough.”
Sirius half-shrugged but did not argue. Mrs. Weasley beckoned im-
periously to her sons and Hermione. One by one they stood up and
Harry, recognizing defeat, followed suit.

rs. Weasley followed them upstairs looking grim.
“I want you all to go straight to bed, no talking,” she
said as they reached the first landing. “We’ve got a busy day tomorrow.
I expect Ginny’s asleep,” she added to Hermione, “so try not to wake
her up.”
“Asleep, yeah, right,” said Fred in an undertone, after Hermione
bade them good night and they were climbing to the next floor. “If
Ginny’s not lying awake waiting for Hermione to tell her everything
they said downstairs, then I’m a flobberworm. . . .”
“All right, Ron, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley on the second landing,
pointing them into their bedroom. “Off to bed with you.”
“ ’Night,” Harry and Ron said to the twins.
“Sleep tight,” said Fred, winking.
Mrs. Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a sharp snap. The
bedroom looked, if anything, even danker and gloomier than it had
on first sight. The blank picture on the wall was now breathing very
slowly and deeply, as though its invisible occupant was asleep. Harry
put on his pajamas, took off his glasses, and climbed into his chilly


bed while Ron threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around and rustling
their wings restlessly.
“We can’t let them out to hunt every night,” Ron explained as he
pulled on his maroon pajamas. “Dumbledore doesn’t want too many
owls swooping around the square, thinks it’ll look suspicious. Oh
yeah . . . I forgot. . . .”
He crossed to the door and bolted it.
“What’re you doing that for?”
“Kreacher,” said Ron as he turned off the light. “First night I was
here he came wandering in at three in the morning. Trust me, you
don’t want to wake up and find him prowling around your room.
Anyway . . .” He got into his bed, settled down under the covers, then
turned to look at Harry in the darkness. Harry could see his outline
by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window. “What d’you
reckon?”
Harry didn’t need to ask what Ron meant.
“Well, they didn’t tell us much we couldn’t have guessed, did they?”
he said, thinking of all that had been said downstairs. “I mean, all
they’ve really said is that the Order’s trying to stop people joining
Vol —”
There was a sharp intake of breath from Ron.
“— demort,” said Harry firmly. “When are you going to start using
his name? Sirius and Lupin do.”
Ron ignored this last comment. “Yeah, you’re right,” he said. “We
already knew nearly everything they told us, from using the Extend-
able Ears. The only new bit was —”
Crack.
“OUCH!”
“Keep your voice down, Ron, or Mum’ll be back up here.”
“You two just Apparated on my knees!”
“Yeah, well, it’s harder in the dark —”

Harry saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George leaping down
from Ron’s bed. There was a groan of bedsprings and Harry’s mattress
descended a few inches as George sat down near his feet.
“So, got there yet?” said George eagerly.
“The weapon Sirius mentioned?” said Harry.
“Let slip, more like,” said Fred with relish, now sitting next to Ron.
“We didn’t hear about that on the old Extendables, did we?”
“What d’you reckon it is?” said Harry.
“Could be anything,” said Fred.
“But there can’t be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse,
can there?” said Ron. “What’s worse than death?”
“Maybe it’s something that can kill loads of people at once,” sug-
gested George.
“Maybe it’s some particularly painful way of killing people,” said
Ron fearfully.
“He’s got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,” said Harry. “He
doesn’t need anything more efficient than that.”
There was a pause and Harry knew that the others, like him, were
wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate.
“So who d’you thinks got it now?” asked George.
“I hope it’s our side,” said Ron, sounding slightly nervous.
“If it is, Dumbledore’s probably keeping it,” said Fred.
“Where?” said Ron quickly. “Hogwarts?”
“Bet it is!” said George. “That’s where he hid the Sorcerer’s Stone!”
“A weapon’s going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, though!” said
Ron.
“Not necessarily,” said Fred.
“Yeah, size is no guarantee of power,” said George. “Look at
Ginny.”
“What d’you mean?” said Harry.
“You’ve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey
Hexes, have you?”

“Shhh!” said Fred, half-rising from the bed. “Listen!”
They fell silent. Footsteps were coming up the stairs again.
“Mum,” said George, and without further ado there was a loud
crack and Harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed. A few
seconds later and they heard the floorboard creak outside their door;
Mrs. Weasley was plainly listening to see whether they were talking or
not.
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully. The floorboard creaked
again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and
George.
“She doesn’t trust us at all, you know,” said Ron regretfully.
Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had
been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie
awake for hours mulling it all over. He wanted to continue talking to
Ron, but Mrs. Weasley was now creaking back downstairs again, and
once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way up-
stairs. . . . In fact, many-legged creatures were cantering softly up and
down outside the bedroom door, and Hagrid, the Care of Magical
Creatures teacher, was saying, “Beauties, aren’ they, eh, Harry? We’ll be
studyin’ weapons this term. . . .” And Harry saw that the creatures had
cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him. . . . He ducked. . . .
The next thing he knew, he was curled in a warm ball under his
bedclothes, and George’s loud voice was filling the room.
“Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs
you in the drawing room, there are loads more doxies than she thought
and she’s found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa.”
Half an hour later, Harry and Ron, who had dressed and break-
fasted quickly, entered the drawing room, a long, high-ceilinged room
on the first floor with olive-green walls covered in dirty tapestries. The
carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot
on it and the long, moss-green velvet curtains were buzzing as though
swarming with invisible bees. It was around these that Mrs. Weasley,

101
CHAPTER SIX
Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and George were grouped, all looking rather
peculiar, as they had tied cloths over their noses and mouths. Each of
them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at
the end.
“Cover your faces and take a spray,” Mrs. Weasley said to Harry
and Ron the moment she saw them, pointing to two more bottles of
black liquid standing on a spindle-legged table. “It’s Doxycide. I’ve
never seen an infestation this bad — what that house-elf ’s been doing
for the last ten years —”
Hermione’s face was half concealed by a tea towel but Harry dis-
tinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at Mrs. Weasley at these
words.
“Kreacher’s really old, he probably couldn’t manage —”
“You’d be surprised what Kreacher can manage when he wants to,
Hermione,” said Sirius, who had just entered the room carrying a
bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats. “I’ve just been feed-
ing Buckbeak,” he added, in reply to Harry’s inquiring look. “I keep him
upstairs in my mother’s bedroom. Anyway . . . this writing desk . . .”
He dropped the bag of rats onto an armchair, then bent over to ex-
amine the locked cabinet which, Harry now noticed for the first time,
was shaking slightly.
“Well, Molly, I’m pretty sure this is a boggart,” said Sirius, peering
through the keyhole, “but perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a
shifty at it before we let it out — knowing my mother it could be
something much worse.”
“Right you are, Sirius,” said Mrs. Weasley.
They were both speaking in carefully light, polite voices that told
Harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of
the night before.
A loud, clanging bell sounded from downstairs, followed at once by
the cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previ-
ous night by Tonks knocking over the umbrella stand.


THE NOBLE AND MOST
ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK
“I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!” said Sirius exasperat-
edly, hurrying back out of the room. They heard him thundering
down the stairs as Mrs. Black’s screeches echoed up through the house
once more: “Stains of dishonor, filthy half-breeds, blood traitors, children
of filth . . .”
“Close the door, please, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley.
Harry took as much time as he dared to close the drawing room
door; he wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs. Sirius had
obviously managed to shut the curtains over his mother’s portrait be-
cause she had stopped screaming. He heard Sirius walking down the
hall, then the clattering of the chain on the front door, and then a
deep voice he recognized as Kingsley Shacklebolt’s saying, “Hestia’s
just relieved me, so she’s got Moody’s cloak now, thought I’d leave a re-
port for Dumbledore. . . .”
Feeling Mrs. Weasley’s eyes on the back of his head, Harry regret-
fully closed the drawing room door and rejoined the doxy party.
Mrs. Weasley was bending over to check the page on doxies in
Gilderoy Lockhart’s Guide to Household Pests, which was lying open on
the sofa.
“Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxies bite and
their teeth are poisonous. I’ve got a bottle of antidote here, but I’d
rather nobody needed it.”
She straightened up, positioned herself squarely in front of the cur-
tains, and beckoned them all forward.
“When I say the word, start spraying immediately,” she said.
“They’ll come flying out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one
good squirt will paralyze them. When they’re immobilized, just throw
them in this bucket.”
She stepped carefully out of their line of fire and raised her own
spray. “All right — squirt!”
Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fully grown
doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material, shiny beetlelike wings

103
CHAPTER SIX
whirring, tiny needle-sharp teeth bared, its fairylike body covered
with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury. Harry
caught it full in the face with a blast of Doxycide; it froze in midair
and fell, with a surprisingly loud thunk, onto the worn carpet below.
Harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket.
“Fred, what are you doing?” said Mrs. Weasley sharply. “Spray that
at once and throw it away!”
Harry looked around. Fred was holding a struggling doxy between
his forefinger and thumb.
“Right-o,” Fred said brightly, spraying the doxy quickly in the face
so that it fainted, but the moment Mrs. Weasley’s back was turned he
pocketed it with a wink.
“We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snack-
boxes,” George told Harry under his breath.
Deftly spraying two doxies at once as they soared straight for his
nose, Harry moved closer to George and muttered out of the corner
of his mouth, “What are Skiving Snackboxes?”
“Range of sweets to make you ill,” George whispered, keeping a
wary eye on Mrs. Weasley’s back. “Not seriously ill, mind, just ill
enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. Fred and I have
been developing them this summer. They’re double-ended, color-
coded chews. If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you
throw up. Moment you’ve been rushed out of the lesson for the hos-
pital wing, you swallow the purple half —”
“ ‘— which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the
leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would other-
wise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom.’ That’s what we’re
putting in the adverts, anyway,” whispered Fred, who had edged over
out of Mrs. Weasley’s line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray
doxies from the floor and adding them to his pocket. “But they still
need a bit of work. At the moment our testers are having a bit of trou-
ble stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple end.”


“Testers?”
“Us,” said Fred. “We take it in turns. George did the Fainting Fan-
cies — we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat —”
“Mum thought we’d been dueling,” said George.
“Joke shop still on, then?” Harry muttered, pretending to be ad-
justing the nozzle on his spray.
“Well, we haven’t had a chance to get premises yet,” said Fred,
dropping his voice even lower as Mrs. Weasley mopped her brow with
her scarf before returning to the attack, “so we’re running it as a mail-
order service at the moment. We put advertisements in the Daily
Prophet last week.”
“All thanks to you, mate,” said George. “But don’t worry . . . Mum
hasn’t got a clue. She won’t read the Daily Prophet anymore, ’cause of
it telling lies about you and Dumbledore.”
Harry grinned. He had forced the Weasley twins to take the thou-
sand-Galleon prize money he had won in the Triwizard Tournament
to help them realize their ambition to open a joke shop, but he was
still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown
to Mrs. Weasley, who did not think that running a joke shop was a
suitable career for two of her sons.
The de-doxying of the curtains took most of the morning. It was
past midday when Mrs. Weasley finally removed her protective scarf,
sank into a sagging armchair, and sprang up again with a cry of dis-
gust, having sat on the bag of dead rats. The curtains were no longer
buzzing; they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying; un-
conscious doxies lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them beside
a bowl of their black eggs, at which Crookshanks was now sniffing
and Fred and George were shooting covetous looks.
“I think we’ll tackle those after lunch.”
Mrs. Weasley pointed at the dusty glass-fronted cabinets standing
on either side of the mantelpiece. They were crammed with an odd
assortment of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled

105
CHAPTER SIX
snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages
Harry could not understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crys-
tal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper, full of what Harry was
quite sure was blood.
The clanging doorbell rang again. Everyone looked at Mrs. Weasley.
“Stay here,” she said firmly, snatching up the bag of rats as Mrs.
Blacks screeches started up again from down below. “I’ll bring up
some sandwiches.”
She left the room, closing the door carefully behind her. At once,
everyone dashed over to the window to look down onto the doorstep.
They could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of pre-
cariously balanced cauldrons.
“Mundungus!” said Hermione. “What’s he brought all those caul-
drons for?”
“Probably looking for a safe place to keep them,” said Harry. “Isn’t
that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me?
Picking up dodgy cauldrons?”
“Yeah, you’re right!” said Fred, as the front door opened; Mundun-
gus heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view.
“Blimey, Mum won’t like that. . . .”
He and George crossed to the door and stood beside it, listening
intently. Mrs. Black’s screaming had stopped again.
“Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,” Fred muttered,
frowning with concentration. “Can’t hear properly . . . d’you reckon
we can risk the Extendable Ears?”
“Might be worth it,” said George. “I could sneak upstairs and get a
pair —”
But at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from
downstairs that rendered Extendable Ears quite unnecessary. All of
them could hear exactly what Mrs. Weasley was shouting at the top of
her voice.

106
THE NOBLE AND MOST
ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK
“WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN
GOODS!”
“I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,” said Fred, with a
satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow
Mrs. Weasley’s voice to permeate the room better. “It makes such a
nice change.”
“— COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVEN’T
GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAG-
GING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE —”
“The idiots are letting her get into her stride,” said George, shaking
his head. “You’ve got to head her off early, otherwise she builds up a
head of steam and goes on for hours. And she’s been dying to have a
go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to
be following you, Harry — and there goes Sirius’s mum again —”
Mrs. Weasley’s voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from
the portraits in the hall. George made to shut the door to drown the
noise, but before he could do so, a house-elf edged into the room.
Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it
was completely naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several
times too big for it and though it was bald like all house-elves, there
was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its
eyes were a bloodshot and watery gray, and its fleshy nose was large
and rather snoutlike.
The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. Acting as
though it could not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and
doggedly, toward the far end of the room, muttering under its breath
all the while in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrog’s, “. . . Smells like
a drain and a criminal to boot, but she’s no better, nasty old blood
traitor with her brats messing up my Mistress’s house, oh my poor
Mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum they’ve let in her house,
what would she say to old Kreacher, oh the shame of it, Mudbloods

107
CHAPTER SIX
and werewolves and traitors and thieves, poor old Kreacher, what can
he do. . . .”
“Hello, Kreacher,” said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a
snap.
The house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, and then gave
a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise.
“Kreacher did not see Young Master,” he said, turning around and
bowing to Fred. Still facing the carpet, he added, perfectly audibly,
“Nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is.”
“Sorry?” said George. “Didn’t catch that last bit.”
“Kreacher said nothing,” said the elf, with a second bow to George,
adding in a clear undertone, “and there’s its twin, unnatural little
beasts they are.”
Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not. The elf straightened
up, eyeing them all very malevolently, and apparently convinced that
they could not hear him as he continued to mutter.
“. . . and there’s the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if
my Mistress knew, oh how she’d cry, and there’s a new boy, Kreacher
doesn’t know his name, what is he doing here, Kreacher doesn’t
know . . .”
“This is Harry, Kreacher,” said Hermione tentatively. “Harry
Potter.”
Kreacher’s pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furi-
ously than ever.
“The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend,
if Kreacher’s Mistress saw him in such company, oh what would she
say —”
“Don’t call her a Mudblood!” said Ron and Ginny together, very
angrily.
“It doesn’t matter,” Hermione whispered, “he’s not in his right
mind, he doesn’t know what he’s —”

108
THE NOBLE AND MOST
ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK
“Don’t kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he’s saying,”
said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike.
Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry.
“Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the scar, it must be
true, that’s that boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders
how he did it —”
“Don’t we all, Kreacher?” said Fred.
“What do you want anyway?” George asked.
Kreacher’s huge eyes darted onto George.
“Kreacher is cleaning,” he said evasively.
“A likely story,” said a voice behind Harry.
Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the door-
way. The noise in the hall had abated; perhaps Mrs. Weasley and
Mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen. At the
sight of Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that
flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor.
“Stand up straight,” said Sirius impatiently. “Now, what are you up
to?”
“Kreacher is cleaning,” the elf repeated. “Kreacher lives to serve the
noble house of Black —”
“— and it’s getting blacker every day, it’s filthy,” said Sirius.
“Master always liked his little joke,” said Kreacher, bowing again,
and continuing in an undertone, “Master was a nasty ungrateful swine
who broke his mother’s heart —”
“My mother didn’t have a heart, Kreacher,” Sirius snapped. “She
kept herself alive out of pure spite.”
Kreacher bowed again and said, “Whatever Master says,” then
muttered furiously, “Master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother’s
boots, oh my poor Mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher
serving him, how she hated him, what a disappointment he was —”
“I asked you what you were up to,” said Sirius coldly. “Every time

109
CHAPTER SIX
you show up pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to
your room so we can’t throw it out.”
“Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in
Master’s house,” said the elf, then muttered very fast, “Mistress would
never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries
it’s been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let
Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it —”
“I thought it might be that,” said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at
the opposite wall. “She’ll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm
on the back of it, I don’t doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will.
Now go away, Kreacher.”
It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order; never-
theless, the look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was redolent
of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room.
“— comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around, oh my
poor Mistress, what would she say if she saw the house now, scum liv-
ing in it, her treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers
and he’s back, they say he’s a murderer too —”
“Keep muttering and I will be a murderer!” said Sirius irritably, and
he slammed the door shut on the elf.
“Sirius, he’s not right in the head,” said Hermione pleadingly, “I
don’t think he realizes we can hear him.”
“He’s been alone too long,” said Sirius, “taking mad orders from
my mother’s portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul
little —”
“If you just set him free,” said Hermione hopefully, “maybe —”
“We can’t set him free, he knows too much about the Order,” said
Sirius curtly. “And anyway, the shock would kill him. You suggest to
him that he leaves this house, see how he takes it.”
Sirius walked across the room, where the tapestry Kreacher had
been trying to protect hung the length of the wall. Harry and the oth-
ers followed.

110
THE NOBLE AND MOST
ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK
The tapestry looked immensely old; it was faded and looked as
though doxies had gnawed it in places; nevertheless, the golden thread
with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show
them a sprawling family tree dating back (as far as Harry could tell) to
the Middle Ages. Large words at the very top of the tapestry read:
The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black
“Toujours Pur”
“You’re not on here!” said Harry, after scanning the bottom of the
tree.
“I used to be there,” said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred
hole in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn. “My sweet old mother
blasted me off after I ran away from home — Kreacher’s quite fond of
muttering the story under his breath.”
“You ran away from home?”
“When I was about sixteen,” said Sirius. “I’d had enough.”
“Where did you go?” asked Harry, staring at him.
“Your dad’s place,” said Sirius. “Your grandparents were really good
about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out
at your dad’s during the school holidays, and then when I was seven-
teen I got a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me a decent
bit of gold — he’s been wiped off here too, that’s probably why —
anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr.
and Mrs. Potter’s for Sunday lunch, though.”
“But . . . why did you . . . ?”
“Leave?” Sirius smiled bitterly and ran a hand through his long, un-
kempt hair. “Because I hated the whole lot of them: my parents, with
their pure-blood mania, convinced that to be a Black made you prac-
tically royal . . . my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them . . .
that’s him.”
Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, at the name

111
CHAPTER SIX
regulus black. A date of death (some fifteen years previously) fol-
lowed the date of birth.
“He was younger than me,” said Sirius, “and a much better son, as
I was constantly reminded.”
“But he died,” said Harry.
“Yeah,” said Sirius. “Stupid idiot . . . he joined the Death Eaters.”
“You’re kidding!”
“Come on, Harry, haven’t you seen enough of this house to tell
what kind of wizards my family were?” said Sirius testily.
“Were — were your parents Death Eaters as well?”
“No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right
idea, they were all for the purification of the Wizarding race, getting
rid of Muggle-borns and having purebloods in charge. They weren’t
alone either, there were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed
his true colors, who thought he had the right idea about things. . . .
They got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get
power, though. But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right lit-
tle hero for joining up at first.”
“Was he killed by an Auror?” Harry asked tentatively.
“Oh no,” said Sirius. “No, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on
Voldemort’s orders, more likely, I doubt Regulus was ever important
enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out
after he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being
asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you don’t just hand in your
resignation to Voldemort. It’s a lifetime of service or death.”
“Lunch,” said Mrs. Weasley’s voice.
She was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge
tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip. She was very red in
the face and still looked angry. The others moved over to her, eager for
some food, but Harry remained with Sirius, who had bent closer to
the tapestry.

112
THE NOBLE AND MOST
ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK
“I haven’t looked at this for years. There’s Phineas Nigellus . . . my
great-great-grandfather, see? Least popular headmaster Hogwarts ever
had . . . and Araminta Meliflua . . . cousin of my mother’s . . . tried to
force through a Ministry Bill to make Muggle-hunting legal . . . and
dear Aunt Elladora . . . she started the family tradition of beheading
house-elves when they got too old to carry tea trays . . . of course,
anytime the family produced someone halfway decent they were dis-
owned. I see Tonks isn’t on here. Maybe that’s why Kreacher won’t
take orders from her — he’s supposed to do whatever anyone in the
family asks him. . . .”
“You and Tonks are related?” Harry asked, surprised.
“Oh yeah, her mother, Andromeda, was my favorite cousin,” said
Sirius, examining the tapestry carefully. “No, Andromeda’s not on here
either, look —”
He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names,
Bellatrix and Narcissa.
“Andromeda’s sisters are still here because they made lovely, re-
spectable pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle-
born, Ted Tonks, so —”
Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly.
Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names
to the right of Andromeda’s burn mark. A double line of gold
embroidery linked Narcissa Black with Lucius Malfoy, and a single
vertical gold line from their names led to the name Draco.
“You’re related to the Malfoys!”
“The pure-blood families are all interrelated,” said Sirius. “If you’re
only going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods your
choice is very limited, there are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are
cousins by marriage and Arthur’s something like my second cousin
once removed. But there’s no point looking for them on here — if
ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors it’s the Weasleys.”

113
CHAPTER SIX
But Harry was now looking at the name to the left of Andromeda’s
burn: Bellatrix Black, which was connected by a double line to Rodol-
phus Lestrange.
“Lestrange . . .” Harry said aloud. The name had stirred something
in his memory; he knew it from somewhere, but for a moment he
couldn’t think where, though it gave him an odd, creeping sensation
in the pit of his stomach.
“They’re in Azkaban,” said Sirius shortly.
Harry looked at him curiously.
“Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch,
Junior,” said Sirius in the same brusque voice. “Rodolphus’s brother,
Rabastan, was with them too.”
And Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside
Dumbledore’s Pensieve, the strange device in which thoughts and
memories could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes,
who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to
Lord Voldemort, her pride that she had tried to find him after his
downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for
her loyalty.
“You never said she was your —”
“Does it matter if she’s my cousin?” snapped Sirius. “As far as I’m
concerned, they’re not my family. She’s certainly not my family. I
haven’t seen her since I was your age, unless you count a glimpse of her
coming in to Azkaban. D’you think I’m proud of having relatives like
her?”
“Sorry,” said Harry quickly, “I didn’t mean — I was just surprised,
that’s all —”
“It doesn’t matter, don’t apologize,” Sirius mumbled at once. He
turned away from the tapestry, his hands deep in his pockets. “I don’t
like being back here,” he said, staring across the drawing room. “I
never thought I’d be stuck in this house again.”
Harry understood completely. He knew how he would feel if

114
THE NOBLE AND MOST
ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK
forced, when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place
forever, to return and live at number four, Privet Drive.
“It’s ideal for headquarters, of course,” Sirius said. “My father put
every security measure known to Wizard-kind on it when he lived
here. It’s Unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call — as if
they’d have wanted to — and now Dumbledore’s added his protec-
tion, you’d be hard put to find a safer house anywhere. Dumbledore’s
Secret-Keeper for the Order, you know — nobody can find headquar-
ters unless he tells them personally where it is — that note Moody
showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore. . . .” Sirius gave a
short, barklike laugh. “If my parents could see the use it was being put
to now . . . well, my mother’s portrait should give you some idea. . . .”
He scowled for a moment, then sighed.
“I wouldn’t mind if I could just get out occasionally and do some-
thing useful. I’ve asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your
hearing — as Snuffles, obviously — so I can give you a bit of moral
support, what d’you think?”
Harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty
carpet. He had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the
previous evening; in the excitement of being back with the people he
liked best, of hearing everything that was going on, it had completely
flown his mind. At Sirius’s words, however, the crushing sense of
dread returned to him. He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all
tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if they
went back to Hogwarts without him.
“Don’t worry,” Sirius said. Harry looked up and realized that Sirius
had been watching him. “I’m sure they’re going to clear you, there’s
definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about be-
ing allowed to use magic to save your own life.”
“But if they do expel me,” said Harry, quietly, “can I come back
here and live with you?”
Sirius smiled sadly.

115
CHAPTER SIX
“We’ll see.”
“I’d feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn’t have to go
back to the Dursleys,” Harry pressed him.
“They must be bad if you prefer this place,” said Sirius gloomily.
“Hurry up, you two, or there won’t be any food left,” Mrs. Weasley
called.
Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at the tapestry,
and he and Harry went to join the others.
Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while they emp-
tied the glass cabinets that afternoon. Fortunately for him, it was a job
that required a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there
seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a
bad bite from a silver snuffbox; within seconds, his bitten hand had
developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove.
“It’s okay,” he said, examining the hand with interest before tap-
ping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal, “must
be Wartcap powder in there.”
He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing
the debris from the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap his own hand
carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already
doxy-filled pocket.
They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something
like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry’s arm
like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his
skin; Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled
Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box
that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all
found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy until Ginny
had the sense to slam the lid shut; also a heavy locket that none of
them could open, a number of ancient seals and, in a dusty box, an
Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius’s grand-
father for “Services to the Ministry.”

“It means he gave them a load of gold,” said Sirius contemptuously,
throwing the medal into the rubbish sack.
Several times, Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to
smuggle things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses
every time they caught him at it. When Sirius wrested a large golden
ring bearing the Black crest from his grip Kreacher actually burst into
furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling
Sirius names Harry had never heard before.
“It was my father’s,” said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack.
“Kreacher wasn’t quite as devoted to him as to my mother, but I still
caught him snogging a pair of my father’s old trousers last week.”
Mrs. Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days.
The drawing room took three days to decontaminate; finally the only
undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree,
which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall, and the
rattling writing desk; Moody had not dropped by headquarters yet, so
they could not be sure what was inside it.
They moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the
ground floor where they found spiders large as saucers lurking in the
dresser (Ron left the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not
return for an hour and a half). The china, which bore the Black crest
and motto, was all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by Sirius, and
the same fate met a set of old photographs in tarnished silver frames,
all of whose occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them
smashed.
Snape might refer to their work as “cleaning,” but in Harry’s opin-
ion they were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a
very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher. The house-elf kept
appearing wherever they were congregated, his muttering becoming
more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he
could from the rubbish sacks. Sirius went as far as to threaten him

117
CHAPTER SIX
with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said,
“Master must do as Master wishes,” before turning away and mutter-
ing very loudly, “but Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because
Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he is plotting against the
Dark Lord, yes, with these Mudbloods and traitors and scum. . . .”
At which Sirius, ignoring Hermione’s protests, seized Kreacher by
the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room.
The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the cue for Sirius’s
mother to start shrieking again, and for Harry and the others to at-
tempt to eavesdrop on the visitor, though they gleaned very little from
the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to
sneak before Mrs. Weasley recalled them to their tasks. Snape flitted in
and out of the house several times more, though to Harry’s relief they
never came face-to-face; he also caught sight of his Transfiguration
teacher, Professor McGonagall, looking very odd in a Muggle dress
and coat, though she also seemed too busy to linger.
Sometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help; Tonks joined them
for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old
ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the
house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious
work for the Order, helped them repair a grandfather clock that had
developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at passersby.
Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in Mrs. Weasley’s eyes by res-
cuing Ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to stran-
gle him when he removed them from their wardrobe.
Despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly, still having dreams
about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle, Harry
was managing to have fun for the first time all summer. As long as he
was busy he was happy; when the action abated, however, whenever
he dropped his guard, or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shad-
ows move across the ceiling, the thought of the looming Ministry

118
THE NOBLE AND MOST
ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK
hearing returned to him. Fear jabbed at his insides like needles as he
wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled. The
idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to
Ron and Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering to-
gether and casting anxious looks in his direction, followed his lead in
not mentioning it. Sometimes he could not prevent his imagination
showing him a faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand
in two and ordering him back to the Dursleys’ . . . but he would not
go. He was determined on that. He would come back here to Grim-
mauld Place and live with Sirius.
He felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when Mrs.
Weasley turned to him during dinner on Wednesday evening and said
quietly, “I’ve ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, Harry,
and I want you to wash your hair tonight too. A good first impression
can work wonders.”
Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny all stopped talking and
looked over at him. Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chops,
but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew.
“How am I getting there?” he asked Mrs. Weasley, trying to sound
unconcerned.
“Arthur’s taking you to work with him,” said Mrs. Weasley gently.
Mr. Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table.
“You can wait in my office until it’s time for the hearing,” he said.
Harry looked over at Sirius, but before he could ask the question,
Mrs. Weasley had answered it.
“Professor Dumbledore doesn’t think it’s a good idea for Sirius to
go with you, and I must say I —”
“— think he’s quite right,” said Sirius through clenched teeth.
Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips.
“When did Dumbledore tell you that?” Harry said, staring at
Sirius.

119
CHAPTER SIX
“He came last night, when you were in bed,” said Mr. Weasley.
Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork. Harry dropped his
own eyes to his plate. The thought that Dumbledore had been in the
house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him
feel, if that were possible, even worse.

H
arry awoke at half-past five the next morning as abruptly and
completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few
moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the hearing filled every
tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed
and put on his glasses. Mrs. Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered
jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his bed. Harry scrambled into them.
The blank picture on the wall sniggered again.
Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast
asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out onto
the landing, and closed the door softly behind him. Trying not to
think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer
be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs,
past the heads of Kreacher’s ancestors, and into the kitchen.
He had expected it to be empty, but it was not. When he reached
the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side and
when he pushed it open he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin,
and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him.

121
CHAPTER SEVEN
All were fully dressed except Mrs. Weasley, who was wearing a quilted,
purple dressing gown. She leapt to her feet the moment he entered.
“Breakfast,” she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to
the fire.
“M-m-morning, Harry,” yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and
curly this morning. “Sleep all right?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“I’ve b-b-been up all night,” she said, with another shuddering
yawn. “Come and sit down. . . .”
She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it in the process.
“What do you want, Harry?” Mrs. Weasley called. “Porridge?
Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?”
“Just — just toast, thanks,” said Harry.
Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, “What were you saying
about Scrimgeour?”
“Oh . . . yeah . . . well, we need to be a bit more careful, he’s been
asking Kingsley and me funny questions. . . .”
Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the
conversation. His insides were squirming. Mrs. Weasley placed a cou-
ple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat,
but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs. Weasley sat down on his other
side and started fussing with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and
smoothing out creases across the shoulders. He wished she wouldn’t.
“. . . and I’ll have to tell Dumbledore I can’t do night duty tomor-
row, I’m just t-t-too tired,” Tonks finished, yawning hugely again.
“I’ll cover for you,” said Mr. Weasley. “I’m okay, I’ve got a report to
finish anyway. . . .”
Mr. Weasley was not wearing wizard’s robes but a pair of pin-
striped trousers and an old bomber jacket. He turned from Tonks to
Harry.
“How are you feeling?”

122
THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
Harry shrugged.
“It’ll all be over soon,” Mr. Weasley said bracingly. “In a few hours’
time you’ll be cleared.”
Harry said nothing.
“The hearing’s on my floor, in Amelia Bones’s office. She’s Head of
the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and she’s the one who’ll
be questioning you.”
“Amelia Bones is okay, Harry,” said Tonks earnestly. “She’s fair,
she’ll hear you out.”
Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say.
“Don’t lose your temper,” said Sirius abruptly. “Be polite and stick
to the facts.”
Harry nodded again.
“The law’s on your side,” said Lupin quietly. “Even underage wiz-
ards are allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations.”
Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry’s neck; for a
moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm
on him again, then he realized that Mrs. Weasley was attacking his
hair with a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head.
“Doesn’t it ever lie flat?” she said desperately.
Harry shook his head.
Mr. Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry.
“I think we’ll go now,” he said. “We’re a bit early, but I think you’ll
be better off there than hanging around here.”
“Okay,” said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to
his feet.
“You’ll be all right, Harry,” said Tonks, patting him on the arm.
“Good luck,” said Lupin. “I’m sure it will be fine.”
“And if it’s not,” said Sirius grimly, “I’ll see to Amelia Bones for
you. . . .”
Harry smiled weakly. Mrs. Weasley hugged him.

123
CHAPTER SEVEN
“We’ve all got our fingers crossed,” she said.
“Right,” said Harry. “Well . . . see you later then.”
He followed Mr. Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He could hear
Sirius’s mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains. Mr. Weasley
unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold, gray dawn.
“You don’t normally walk to work, do you?” Harry asked him, as
they set off briskly around the square.
“No, I usually Apparate,” said Mr. Weasley, “but obviously you can’t,
and I think it’s best we arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion . . .
makes a better impression, given what you’re being disciplined for. . . .”
Mr. Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry
knew it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were
almost deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little Under-
ground station they found it already full of early morning commuters.
As ever when he found himself in close proximity to Muggles going
about their daily business, Mr. Weasley was hard put to contain his
enthusiasm.
“Simply fabulous,” he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket
machines. “Wonderfully ingenious.”
“They’re out of order,” said Harry, pointing at the sign.
“Yes, but even so . . .” said Mr. Weasley, beaming fondly at them.
They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard
(Harry handled the transaction, as Mr. Weasley was not very good
with Muggle money) and five minutes later they were boarding an
Underground train that rattled them off toward the center of London.
Mr. Weasley kept anxiously checking and rechecking the Under-
ground map above the windows.
“Four stops, Harry . . . three stops left now . . . two stops to go,
Harry . . .”
They got off at a station in the very heart of London, swept from
the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases. Up


the escalator they went, through the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley
delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged
onto a broad street lined with imposing-looking buildings, already
full of traffic.
“Where are we?” said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for one heart-
stopping moment Harry thought they had gotten off at the wrong sta-
tion despite Mr. Weasley’s continual references to the map; but a
second later he said, “Ah yes . . . this way, Harry,” and led him down
a side road.
“Sorry,” he said, “but I never come by train and it all looks rather
different from a Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact I’ve never
even used the visitor’s entrance before.”
The farther they walked, the smaller and less imposing the build-
ings became, until finally they reached a street that contained several
rather shabby-looking offices, a pub, and an overflowing dumpster.
Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry
of Magic.
“Here we are,” said Mr. Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red
telephone box, which was missing several panes of glass and stood be-
fore a heavily graffittied wall. “After you, Harry.”
He opened the telephone box door.
Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr.
Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door. It was a
tight fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which
was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to
rip it off. Mr. Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver.
“Mr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order too,” Harry said.
“No, no, I’m sure it’s fine,” said Mr. Weasley, holding the receiver
above his head and peering at the dial. “Let’s see . . . six . . .” he dialed
the number, “two . . . four . . . and another four . . . and another
two . . .”

125
CHAPTER SEVEN
As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice
sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr.
Weasley’s hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible
woman were standing right beside them.
“Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and
business.”
“Er . . .” said Mr. Weasley, clearly uncertain whether he should talk
into the receiver or not; he compromised by holding the mouthpiece
to his ear, “Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, here
to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary
hearing. . . .”
“Thank you,” said the cool female voice. “Visitor, please take the
badge and attach it to the front of your robes.”
There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out
of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked
it up: It was a square silver badge with Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hear-
ing on it. He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice
spoke again.
“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and
present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is lo-
cated at the far end of the Atrium.”
The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking
slowly into the ground. Harry watched apprehensively as the pave-
ment rose up past the glass windows of the telephone box until dark-
ness closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at all; he could
only hear a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way
down through the earth. After about a minute, though it felt much
longer to Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and,
widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the face and he had to
blink to stop his eyes from watering.
“The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,” said the
woman’s voice.

126
THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. Weasley
stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open.
They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a
highly polished, dark wood floor. The peacock-blue ceiling was inlaid
with gleaming golden symbols that were continually moving and chang-
ing like some enormous heavenly notice board. The walls on each side
were paneled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into
them. Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of
the left-hand fireplaces with a soft whoosh; on the right-hand side, short
queues of wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart.
Halfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of golden statues,
larger than life-size, stood in the middle of a circular pool. Tallest of
them all was a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight
up in the air. Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur,
a goblin, and a house-elf. The last three were all looking adoringly up
at the witch and wizard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the
ends of the two wands, the point of the centaur’s arrow, the tip of
the goblin’s hat, and each of the house-elf ’s ears, so that the tinkling
hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of Apparators
and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards, most
of whom were wearing glum, early-morning looks, strode toward a set
of golden gates at the far end of the hall.
“This way,” said Mr. Weasley.
They joined the throng, wending their way between the Ministry
workers, some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment,
others battered briefcases, still others reading the Daily Prophet as they
walked. As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and
bronze Knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool. A
small, smudged sign beside it read:
All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will be given to
St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries

127
CHAPTER SEVEN
If I’m not expelled from Hogwarts, I’ll put in ten Galleons, Harry
found himself thinking desperately.
“Over here, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they stepped out of the
stream of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates, toward a
desk on the left, over which hung a sign saying security. A badly
shaven wizard in peacock-blue robes looked up as they approached
and put down his Daily Prophet.
“I’m escorting a visitor,” said Mr. Weasley, gesturing toward Harry.
“Step over here,” said the wizard in a bored voice.
Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden
rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry’s
front and back.
“Wand,” grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the
golden instrument and holding out his hand.
Harry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it onto a strange
brass instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with
only one dish. It began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came
speeding out of a slit in the base. The wizard tore this off and read the
writing upon it.
“Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That
correct?”
“Yes,” said Harry nervously.
“I keep this,” said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a
small brass spike. “You get this back,” he added, thrusting the wand at
Harry.
“Thank you.”
“Hang on. . . .” said the wizard slowly.
His eyes had darted from the silver visitor’s badge on Harry’s chest
to his forehead.
“Thank you, Eric,” said Mr. Weasley firmly, and grasping Harry by
the shoulder, he steered him away from the desk and back into the
stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates.

128
THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. Weasley through
the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood
behind wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr. Weasley joined the
crowd around one of them. A big, bearded wizard holding a large
cardboard box stood nearby. The box was emitting rasping noises.
“All right, Arthur?” said the wizard, nodding at Mr. Weasley.
“What’ve you got there, Bob?” asked Mr. Weasley, looking at the
box.
“We’re not sure,” said the wizard seriously. “We thought it was a
bog-standard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a seri-
ous breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.”
With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of
them; the golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr. Weasley moved in-
side it with the rest of the crowd. Harry found himself jammed against
the back wall of the lift. Several witches and wizards were looking at
him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyone’s eye, flat-
tening his fringe as he did so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the
lift ascended slowly, chains rattling all the while, while the same cool
female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again.
“Level seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorpo-
rating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official
Gobstones Club, and Ludicrous Patents Office.”
The lift doors opened; Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking corridor,
with various posters of Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the
walls; one of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of
broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down
the corridor. The doors closed, the lift juddered upward again, and the
woman’s voice said, “Level six, Department of Magical Transport, in-
corporating the Floo Network Authority, Broom Regulatory Control,
Portkey Office, and Apparation Test Center.”
Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and
wizards got out; at the same time, several paper airplanes swooped

129
CHAPTER SEVEN
into the lift. Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around
above his head; they were a pale violet color and he could see ministry
of magic stamped along the edges of their wings.
“Just Interdepartmental memos,” Mr. Weasley muttered to him.
“We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable . . . droppings all
over the desks . . .”
As they clattered upward again, the memos flapped around the
swaying lamp in the lift’s ceiling.
“Level five, Department of International Magical Cooperation, in-
corporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the
International Magical Office of Law, and the International Confeder-
ation of Wizards, British Seats.”
When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few
more witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that
the light from the lamp in the ceiling flickered and flashed as they
darted around it.
“Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of
Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions,
Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau.”
“ ’S’cuse,” said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and
he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged
shut yet again.
“Level three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes,
including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Head-
quarters, and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.”
Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr. Weasley, Harry, and
a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that
was trailing on the ground. The remaining memos continued to soar
around the lamp as the lift juddered upward again, and then the doors
opened and the voice said, “Level two, Department of Magical Law
Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror
Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services.”


THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
“This is us, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they followed the witch
out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors. “My office is on the
other side of the floor.”
“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, as they passed a window through which
sunlight was streaming, “aren’t we underground?”
“Yes, we are,” said Mr. Weasley, “those are enchanted windows;
Magical Maintenance decide what weather we’re getting every day.
We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a
pay raise. . . . Just round here, Harry.”
They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors,
and emerged in a cluttered, open area divided into cubicles, which
were buzzing with talk and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out
of cubicles like miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the nearest cu-
bicle read auror headquarters.
Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed.
The Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pic-
tures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters
of their favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet.
A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer than Bill’s was sitting with
his boots up on his desk, dictating a report to his quill. A little farther
along, a witch with a patch over her eye was talking over the top of her
cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt.
“Morning, Weasley,” said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer.
“I’ve been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?”
“Yes, if it really is a second,” said Mr. Weasley, “I’m in rather a
hurry.”
They were talking to each other as though they hardly knew each
other, and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr.
Weasley stood on his foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and
into the very last cubicle.
Harry received a slight shock; Sirius’s face was blinking down at
him from every direction. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs

131
CHAPTER SEVEN
— even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters’ wedding —
papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world
in which little red pins were glowing like jewels.
“Here,” said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, shoving a sheaf of
parchment into his hand, “I need as much information as possible on
flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We’ve re-
ceived information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.”
Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper,
“Give him the magazine, he might find it interesting.” Then he said in
normal tones, “And don’t take too long, Weasley, the delay on that
firelegs report held our investigation up for a month.”
“If you had read my report you would know that the term is
‘firearms,’ ” said Mr. Weasley coolly. “And I’m afraid you’ll have to wait
for information on motorcycles, we’re extremely busy at the mo-
ment.” He dropped his voice and said, “If you can get away before
seven, Molly’s making meatballs.”
He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley’s cubicle,
through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left,
marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and dis-
tinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door
on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the
right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading misuse of muggle
artifacts.
Mr. Weasley’s dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the
broom cupboard. Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was
barely room to move around them because of all the overflowing filing
cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files.
The little wall space available bore witness to Mr. Weasley’s obsessions;
there were several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine,
two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle
children’s books, and a diagram showing how to wire a plug.
Sitting on top of Mr. Weasley’s overflowing in-tray was an old


THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
toaster that was hiccuping in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty
leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs. A photograph of the
Weasley family stood beside the in-tray. Harry noticed that Percy ap-
peared to have walked out of it.
“We haven’t got a window,” said Mr. Weasley apologetically, taking
off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair. “We’ve
asked, but they don’t seem to think we need one. Have a seat, Harry,
doesn’t look as if Perkins is in yet.”
Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkins’s desk while
Mr. Weasley rifled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shackle-
bolt had given him.
“Ah,” he said, grinning, as he extracted a copy of a magazine enti-
tled The Quibbler from its midst, “yes . . .” He flicked through it.
“Yes, he’s right, I’m sure Sirius will find that very amusing — oh dear,
what’s this now?”
A memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered
to rest on top of the hiccuping toaster. Mr. Weasley unfolded it and
read aloud, “ ‘Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal
Green, kindly investigate immediately.’ This is getting ridiculous. . . .”
“A regurgitating toilet?”
“Anti-Muggle pranksters,” said Mr. Weasley, frowning. “We had
two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Mug-
gles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing —
well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those — those
pumbles, I think they’re called — you know, the ones who mend pipes
and things —”
“Plumbers?”
“— exactly, yes, but of course they’re flummoxed. I only hope we
can catch whoever’s doing it.”
“Will it be Aurors who catch them?”
“Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it’ll be the ordinary Magical
Law Enforcement Patrol — ah, Harry, this is Perkins.”

133
CHAPTER SEVEN
A stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just
entered the room, panting.
“Oh Arthur!” he said desperately, without looking at Harry.
“Thank goodness, I didn’t know what to do for the best, whether to
wait here for you or not, I’ve just sent an owl to your home but you’ve
obviously missed it — an urgent message came ten minutes ago —”
“I know about the regurgitating toilet,” said Mr. Weasley.
“No, no, it’s not the toilet, it’s the Potter boy’s hearing — they’ve
changed the time and venue — it starts at eight o’clock now and it’s
down in old Courtroom Ten —”
“Down in old — but they told me — Merlin’s beard —”
Mr. Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp, and leapt from his
chair.
“Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!”
Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr. Weasley
left the office at a run, Harry on his heels.
“Why have they changed the time?” Harry said breathlessly as they
hurtled past the Auror cubicles; people poked out their heads and
stared as they streaked past. Harry felt as though he had left all his in-
sides back at Perkins’s desk.
“I’ve no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if you’d
missed it it would have been catastrophic!”
Mr. Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impa-
tiently at the down button.
“Come ON!”
The lift clattered into view and they hurried inside. Every time it
stopped Mr. Weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number
nine button.
“Those courtrooms haven’t been used in years,” said Mr. Weasley
angrily. “I can’t think why they’re doing it down there — unless —
but no . . .”

THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
A plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that
moment, and Mr. Weasley did not elaborate.
“The Atrium,” said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid
open, showing Harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the
fountain. The plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with
a very mournful face got in.
“Morning, Arthur,” he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to
descend. “Don’t often see you down here. . . .”
“Urgent business, Bode,” said Mr. Weasley, who was bouncing on
the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at Harry.
“Ah, yes,” said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. “Of course.”
Harry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his unfaltering
gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable.
“Department of Mysteries,” said the cool female voice, and left it at
that.
“Quick, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and
they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above. The
walls were bare; there were no windows and no doors apart from a
plain black one set at the very end of the corridor. Harry expected
them to go through it, but instead Mr. Weasley seized him by the arm
and dragged him to the left, where there was an opening leading to a
flight of steps.
“Down here, down here,” panted Mr. Weasley, taking two steps at
a time. “The lift doesn’t even come down this far . . . why they’re do-
ing it there . . .”
They reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another
corridor, which bore a great resemblance to that which led to Snape’s
dungeon at Hogwarts, with rough stone walls and torches in brackets.
The doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts
and keyholes.
“Courtroom . . . ten . . . I think . . . we’re nearly . . . yes.”

CHAPTER SEVEN
Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an
immense iron lock and slumped against the wall, clutching at a stitch
in his chest.
“Go on,” he panted, pointing his thumb at the door. “Get in
there.”
“Aren’t — aren’t you coming with — ?”
“No, no, I’m not allowed. Good luck!”
Harry’s heart was beating a violent tattoo against his Adam’s apple.
He swallowed hard, turned the heavy iron door handle, and stepped
inside the courtroom.

THE HEARING
H
arry gasped; he could not help himself. The large dungeon he
had entered was horribly familiar. He had not only seen it
before, he had been here before: This was the place he had visited in-
side Dumbledore’s Pensieve, the place where he had watched the
Lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban.
The walls were made of dark stone, dimly lit by torches. Empty
benches rose on either side of him, but ahead, in the highest benches
of all, were many shadowy figures. They had been talking in low
voices, but as the heavy door swung closed behind Harry an ominous
silence fell.
A cold male voice rang across the courtroom.
“You’re late.”
“Sorry,” said Harry nervously. “I-I didn’t know the time had
changed.”
“That is not the Wizengamot’s fault,” said the voice. “An owl was
sent to you this morning. Take your seat.”
Harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the center of the room, the
arms of which were covered in chains. He had seen those chains spring

137
CHAPTER EIGHT
to life and bind whoever sat between them. His footsteps echoed
loudly as he walked across the stone floor. When he sat gingerly on the
edge of the chair the chains clinked rather threateningly but did not
bind him. Feeling rather sick he looked up at the people seated at the
bench above.
There were about fifty of them, all, as far as he could see, wearing
plum-colored robes with an elaborately worked silver W on the left-
hand side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him, some
with very austere expressions, others looks of frank curiosity.
In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge, the Min-
ister of Magic. Fudge was a portly man who often sported a lime-green
bowler hat, though today he had dispensed with it; he had dispensed
too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to
Harry. A broad, square-jawed witch with very short gray hair sat on
Fudge’s left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding. On Fudge’s
right was another witch, but she was sitting so far back on the bench
that her face was in shadow.
“Very well,” said Fudge. “The accused being present — finally —
let us begin. Are you ready?” he called down the row.
“Yes, sir,” said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron’s brother Percy was
sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, ex-
pecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came. Percy’s
eyes, behind his horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a
quill poised in his hand.
“Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,” said Fudge in a
ringing voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, “into offenses
committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Un-
derage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry
James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging,
Surrey.
“Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic;

Minister. Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley —”
“— Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumble-
dore,” said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so
fast he cricked his neck.
Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long
midnight-blue robes and a perfectly calm expression. His long silver
beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry
and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested
halfway down his very crooked nose.
The members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All eyes were
now on Dumbledore. Some looked annoyed, others slightly fright-
ened; two elderly witches in the back row, however, raised their hands
and waved in welcome.
A powerful emotion had risen in Harry’s chest at the sight of Dum-
bledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix
song gave him. He wanted to catch Dumbledore’s eye, but Dumble-
dore was not looking his way; he was continuing to look up at the
obviously flustered Fudge.
“Ah,” said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted. “Dumble-
dore. Yes. You — er — got our — er — message that the time and —
er — place of the hearing had been changed, then?”
“I must have missed it,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. “However,
due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so
no harm done.”
“Yes — well — I suppose we’ll need another chair — I —
Weasley, could you — ?”
“Not to worry, not to worry,” said Dumbledore pleasantly; he took
out his wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair ap-
peared out of nowhere next to Harry. Dumbledore sat down, put the
tips of his long fingers together, and looked at Fudge over them with
an expression of polite interest. The Wizengamot was still muttering

139
CHAPTER EIGHT
and fidgeting restlessly; only when Fudge spoke again did they settle
down.
“Yes,” said Fudge again, shuffling his notes. “Well, then. So. The
charges. Yes.”
He extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him, took
a deep breath, and read, “The charges against the accused are as fol-
lows: That he did knowingly, deliberately, and in full awareness of the
illegality of his actions, having received a previous written warning
from the Ministry of Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus
Charm in a Muggle-inhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on
August the second at twenty-three minutes past nine, which consti-
tutes an offense under paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under section thir-
teen of the International Confederation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy.
“You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Little
Whinging, Surrey?” Fudge said, glaring at Harry over the top of his
parchment.
“Yes,” Harry said.
“You received an official warning from the Ministry for using ille-
gal magic three years ago, did you not?”
“Yes, but —”
“And yet you conjured a Patronus on the night of the second of
August?” said Fudge.
“Yes,” said Harry, “but —”
“Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school
while you are under the age of seventeen?”
“Yes, but —”
“Knowing that you were in an area full of Muggles?”
“Yes, but —”
“Fully aware that you were in close proximity to a Muggle at the
time?
“Yes,” said Harry angrily, “but I only used it because we were —”

140
THE HEARING
The witch with the monocle on Fudge’s left cut across him in a
booming voice.
“You produced a fully fledged Patronus?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “because —”
“A corporeal Patronus?”
“A — what?” said Harry.
“Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to say, it was
more than vapor or smoke?”
“Yes,” said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate,
“it’s a stag, it’s always a stag.”
“Always?” boomed Madam Bones. “You have produced a Patronus
before now?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “I’ve been doing it for over a year —”
“And you are fifteen years old?”
“Yes, and —”
“You learned this at school?”
“Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the —”
“Impressive,” said Madam Bones, staring down at him, “a true
Patronus at that age . . . very impressive indeed.”
Some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again;
a few nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads.
“It’s not a question of how impressive the magic was,” said Fudge
in a testy voice. “In fact, the more impressive the worse it is, I would
have thought, given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle!”
Those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement, but
it was the sight of Percy’s sanctimonious little nod that goaded Harry
into speech.
“I did it because of the dementors!” he said loudly, before anyone
could interrupt him again.
He had expected more muttering, but the silence that fell seemed
to be somehow denser than before.
“Dementors?” said Madam Bones after a moment, raising her thick

141
CHAPTER EIGHT
eyebrows so that her monocle looked in danger of falling out. “What
do you mean, boy?”
“I mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they
went for me and my cousin!”
“Ah,” said Fudge again, smirking unpleasantly as he looked around
at the Wizengamot, as though inviting them to share the joke. “Yes.
Yes, I thought we’d be hearing something like this.”
“Dementors in Little Whinging?” Madam Bones said in tones of
great surprise. “I don’t understand —”
“Don’t you, Amelia?” said Fudge, still smirking. “Let me explain.
He’s been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a
very nice little cover story, very nice indeed. Muggles can’t see demen-
tors, can they, boy? Highly convenient, highly convenient . . . so it’s
just your word and no witnesses. . . .”
“I’m not lying!” said Harry loudly, over another outbreak of mut-
tering from the court. “There were two of them, coming from oppo-
site ends of the alley, everything went dark and cold and my cousin
felt them and ran for it —”
“Enough, enough!” said Fudge with a very supercilious look on his
face. “I’m sorry to interrupt what I’m sure would have been a very
well-rehearsed story —”
Dumbledore cleared his throat. The Wizengamot fell silent again.
“We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of dementors in that
alleyway,” he said, “other than Dudley Dursley, I mean.”
Fudge’s plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let
air out of it. He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two,
then, with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together,
said, “We haven’t got time to listen to more taradiddles, I’m afraid,
Dumbledore. I want this dealt with quickly —”
“I may be wrong,” said Dumbledore pleasantly, “but I am sure that
under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to

142
THE HEARING
present witnesses for his or her case? Isn’t that the policy of the De-
partment of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones?” he contin-
ued, addressing the witch in the monocle.
“True,” said Madam Bones. “Perfectly true.”
“Oh, very well, very well,” snapped Fudge. “Where is this person?”
“I brought her with me,” said Dumbledore. “She’s just outside the
door. Should I — ?”
“No — Weasley, you go,” Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at
once, hurried down the stone steps from the judge’s balcony, and has-
tened past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them.
A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs. Figg. She looked
scared and more batty than ever. Harry wished she had thought to
change out of her carpet slippers.
Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs. Figg his chair, conjuring a
second one for himself.
“Full name?” said Fudge loudly, when Mrs. Figg had perched her-
self nervously on the very edge of her seat.
“Arabella Doreen Figg,” said Mrs. Figg in her quavery voice.
“And who exactly are you?” said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice.
“I’m a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter
lives,” said Mrs. Figg.
“We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whing-
ing other than Harry Potter,” said Madam Bones at once. “That situ-
ation has always been closely monitored, given . . . given past events.”
“I’m a Squib,” said Mrs. Figg. “So you wouldn’t have me registered,
would you?”
“A Squib, eh?” said Fudge, eyeing her suspiciously. “We’ll be check-
ing that. You’ll leave details of your parentage with my assistant,
Weasley. Incidentally, can Squibs see dementors?” he added, looking
left and right along the bench where he sat.
“Yes, we can!” said Mrs. Figg indignantly.

143
CHAPTER EIGHT
Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. “Very well,”
he said coolly. “What is your story?”
“I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of
Wisteria Walk, shortly after nine on the evening of the second of
August,” gabbled Mrs. Figg at once, as though she had learned what
she was saying by heart, “when I heard a disturbance down the alley-
way between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching
the mouth of the alleyway I saw dementors running —”
“Running?” said Madam Bones sharply. “Dementors don’t run,
they glide.”
“That’s what I meant to say,” said Mrs. Figg quickly, patches of
pink appearing in her withered cheeks. “Gliding along the alley to-
ward what looked like two boys.”
“What did they look like?” said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes
so that the monocle’s edges disappeared into her flesh.
“Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny —”
“No, no,” said Madam Bones impatiently, “the dementors . . . de-
scribe them.”
“Oh,” said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now.
“They were big. Big and wearing cloaks.”
Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever
Mrs. Figg said to the contrary, it sounded to him as though the most
she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor, and a picture could
never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way
they moved, hovering inches over the ground, or the rotting smell of
them, or that terrible, rattling noise they made as they sucked on the
surrounding air . . . A dumpy wizard with a large black mustache in
the second row leaned close to his neighbor, a frizzy-haired witch, and
whispered something in her ear. She smirked and nodded.
“Big and wearing cloaks,” repeated Madam Bones coolly, while
Fudge snorted derisively. “I see. Anything else?”

144
THE HEARING
“Yes,” said Mrs. Figg. “I felt them. Everything went cold, and this
was a very warm summer’s night, mark you. And I felt . . . as though
all happiness had gone from the world . . . and I remembered . . .
dreadful things. . . .”
Her voice shook and died.
Madam Bones’ eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks
under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it.
“What did the dementors do?” she asked, and Harry felt a rush of
hope.
“They went for the boys,” said Mrs. Figg, her voice stronger and
more confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. “One
of them had fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the
dementor. That was Harry. He tried twice and produced silver vapor.
On the third attempt, he produced a Patronus, which charged down
the first dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased away the
second from his cousin. And that . . . that was what happened,” Mrs.
Figg finished, somewhat lamely.
Madam Bones looked down at Mrs. Figg in silence; Fudge was not
looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally he raised his
eyes and said, rather aggressively “That’s what you saw, is it?”
“That was what happened,” Mrs. Figg repeated.
“Very well,” said Fudge. “You may go.”
Mrs. Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then
got up and shuffled off toward the door again. Harry heard it thud
shut behind her.
“Not a very convincing witness,” said Fudge loftily.
“Oh, I don’t know,” said Madam Bones in her booming voice. “She
certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately.
And I can’t imagine why she would say they were there if they
weren’t —”
“But dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening

145
CHAPTER EIGHT
to come across a wizard?” snorted Fudge. “The odds on that must be
very, very long, even Bagman wouldn’t have bet —”
“Oh, I don’t think any of us believe the dementors were there by
coincidence,” said Dumbledore lightly.
The witch sitting to the right of Fudge with her face in shadow
moved slightly, but everyone else was quite still and silent.
“And what is that supposed to mean?” asked Fudge icily.
“It means that I think they were ordered there,” said Dumbledore.
“I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair
of dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging!” barked Fudge.
“Not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than
the Ministry of Magic these days,” said Dumbledore calmly. “I have
already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius.”
“Yes, you have,” said Fudge forcefully, “and I have no reason to be-
lieve that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The
dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we
ask them to.”
“Then,” said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, “we must ask our-
selves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors
into that alleyway on the second of August.”
In the complete silence that greeted these words, the witch to the
right of Fudge leaned forward so that Harry saw her for the first time.
He thought she looked just like a large, pale toad. She was rather
squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon, and a
very wide, slack mouth. Her eyes were large, round, and slightly
bulging. Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short
curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a
long sticky tongue.
“The Chair recognizes Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecre-
tary to the Minister,” said Fudge.
The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took
Harry aback; he had been expecting a croak.

146
THE HEARING
“I’m sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,”
she said with a simper that left her big, round eyes as cold as ever. “So
silly of me. But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were sug-
gesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy!”
She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry’s
neck stand up. A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with
her. It could not have been plainer that not one of them was really
amused.
“If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Min-
istry of Magic, and it is also true that two dementors attacked Harry
and his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at
the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,” said Dumbledore po-
litely. “Of course, these particular dementors may have been outside
Ministry control —”
“There are no dementors outside Ministry control!” snapped
Fudge, who had turned brick red.
Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow.
“Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into
why two dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they at-
tacked without authorization.”
“It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does
not do, Dumbledore!” snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of
which Uncle Vernon would have been proud.
“Of course it isn’t,” said Dumbledore mildly. “I was merely ex-
pressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated.”
He glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her monocle and
stared back at him, frowning slightly.
“I would remind everybody that the behavior of these dementors,
if indeed they are not figments of this boy’s imagination, is not the
subject of this hearing!” said Fudge. “We are here to examine Harry
Potter’s offenses under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of
Underage Sorcery!”

147
CHAPTER EIGHT
“Of course we are,” said Dumbledore, “but the presence of demen-
tors in that alleyway is highly relevant. Clause seven of the Decree
states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circum-
stances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations that
threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself, or witches, wizards, or
Muggles present at the time of the —”
“We are familiar with clause seven, thank you very much!” snarled
Fudge.
“Of course you are,” said Dumbledore courteously. “Then we are
in agreement that Harry’s use of the Patronus Charm in these circum-
stances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it
describes?”
“If there were dementors, which I doubt —”
“You have heard from an eyewitness,” Dumbledore interrupted. “If
you still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again. I am
sure she would not object.”
“I — that — not —” blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers be-
fore him. “It’s — I want this over with today, Dumbledore!”
“But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard
from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,”
said Dumbledore.
“Serious miscarriage, my hat!” said Fudge at the top of his voice.
“Have you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull sto-
ries this boy has come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up
his flagrant misuse of magic out of school? I suppose you’ve forgotten
the Hover Charm he used three years ago —”
“That wasn’t me, it was a house-elf!” said Harry.
“YOU SEE?” roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry’s di-
rection. “A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you —”
“The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts
School,” said Dumbledore. “I can summon him here in an instant to
give evidence if you wish.”

148
THE HEARING
“I — not — I haven’t got time to listen to house-elves! Anyway,
that’s not the only — he blew up his aunt, for God’s sake!” Fudge
shouted, banging his fist on the judge’s bench and upsetting a bottle
of ink.
“And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, ac-
cepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control
their emotions,” said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to
scrub the ink off his notes.
“And I haven’t even started on what he gets up to at school —”
“— but as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts
students for misdemeanors at school, Harry’s behavior there is not rel-
evant to this inquiry,” said Dumbledore, politely as ever, but now
with a suggestion of coolness behind his words.
“Oho!” said Fudge. “Not our business what he does at school, eh?
You think so?”
“The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts stu-
dents, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of
August,” said Dumbledore. “Nor does it have the right to confiscate
wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I re-
minded you on the night of the second of August. In your admirable
haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am
sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.”
“Laws can be changed,” said Fudge savagely.
“Of course they can,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head. “And
you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in
the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has
already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a
simple matter of underage magic!”
A few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their
seats. Fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce. The toadlike
witch on his right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face
quite expressionless.

149
CHAPTER EIGHT
“As far as I am aware, however,” Dumbledore continued, “there is
no law yet in place that says this court’s job is to punish Harry for
every bit of magic he has ever performed. He has been charged with a
specific offense and he has presented his defense. All he and I can do
now is to await your verdict.”
Dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more.
Fudge glared at him, evidently incensed. Harry glanced sideways at
Dumbledore, seeking reassurance; he was not at all sure that Dumble-
dore was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about
time they made a decision. Again, however, Dumbledore seemed
oblivious to Harry’s attempt to catch his eye. He continued to look up
at the benches where the entire Wizengamot had fallen into urgent,
whispered conversations.
Harry looked at his feet. His heart, which seemed to have swollen
to an unnatural size, was thumping loudly under his ribs. He had ex-
pected the hearing to last longer than this. He was not at all sure that
he had made a good impression. He had not really said very much. He
ought to have explained more fully about the dementors, about how
he had fallen over, about how both he and Dudley had nearly been
kissed. . . .
Twice he looked up at Fudge and opened his mouth to speak, but
his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times
he merely took a deep breath and looked back at his shoes.
Then the whispering stopped. Harry wanted to look up at the
judges, but found that it was really much, much easier to keep exam-
ining his laces.
“Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?” said Madam
Bones’s booming voice.
Harry’s head jerked upward. There were hands in the air, many of
them . . . more than half ! Breathing very fast, he tried to count, but
before he could finish Madam Bones had said, “And those in favor of
conviction?”

Fudge raised his hand; so did half a dozen others, including the
witch on his right and the heavily mustached wizard and the frizzy-
haired witch in the second row.
Fudge glanced around at them all, looking as though there was
something large stuck in his throat, then lowered his own hand. He
took two deep breaths and then said, in a voice distorted by sup-
pressed rage, “Very well, very well . . . cleared of all charges.”
“Excellent,” said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feet, pulling
out his wand, and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish. “Well, I
must be getting along. Good day to you all.”
And without looking once at Harry, he swept from the dungeon.

D
umbledore’s abrupt departure took Harry completely by sur-
prise. He remained sitting where he was in the chained chair,
struggling with his feelings of shock and relief. The Wizengamot were
all getting to their feet, talking, and gathering up their papers and
packing them away. Harry stood up. Nobody seemed to be paying
him the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on Fudge’s
right, who was now gazing down at him instead of at Dumbledore. Ig-
noring her, he tried to catch Fudge’s eye, or Madam Bones’s, wanting
to ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined
not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase,
so he took a few tentative steps toward the exit and when nobody
called him back, broke into a very fast walk.
He took the last few steps at a run, wrenched open the door, and al-
most collided with Mr. Weasley, who was standing right outside,
looking pale and apprehensive.
“Dumbledore didn’t say —”
“Cleared,” Harry said, pulling the door closed behind him, “of all

“Harry, that’s wonderful! Well, of course, they couldn’t have found
you guilty, not on the evidence, but even so, I can’t pretend I wasn’t —”
But Mr. Weasley broke off, because the courtroom door had just
opened again. The Wizengamot were filing out.
“Merlin’s beard,” said Mr. Weasley wonderingly, pulling Harry
aside to let them all pass, “you were tried by the full court?”
“I think so,” said Harry quietly.
One or two of the passing wizards nodded to Harry as they passed
and a few, including Madam Bones, said, “Morning, Arthur,” to Mr.
Weasley, but most averted their eyes. Cornelius Fudge and the toad-
like witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon. Fudge acted as
though Mr. Weasley and Harry were part of the wall, but again, the
witch looked almost appraisingly at Harry as she passed. Last of all to
pass was Percy. Like Fudge, he completely ignored his father and
Harry; he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a
handful of spare quills, his back rigid and his nose in the air. The lines
around Mr. Weasley’s mouth tightened slightly, but other than this he
gave no sign that he had noticed his third son.
“I’m going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the
good news,” he said, beckoning Harry forward as Percy’s heels disap-
peared up the stairs to the ninth level. I’ll drop you off on the way to
that toilet in Bethnal Green. Come on. . . .”
“So what will you have to do about the toilet?” Harry asked, grin-
ning. Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual. It
was starting to sink in: He was cleared, he was going back to Hogwarts.
“Oh, it’s a simple enough anti-jinx,” said Mr. Weasley as they
mounted the stairs, “but it’s not so much having to repair the damage,
it’s more the attitude behind the vandalism, Harry. Muggle-baiting
might strike some wizards as funny, but it’s an expression of some-
thing much deeper and nastier, and I for one —”
Mr. Weasley broke off in mid-sentence. They had just reached the

153
CHAPTER NINE
ninth-level corridor, and Cornelius Fudge was standing a few feet
away from them, talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair
and a pointed, pale face.
The second man turned at the sound of their footsteps. He too
broke off in mid-conversation, his cold gray eyes narrowed and fixed
upon Harry’s face.
“Well, well, well . . . Patronus Potter,” said Lucius Malfoy coolly.
Harry felt winded, as though he had just walked into something
heavy. He had last seen those cool gray eyes through slits in a Death
Eater’s hood, and last heard that man’s voice jeering in a dark grave-
yard while Lord Voldemort tortured him. He could not believe that
Lucius Malfoy dared look him in the face; he could not believe that he
was here, in the Ministry of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talk-
ing to him, when Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy
was a Death Eater.
“The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter,”
drawled Mr. Malfoy. “Quite astonishing, the way you continue to
wriggle out of very tight holes. . . . Snakelike, in fact . . .”
Mr. Weasley gripped Harry’s shoulder in warning.
“Yeah,” said Harry, “yeah, I’m good at escaping. . . .”
Lucius Malfoy raised his eyes to Mr. Weasley’s face.
“And Arthur Weasley too! What are you doing here, Arthur?”
“I work here,” said Mr. Weasley shortly.
“Not here, surely?” said Mr. Malfoy, raising his eyebrows and glanc-
ing toward the door over Mr. Weasley’s shoulder. “I thought you were
up on the second floor. . . . Don’t you do something that involves
sneaking Muggle artifacts home and bewitching them?”
“No,” said Mr. Weasley curtly, his fingers now biting into Harry’s
shoulder.
“What are you doing here anyway?” Harry asked Lucius Malfoy.
“I don’t think private matters between myself and the Minister are
any concern of yours, Potter,” said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his

154
THE WOES OF
MRS. WEASLEY
robes; Harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like
a full pocket of gold. “Really, just because you are Dumbledore’s fa-
vorite boy, you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of
us. . . . Shall we go up to your office, then, Minister?”
“Certainly,” said Fudge, turning his back on Harry and Mr.
Weasley. “This way, Lucius.”
They strode off together, talking in low voices. Mr. Weasley did not
let go of Harry’s shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift.
“Why wasn’t he waiting outside Fudge’s office if they’ve got busi-
ness to do together?” Harry burst out furiously. “What was he doing
down here?”
“Trying to sneak down to the courtroom, if you ask me,” said Mr.
Weasley, looking extremely agitated as he glanced over his shoulder as
though making sure they could not be overheard. “Trying to find out
whether you’d been expelled or not. I’ll leave a note for Dumbledore
when I drop you off, he ought to know Malfoy’s been talking to Fudge
again.”
“What private business have they got together anyway?”
“Gold, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley angrily. “Malfoy’s been giving
generously to all sorts of things for years. . . . Gets him in with the
right people . . . then he can ask favors . . . delay laws he doesn’t want
passed . . . Oh, he’s very well connected, Lucius Malfoy. . . .”
The lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of memos that
flapped around Mr. Weasley’s head as he pressed the button for the
Atrium and the doors clanged shut; he waved them away irritably.
“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry slowly, “if Fudge is meeting Death
Eaters like Malfoy, if he’s seeing them alone, how do we know they
haven’t put the Imperius Curse on him?”
“Don’t think it hadn’t occurred to us, Harry,” muttered Mr.
Weasley. “But Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord
at the moment — which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of comfort.
. . . Best not talk about it anymore just now, Harry. . . .”

155
CHAPTER NINE
The doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almost-
deserted Atrium. Eric the security man was hidden behind his Daily
Prophet again. They had walked straight past the golden fountain be-
fore Harry remembered.
“Wait. . . .” he told Mr. Weasley, and pulling his money bag from
his pocket, he turned back to the fountain.
He looked up into the handsome wizard’s face, but up close, Harry
thought he looked rather weak and foolish. The witch was wearing a
vapid smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of
goblins and centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring this
soppily at humans of any description. Only the house-elf ’s attitude of
creeping servility looked convincing. With a grin at the thought of
what Hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf, Harry
turned his money bag upside down and emptied not just ten
Galleons, but the whole contents into the pool at the statues’ feet.
“I knew it!” yelled Ron, punching the air. “You always get away with
stuff !”
“They were bound to clear you,” said Hermione, who had looked
positively faint with anxiety when Harry had entered the kitchen and
was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes. “There was no case
against you, none at all. . . .”
“Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering they all knew
I’d get off,” said Harry, smiling.
Mrs. Weasley was wiping her face on her apron, and Fred, George,
and Ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went “He
got off, he got off, he got off —”
“That’s enough, settle down!” shouted Mr. Weasley, though he too
was smiling. “Listen, Sirius, Lucius Malfoy was at the Ministry —”
“What?” said Sirius sharply.
“He got off, he got off, he got off —”
“Be quiet, you three! Yes, we saw him talking to Fudge on level

156

MRS. WEASLEY
nine, then they went up to Fudge’s office together. Dumbledore ought
to know.”
“Absolutely,” said Sirius. “We’ll tell him, don’t worry.”
“Well, I’d better get going, there’s a vomiting toilet in Bethnal
Green waiting for me. Molly, I’ll be late, I’m covering for Tonks, but
Kingsley might be dropping in for dinner —”
“He got off, he got off, he got off —”
“That’s enough — Fred — George — Ginny!” said Mrs. Weasley,
as Mr. Weasley left the kitchen. “Harry dear, come and sit down, have
some lunch, you hardly ate breakfast. . . .”
Ron and Hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking
happier than they had done since he had first arrived at number
twelve, Grimmauld Place, and Harry’s feeling of giddy relief, which
had been somewhat dented by his encounter with Lucius Malfoy,
swelled again. The gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcom-
ing all of a sudden; even Kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his
snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the
noise.
“ ’Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no
way they were going to convict you,” said Ron happily, now dishing
great mounds of mashed potatoes onto everyone’s plates.
“Yeah, he swung it for me,” said Harry. He felt that it would sound
highly ungrateful, not to mention childish, to say, “I wish he’d talked
to me, though. Or even looked at me.”
And as he thought this, the scar on his forehead burned so badly
that he clapped his hand to it.
“What’s up?” said Hermione, looking alarmed.
“Scar,” Harry mumbled. “But it’s nothing. . . . It happens all the
time now. . . .”
None of the others had noticed a thing; all of them were now help-
ing themselves to food while gloating over Harry’s narrow escape;
Fred, George, and Ginny were still singing. Hermione looked rather

157
CHAPTER NINE
anxious, but before she could say anything, Ron said happily, “I bet
Dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us, you know.”
“I don’t think he’ll be able to, Ron,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting a
huge plate of roast chicken down in front of Harry. “He’s really very
busy at the moment.”
“HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF —”
“SHUT UP!” roared Mrs. Weasley.
Over the next few days Harry could not help noticing that there was
one person within number twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not
seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to Hogwarts. Sir-
ius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the
news, wringing Harry’s hand and beaming just like the rest of them;
soon, however, he was moodier and surlier than before, talking less to
everybody, even Harry, and spending increasing amounts of time shut
up in his mother’s room with Buckbeak.
“Don’t you go feeling guilty!” said Hermione sternly, after Harry
had confided some of his feelings to her and Ron while they
scrubbed out a moldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later.
“You belong at Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he’s
being selfish.”
“That’s a bit harsh, Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he at-
tempted to prize off a bit of mold that had attached itself firmly to his
finger, “you wouldn’t want to be stuck inside this house without
company.”
“He’ll have company!” said Hermione. “It’s headquarters to the
Order of the Phoenix, isn’t it? He just got his hopes up that Harry
would be coming to live here with him.”
“I don’t think that’s true,” said Harry, wringing out his cloth. “He
wouldn’t give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could.”
“He just didn’t want to get his own hopes up even more,” said
Hermione wisely. “And he probably felt a bit guilty himself, because I

158
THE WOES OF
MRS. WEASLEY
think a part of him was really hoping you’d be expelled. Then you’d
both be outcasts together.”
“Come off it!” said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely
shrugged.
“Suit yourselves. But I sometimes think Ron’s mum’s right, and Sir-
ius gets confused about whether you’re you or your father, Harry.”
“So you think he’s touched in the head?” said Harry heatedly.
“No, I just think he’s been very lonely for a long time,” said
Hermione simply.
At this point Mrs. Weasley entered the bedroom behind them.
“Still not finished?” she said, poking her head into the cupboard.
“I thought you might be here to tell us to have a break!” said Ron
bitterly. “D’you know how much mold we’ve got rid of since we ar-
rived here?”
“You were so keen to help the Order,” said Mrs. Weasley, “you can
do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in.”
“I feel like a house-elf,” grumbled Ron.
“Well, now that you understand what dreadful lives they lead, per-
haps you’ll be a bit more active in S.P.E.W.!” said Hermione hopefully,
as Mrs. Weasley left them to it again. “You know, maybe it wouldn’t
be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the
time — we could do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room,
all proceeds to S.P.E.W., it would raise awareness as well as funds —”
“I’ll sponsor you to shut up about spew,” Ron muttered irritably,
but only so Harry could hear him.
Harry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more
as the end of the holidays approached; he could not wait to see Hagrid
again, to play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to
the Herbology greenhouses. It would be a treat just to leave this dusty,
musty house, where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and
Kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed, though
Harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of Sirius.

159
CHAPTER NINE
The fact was that living at the headquarters of the anti-Voldemort
movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would
have expected before he’d experienced it. Though members of the Or-
der of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for
meals, sometimes only for a few minutes’ whispered conversation,
Mrs. Weasley made sure that Harry and the others were kept well out
of earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody, not even Sir-
ius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to know anything more than he
had heard on the night of his arrival.
On the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hed-
wig’s owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered
their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.
“Booklists have arrived,” he said, throwing one of the envelopes up
to Harry, who was standing on a chair. “About time, I thought they’d
forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this. . . .”
Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw
the bag over Ron’s head into the wastepaper basket in the corner,
which swallowed it and belched loudly. He then opened his letter: It
contained two pieces of parchment, one the usual reminder that term
started on the first of September, the other telling him which books he
would need for the coming year.
“Only two new ones,” he said, reading the list. “The Standard Book
of Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda Goshawk and Defensive Magical Theory,
by Wilbert Slinkhard.”
Crack.
Fred and George Apparated right beside Harry. He was so used to
them doing this by now that he didn’t even fall off his chair.
“We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book,” said
Fred conversationally.
“Because it means Dumbledore’s found a new Defense Against the
Dark Arts teacher,” said George.

160
THE WOES OF
MRS. WEASLEY
“And about time too,” said Fred.
“What d’you mean?” Harry asked, jumping down beside them.
“Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears
a few weeks back,” Fred told Harry, “and from what they were saying,
Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this
year.”
“Not surprising, is it, when you look at what’s happened to the last
four?” said George.
“One sacked, one dead, one’s memory removed, and one locked in
a trunk for nine months,” said Harry, counting them off on his fin-
gers. “Yeah, I see what you mean.”
“What’s up with you, Ron?” asked Fred.
Ron did not answer. Harry looked around. Ron was standing very
still with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts.
“What’s the matter?” said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to
look over his shoulder at the parchment.
Fred’s mouth fell open too.
“Prefect?” he said, staring incredulously at the letter. “Prefect?”
George leapt forward, seized the envelope in Ron’s other hand, and
turned it upside down. Harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into
George’s palm.
“No way,” said George in a hushed voice.
“There’s been a mistake,” said Fred, snatching the letter out of
Ron’s grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a wa-
termark. “No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect. . . .”
The twins’ heads turned in unison and both of them stared at
Harry.
“We thought you were a cert!” said Fred in a tone that suggested
Harry had tricked them in some way.
“We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you!” said George
indignantly.

161
CHAPTER NINE
“Winning the Triwizard and everything!” said Fred.
“I suppose all the mad stuff must’ve counted against him,” said
George to Fred.
“Yeah,” said Fred slowly. “Yeah, you’ve caused too much trouble,
mate. Well, at least one of you’s got their priorities right.”
He strode over to Harry and clapped him on the back while giving
Ron a scathing look.
“Prefect . . . ickle Ronnie the prefect . . .”
“Oh, Mum’s going to be revolting,” groaned George, thrusting the
prefect badge back at Ron as though it might contaminate him.
Ron, who still had not said a word, took the badge, stared at it for
a moment, and then held it out to Harry as though asking mutely for
confirmation that it was genuine. Harry took it. A large P was super-
imposed on the Gryffindor lion. He had seen a badge just like this on
Percy’s chest on his very first day at Hogwarts.
The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her
cheeks flushed and her hair flying. There was an envelope in her hand.
“Did you — did you get — ?”
She spotted the badge in Harry’s hand and let out a shriek.
“I knew it!” she said excitedly, brandishing her letter. “Me too,
Harry, me too!”
“No,” said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron’s hand.
“It’s Ron, not me.”
“It — what?”
“Ron’s prefect, not me,” Harry said.
“Ron?” said Hermione, her jaw dropping. “But . . . are you sure? I
mean —”
She turned red as Ron looked around at her with a defiant expres-
sion on his face.
“It’s my name on the letter,” he said.
“I . . .” said Hermione, looking thoroughly bewildered. “I . . . well
. . . wow! Well done, Ron! That’s really —”

162
THE WOES OF
MRS. WEASLEY
“Unexpected,” said George, nodding.
“No,” said Hermione, blushing harder than ever, “no, it’s not . . .
Ron’s done loads of . . . he’s really . . .”
The door behind her opened a little wider and Mrs. Weasley
backed into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes.
“Ginny said the booklists had come at last,” she said, glancing
around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and
started sorting the robes into two piles. “If you give them to me I’ll
take them over to Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books
while you’re packing. Ron, I’ll have to get you more pajamas, these are
at least six inches too short, I can’t believe how fast you’re growing . . .
what color would you like?”
“Get him red and gold to match his badge,” said George, smirking.
“Match his what?” said Mrs. Weasley absently, rolling up a pair of
maroon socks and placing them on Ron’s pile.
“His badge,” said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over
quickly. “His lovely shiny new prefect’s badge.”
Fred’s words took a moment to penetrate Mrs. Weasley’s preoccu-
pation about pajamas.
“His . . . but . . . Ron, you’re not. . . ?”
Ron held up his badge.
Mrs. Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermione’s.
“I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A
prefect! That’s everyone in the family!”
“What are Fred and I, next-door neighbors?” said George indig-
nantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her
youngest son.
“Wait until your father hears! Ron, I’m so proud of you, what won-
derful news, you could end up Head Boy just like Bill and Percy, it’s
the first step! Oh, what a thing to happen in the middle of all this
worry, I’m just thrilled, oh Ronnie —”
Fred and George were both making loud retching noises behind

her back but Mrs. Weasley did not notice; arms tight around Ron’s
neck, she was kissing him all over his face, which had turned a brighter
scarlet than his badge.
“Mum . . . don’t . . . Mum, get a grip. . . .” he muttered, trying to
push her away.
She let go of him and said breathlessly, “Well, what will it be? We
gave Percy an owl, but you’ve already got one, of course.”
“W-what do you mean?” said Ron, looking as though he did not
dare believe his ears.
“You’ve got to have a reward for this!” said Mrs. Weasley fondly.
“How about a nice new set of dress robes?”
“We’ve already bought him some,” said Fred sourly, who looked as
though he sincerely regretted this generosity.
“Or a new cauldron, Charlie’s old one’s rusting through, or a new
rat, you always liked Scabbers —”
“Mum,” said Ron hopefully, “can I have a new broom?”
Mrs. Weasley’s face fell slightly; broomsticks were expensive.
“Not a really good one!” Ron hastened to add. “Just — just a new
one for a change . . .”
Mrs. Weasley hesitated, then smiled.
“Of course you can. . . . Well, I’d better get going if I’ve got a broom
to buy too. I’ll see you all later. . . . Little Ronnie, a prefect! And don’t
forget to pack your trunks. . . . A prefect . . . Oh, I’m all of a dither!”
She gave Ron yet another kiss on the cheek, sniffed loudly, and bus-
tled from the room.
Fred and George exchanged looks.
“You don’t mind if we don’t kiss you, do you, Ron?” said Fred in a
falsely anxious voice.
“We could curtsy, if you like,” said George.
“Oh, shut up,” said Ron, scowling at them.
“Or what?” said Fred, an evil grin spreading across his face. “Going
to put us in detention?”

164

MRS. WEASLEY
“I’d love to see him try,” sniggered George.
“He could if you don’t watch out!” said Hermione angrily, at which
Fred and George burst out laughing and Ron muttered, “Drop it,
Hermione.”
“We’re going to have to watch our step, George,” said Fred, pre-
tending to tremble, “with these two on our case. . . .”
“Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally over,” said
George, shaking his head.
And with another loud crack, the twins Disapparated.
“Those two!” said Hermione furiously, staring up at the ceiling,
through which they could now hear Fred and George roaring with
laughter in the room upstairs. “Don’t pay any attention to them, Ron,
they’re only jealous!”
“I don’t think they are,” said Ron doubtfully, also looking up at the
ceiling. “They’ve always said only prats become prefects. . . . Still,” he
added on a happier note, “they’ve never had new brooms! I wish I
could go with Mum and choose. . . . She’ll never be able to afford a
Nimbus, but there’s the new Cleansweep out, that’d be great. . . .
Yeah, I think I’ll go and tell her I like the Cleansweep, just so she
knows. . . .”
He dashed from the room, leaving Harry and Hermione alone.
For some reason, Harry found that he did not want to look at
Hermione. He turned to his bed, picked up the pile of clean robes
Mrs. Weasley had laid upon it, and crossed the room to his trunk.
“Harry?” said Hermione tentatively.
“Well done,” said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice
at all, and still not looking at her. “Brilliant. Prefect. Great.”
“Thanks,” said Hermione. “Erm — Harry — could I borrow
Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad? They’ll be really pleased — I
mean, prefect is something they can understand —”
“Yeah, no problem,” said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice
that did not belong to him. “Take her!”

165
CHAPTER NINE
He leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of it, and pre-
tended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the
wardrobe and called Hedwig down. A few moments passed; Harry
heard the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only
sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again
and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings.
He straightened up and looked behind him. Hermione and Hed-
wig had gone. Harry returned slowly to his bed and sank onto it, gaz-
ing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe.
He had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the
fifth year. He had been too anxious about the possibility of being ex-
pelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging
their way toward certain people. But if he had remembered . . . if he
had thought about it . . . what would he have expected?
Not this, said a small and truthful voice inside his head.
Harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands. He could not
lie to himself; if he had known the prefect badge was on its way, he
would have expected it to come to him, not Ron. Did this make him
as arrogant as Draco Malfoy? Did he think himself superior to every-
one else? Did he really believe he was better than Ron?
No, said the small voice defiantly.
Was that true? Harry wondered, anxiously probing his own feelings.
I’m better at Quidditch, said the voice. But I’m not better at anything
else.
That was definitely true, Harry thought; he was no better than Ron
in lessons. But what about outside lessons? What about those adven-
tures he, Ron, and Hermione had had together since they had started
at Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion?
Well, Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time, said the voice
in Harry’s head.
Not all the time, though, Harry argued with himself. They didn’t fight

166
THE WOES OF
MRS. WEASLEY
Quirrell with me. They didn’t take on Riddle and the basilisk. They didn’t
get rid of all those dementors the night Sirius escaped. They weren’t in that
graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned. . . .
And the same feeling of ill usage that had overwhelmed him on
the night he had arrived rose again. I’ve definitely done more, Harry
thought indignantly. I’ve done more than either of them!
But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe Dumbledore doesn’t
choose prefects because they’ve got themselves into a load of dangerous situ-
ations. . . . Maybe he chooses them for other reasons. . . . Ron must have
something you don’t. . . .
Harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the ward-
robe’s clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said.
“No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect. . . .”
Harry gave a small snort of laughter. A second later he felt sickened
with himself.
Ron had not asked Dumbledore to give him the prefect badge. This
was not Ron’s fault. Was he, Harry, Ron’s best friend in the world,
going to sulk because he didn’t have a badge, laugh with the twins
behind Ron’s back, ruin this for Ron when, for the first time, he had
beaten Harry at something?
At this point Harry heard Ron’s footsteps on the stairs again. He
stood up, straightened his glasses, and hitched a grin onto his face as
Ron bounded back through the door.
“Just caught her!” he said happily. “She says she’ll get the Clean-
sweep if she can.”
“Cool,” Harry said, and he was relieved to hear that his voice had
stopped sounding hearty. “Listen — Ron — well done, mate.”
The smile faded off Ron’s face.
“I never thought it would be me!” he said, shaking his head, “I
thought it would be you!”
“Nah, I’ve caused too much trouble,” Harry said, echoing Fred.

167
CHAPTER NINE
“Yeah,” said Ron, “yeah, I suppose. . . . Well, we’d better get our
trunks packed, hadn’t we?”
It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered
themselves since they had arrived. It took them most of the afternoon
to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and
stow them back inside their school trunks. Harry noticed that Ron
kept moving his prefect’s badge around, first placing it on his bedside
table, then putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and lay-
ing it on his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the
black. Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach
it to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it
tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk.
Mrs. Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o’clock, laden
with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown pa-
per that Ron took from her with a moan of longing.
“Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I
want you all downstairs,” she said, but the moment she was out of
sight Ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of
his new broom, an ecstatic expression on his face.
Down in the basement Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner
over the heavily laden dinner table, which read congratulations
ron and hermione — new prefects. She looked in a better mood
than Harry had seen her all holiday.
“I thought we’d have a little party, not a sit-down dinner,” she told
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny as they entered the
room. “Your father and Bill are on their way, Ron, I’ve sent them both
owls and they’re thrilled,” she added, beaming.
Fred rolled his eyes.
Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and Kingsley Shacklebolt were already there
and Mad-Eye Moody stumped in shortly after Harry had got himself
a butterbeer.
“Oh, Alastor, I am glad you’re here,” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, as


MRS. WEASLEY
Mad-Eye shrugged off his traveling cloak. “We’ve been wanting to ask
you for ages — could you have a look in the writing desk in the draw-
ing room and tell us what’s inside it? We haven’t wanted to open it just
in case it’s something really nasty.”
“No problem, Molly . . .”
Moody’s electric-blue eye swiveled upward and stared fixedly
through the ceiling of the kitchen.
“Drawing room . . .” he growled, as the pupil contracted. “Desk in
the corner? Yeah, I see it. . . . Yeah, it’s a boggart. . . . Want me to go
up and get rid of it, Molly?”
“No, no, I’ll do it myself later,” beamed Mrs. Weasley. “You have
your drink. We’re having a little bit of a celebration, actually. . . .” She
gestured at the scarlet banner. “Fourth prefect in the family!” she said
fondly, ruffling Ron’s hair.
“Prefect, eh?” growled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and his mag-
ical eye swiveling around to gaze into the side of his head. Harry had
the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away
toward Sirius and Lupin.
“Well, congratulations,” said Moody, still glaring at Ron with his
normal eye, “authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose
Dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he
wouldn’t have appointed you. . . .”
Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved
the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest
brother. Mrs. Weasley was in such a good mood she did not even
complain that they had brought Mundungus with them too; he was
wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places
and declined the offer to remove it and put it with Moody’s traveling
cloak.
“Well, I think a toast is in order,” said Mr. Weasley, when everyone
had a drink. He raised his goblet. “To Ron and Hermione, the new
Gryffindor prefects!”

169
CHAPTER NINE
Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then
applauded.
“I was never a prefect myself,” said Tonks brightly from behind
Harry as everybody moved toward the table to help themselves to
food. Her hair was tomato-red and waist length today; she looked like
Ginny’s older sister. “My Head of House said I lacked certain neces-
sary qualities.”
“Like what?” said Ginny, who was choosing a baked potato.
“Like the ability to behave myself,” said Tonks.
Ginny laughed; Hermione looked as though she did not know
whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large
gulp of butterbeer and choking on it.
“What about you, Sirius?” Ginny asked, thumping Hermione on
the back.
Sirius, who was right beside Harry, let out his usual barklike laugh.
“No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in
detention with James. Lupin was the good boy, he got the badge.”
“I think Dumbledore might have hoped that I would be able to ex-
ercise some control over my best friends,” said Lupin. “I need scarcely
say that I failed dismally.”
Harry’s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been a prefect ei-
ther. All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; he loaded up
his plate, feeling unusually fond of everyone in the room.
Ron was rhapsodizing about his new broom to anybody who would
listen.
“. . . naught to seventy in ten seconds, not bad, is it? When you
think the Comet Two Ninety’s only naught to sixty and that’s with a
decent tailwind according to Which Broomstick?”
Hermione was talking very earnestly to Lupin about her view of elf
rights.
“I mean, it’s the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation,

170
THE WOES OF
MRS. WEASLEY
isn’t it? It all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking
they’re superior to other creatures. . . .”
Mrs. Weasley and Bill were having their usual argument about Bill’s
hair.
“. . . getting really out of hand, and you’re so good-looking, it
would look much better shorter, wouldn’t it, Harry?”
“Oh — I dunno —” said Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked his
opinion; he slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George,
who were huddled in a corner with Mundungus.
Mundungus stopped talking when he saw Harry, but Fred winked
and beckoned Harry closer.
“It’s okay,” he told Mundungus, “we can trust Harry, he’s our fi-
nancial backer.”
“Look what Dung’s gotten us,” said George, holding out his hand
to Harry. It was full of what looked like shriveled black pods. A faint
rattling noise was coming from them, even though they were com-
pletely stationary.
“Venomous Tentacula seeds,” said George. “We need them for the
Skiving Snackboxes but they’re a Class C Non-Tradeable Substance so
we’ve been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them.”
“Ten Galleons the lot, then, Dung?” said Fred.
“Wiv all the trouble I went to to get ’em?” said Mundungus, his
saggy, bloodshot eyes stretching even wider. “I’m sorry, lads, but I’m
not taking a Knut under twenty.”
“Dung likes his little joke,” Fred said to Harry.
“Yeah, his best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of knarl
quills,” said George.
“Be careful,” Harry warned them quietly.
“What?” said Fred. “Mum’s busy cooing over Prefect Ron, we’re
okay.”
“But Moody could have his eye on you,” Harry pointed out.

171
CHAPTER NINE
Mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder.
“Good point, that,” he grunted. “All right, lads, ten it is, if you’ll
take ’em quick.”
“Cheers, Harry!” said Fred delightedly, when Mundungus had
emptied his pockets into the twins’ outstretched hands and scuttled
off toward the food. “We’d better get these upstairs. . . .”
Harry watched them go, feeling slightly uneasy. It had just oc-
curred to him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would want to know how
Fred and George were financing their joke shop business when, as was
inevitable, they finally found out about it. Giving the twins his Tri-
wizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but
what if it led to another family row and a Percy-like estrangement?
Would Mrs. Weasley still feel that Harry was as good as her son if she
found out he had made it possible for Fred and George to start a ca-
reer she thought quite unsuitable?
Standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty
weight in the pit of his stomach for company, Harry caught the sound
of his own name. Kingsley Shacklebolt’s deep voice was audible even
over the surrounding chatter.
“. . . why Dumbledore didn’t make Potter a prefect?” said Kingsley.
“He’ll have had his reasons,” replied Lupin.
“But it would’ve shown confidence in him. It’s what I’d’ve done,”
persisted Kingsley, “ ’specially with the Daily Prophet having a go at
him every few days. . . .”
Harry did not look around; he did not want Lupin or Kingsley to
know he had heard. He followed Mundungus back toward the table,
though not remotely hungry. His pleasure in the party had evaporated
as quickly as it had come; he wished he were upstairs in bed.
Mad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained
of his nose; evidently he could not detect any trace of poison, because
he then tore a strip off it with his teeth.


MRS. WEASLEY
“. . . the handle’s made of Spanish oak with anti-jinx varnish and
in-built vibration control —” Ron was saying to Tonks.
Mrs. Weasley yawned widely.
“Well, I think I’ll sort out that boggart before I turn in. . . . Arthur,
I don’t want this lot up too late, all right? ’Night, Harry, dear.”
She left the kitchen. Harry set down his plate and wondered
whether he could follow her without attracting attention.
“You all right, Potter?” grunted Moody.
“Yeah, fine,” lied Harry.
Moody took a swig from his hip flask, his electric blue eye staring
sideways at Harry.
“Come here, I’ve got something that might interest you,” he said.
From an inner pocket of his robes Moody pulled a very tattered old
Wizarding photograph.
“Original Order of the Phoenix,” growled Moody. “Found it last
night when I was looking for my spare Invisibility Cloak, seeing as
Podmore hasn’t had the manners to return my best one. . . . Thought
people might like to see it.”
Harry took the photograph. A small crowd of people, some waving
at him, others lifting their glasses, looked back up at him.
“There’s me,” said Moody unnecessarily, pointing at himself. The
Moody in the picture was unmistakable, though his hair was slightly
less gray and his nose was intact. “And there’s Dumbledore beside me,
Dedalus Diggle on the other side . . . That’s Marlene McKinnon, she
was killed two weeks after this was taken, they got her whole family.
That’s Frank and Alice Longbottom —”
Harry’s stomach, already uncomfortable, clenched as he looked at
Alice Longbottom; he knew her round, friendly face very well, even
though he had never met her, because she was the image of her son,
Neville.
“Poor devils,” growled Moody. “Better dead than what happened


CHAPTER NINE
to them . . . and that’s Emmeline Vance, you’ve met her, and that
there’s Lupin, obviously . . . Benjy Fenwick, he copped it too, we only
ever found bits of him . . . shift aside there,” he added, poking the pic-
ture, and the little photographic people edged sideways, so that those
who were partially obscured could move to the front.
“That’s Edgar Bones . . . brother of Amelia Bones, they got him and
his family too, he was a great wizard . . . Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he
looks young . . . Caradoc Dearborn, vanished six months after this, we
never found his body . . . Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the same as
ever . . . Elphias Doge, you’ve met him, I’d forgotten he used to wear
that stupid hat . . . Gideon Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to kill
him and his brother Fabian, they fought like heroes . . . budge along,
budge along . . .”
The little people in the photograph jostled among themselves, and
those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture.
“That’s Dumbledore’s brother, Aberforth, only time I ever met him,
strange bloke . . . That’s Dorcas Meadowes, Voldemort killed her per-
sonally . . . Sirius, when he still had short hair . . . and . . . there you
go, thought that would interest you!”
Harry’s heart turned over. His mother and father were beaming up
at him, sitting on either side of a small, watery-eyed man Harry rec-
ognized at once as Wormtail: He was the one who had betrayed their
whereabouts to Voldemort and so helped bring about their deaths.
“Eh?” said Moody.
Harry looked up into Moody’s heavily scarred and pitted face. Evi-
dently Moody was under the impression he had just given Harry a bit
of a treat.
“Yeah,” said Harry, attempting to grin again. “Er . . . listen, I’ve
just remembered, I haven’t packed my . . .”
He was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not
packed; Sirius had just said, “What’s that you’ve got there, Mad-Eye?”
and Moody had turned toward him. Harry crossed the kitchen,

174
THE WOES OF
MRS. WEASLEY
slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call
him back.
He did not know why he had received such a shock; he had seen his
parents’ pictures before, after all, and he had met Wormtail . . . but to
have them sprung on him like that, when he was least expecting it . . .
No one would like that, he thought angrily. . . .
And then, to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces
. . . Benjy Fenwick, who had been found in bits, and Gideon Prewett,
who had died like a hero, and the Longbottoms, who had been tor-
tured into madness . . . all waving happily out of the photograph
forevermore, not knowing that they were doomed. . . . Well, Moody
might find that interesting . . . he, Harry, found it disturbing. . . .
Harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elf heads,
glad to be on his own again, but as he approached the first landing he
heard noises. Someone was sobbing in the drawing room.
“Hello?” Harry said.
There was no answer but the sobbing continued. He climbed the
remaining stairs two at a time, walked across the landing, and opened
the drawing-room door.
Someone was cowering against the dark wall, her wand in her
hand, her whole body shaking with sobs. Sprawled on the dusty old
carpet in a patch of moonlight, clearly dead, was Ron.
All the air seemed to vanish from Harry’s lungs; he felt as though he
were falling through the floor; his brain turned icy cold — Ron dead,
no, it couldn’t be —
But wait a moment, it couldn’t be — Ron was downstairs —
“Mrs. Weasley?” Harry croaked.
“R-r-riddikulus!’’ Mrs. Weasley sobbed, pointing her shaking wand
at Ron’s body.
Crack.
Ron’s body turned into Bill’s, spread-eagled on his back, his eyes
wide open and empty. Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever.

175
CHAPTER NINE
“R-riddikulus!” she sobbed again.
Crack.
Mr. Weasley’s body replaced Bill’s, his glasses askew, a trickle of
blood running down his face.
“No!” Mrs. Weasley moaned. “No . . . riddikulus! Riddikulus!
RIDDIKULUS !”
Crack. Dead twins. Crack. Dead Percy. Crack. Dead Harry . . .
“Mrs. Weasley, just get out of here!” shouted Harry, staring down
at his own dead body on the floor. “Let someone else —”
“What’s going on?”
Lupin had come running into the room, closely followed by Sirius,
with Moody stumping along behind them. Lupin looked from Mrs.
Weasley to the dead Harry on the floor and seemed to understand in
an instant. Pulling out his own wand he said, very firmly and clearly,
“Riddikulus!”
Harry’s body vanished. A silvery orb hung in the air over the spot
where it had lain. Lupin waved his wand once more and the orb van-
ished in a puff of smoke.
“Oh — oh — oh!” gulped Mrs. Weasley, and she broke into a
storm of crying, her face in her hands.
“Molly,” said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her, “Molly, don’t . . .”
Next second she was sobbing her heart out on Lupin’s shoulder.
“Molly, it was just a boggart,” he said soothingly, patting her on the
head. “Just a stupid boggart . . .”
“I see them d-d-dead all the time!” Mrs. Weasley moaned into his
shoulder. “All the t-t-time! I d-d-dream about it . . .”
Sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart, pre-
tending to be Harry’s body, had lain. Moody was looking at Harry,
who avoided his gaze. He had a funny feeling Moody’s magical eye
had followed him all the way out of the kitchen.
“D-d-don’t tell Arthur,” Mrs. Weasley was gulping now, mopping

176
THE WOES OF
MRS. WEASLEY
her eyes frantically with her cuffs. “I d-d-don’t want him to know. . . .
Being silly . . .”
Lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose.
“Harry, I’m so sorry, what must you think of me?” she said shakily.
“Not even able to get rid of a boggart . . .”
“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry, trying to smile.
“I’m just s-s-so worried,” she said, tears spilling out of her eyes
again. “Half the f-f-family’s in the Order, it’ll b-b-be a miracle if we all
come through this. . . . and P-P-Percy’s not talking to us. . . . What if
something d-d-dreadful happens and we had never m-m-made up?
And what’s going to happen if Arthur and I get killed, who’s g-g-going
to look after Ron and Ginny?”
“Molly, that’s enough,” said Lupin firmly. “This isn’t like last time.
The Order is better prepared, we’ve got a head start, we know what
Voldemort’s up to —”
Mrs. Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name.
“Oh, Molly, come on, it’s about time you got used to hearing it —
look, I can’t promise no one’s going to get hurt, nobody can promise
that, but we’re much better off than we were last time, you weren’t in
the Order then, you don’t understand, last time we were outnumbered
twenty to one by the Death Eaters and they were picking us off one by
one. . . .”
Harry thought of the photograph again, of his parents’ beaming
faces. He knew Moody was still watching him.
“Don’t worry about Percy,” said Sirius abruptly. “He’ll come round.
It’s a matter of time before Voldemort moves into the open; once he
does, the whole Ministry’s going to be begging us to forgive them.
And I’m not sure I’ll be accepting their apology,” he added bitterly.
“And as for who’s going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and
Arthur died,” said Lupin, smiling slightly, “what do you think we’d
do, let them starve?”

177
CHAPTER NINE
Mrs. Weasley smiled tremulously.
“Being silly,” she muttered again, mopping her eyes.
But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes
later, could not think Mrs. Weasley silly. He could still see his parents
beaming up at him from the tattered old photograph, unaware that
their lives, like so many of those around them, were drawing to a close.
The image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of Mrs.
Weasley’s family in turn kept flashing before his eyes.
Without warning, the scar on his forehead seared with pain again
and his stomach churned horribly.
“Cut it out,” he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded
again.
“First sign of madness, talking to your own head,” said a sly voice
from the empty picture on the wall.
Harry ignored it. He felt older than he had ever felt in his life, and
it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been
worried about a joke shop and who had gotten a prefect’s badge.

H
arry had a troubled night’s sleep. His parents wove in and out
of his dreams, never speaking; Mrs. Weasley sobbed over
Kreacher’s dead body watched by Ron and Hermione, who were wear-
ing crowns, and yet again Harry found himself walking down a corri-
dor ending in a locked door. He awoke abruptly with his scar
prickling to find Ron already dressed and talking to him.
“. . . better hurry up, Mum’s going ballistic, she says we’re going to
miss the train. . . .”
There was a lot of commotion in the house. From what he heard as
he dressed at top speed, Harry gathered that Fred and George had be-
witched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying
them, with the result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and
knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mrs. Black and
Mrs. Weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices.
“— COULD HAVE DONE HER A SERIOUS INJURY, YOU
IDIOTS —”
“— FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BESMIRCHING THE HOUSE
OF MY FATHERS —”


CHAPTER TEN
Hermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered just as
Harry was putting on his trainers; Hedwig was swaying on her shoul-
der, and she was carrying a squirming Crookshanks in her arms.
“Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig back” — the owl fluttered oblig-
ingly over and perched on top of her cage — “are you ready yet?”
“Nearly — Ginny all right?” Harry asked, shoving on his glasses.
“Mrs. Weasley’s patched her up,” said Hermione. “But now Mad-
Eye’s complaining that we can’t leave unless Sturgis Podmore’s here,
otherwise the guard will be one short.”
“Guard?” said Harry. “We have to go to King’s Cross with a guard?”
“You have to go to King’s Cross with a guard,” Hermione corrected
him.
“Why?” said Harry irritably. “I thought Voldemort was supposed
to be lying low, or are you telling me he’s going to jump out from
behind a dustbin to try and do me in?”
“I don’t know, it’s just what Mad-Eye says,” said Hermione
distractedly, looking at her watch. “But if we don’t leave soon we’re
definitely going to miss the train. . . .”
“WILL YOU LOT GET DOWN HERE NOW, PLEASE!” Mrs.
Weasley bellowed and Hermione jumped as though scalded and
hurried out of the room. Harry seized Hedwig, stuffed her unceremo-
niously into her cage, and set off downstairs after Hermione, dragging
his trunk.
Mrs. Black’s portrait was howling with rage but nobody was both-
ering to close the curtains over her; all the noise in the hall was bound
to rouse her again anyway.
“Harry, you’re to come with me and Tonks,” shouted Mrs. Weasley
over the repeated screeches of “MUDBLOODS ! SCUM ! CREATURES
OF DIRT !” “Leave your trunk and your owl, Alastor’s going to deal with
the luggage. . . . Oh, for heaven’s sake, Sirius, Dumbledore said no!”
A bearlike black dog had appeared at Harry’s side as Harry clam-

180
LUNA LOVEGOOD
bered over the various trunks cluttering the hall to get to Mrs.
Weasley.
“Oh honestly . . .” said Mrs. Weasley despairingly, “well, on your
own head be it!”
She wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak
September sunlight. Harry and the dog followed her. The door
slammed behind them and Mrs. Black’s screeches were cut off
instantly.
“Where’s Tonks?” Harry said, looking around as they went down
the stone steps of number twelve, which vanished the moment they
reached the pavement.
“She’s waiting for us just up here,” said Mrs. Weasley stiffly, avert-
ing her eyes from the lolloping black dog beside Harry.
An old woman greeted them on the corner. She had tightly curled
gray hair and wore a purple hat shaped like a porkpie.
“Wotcher, Harry,” she said, winking. “Better hurry up, hadn’t we,
Molly?” she added, checking her watch.
“I know, I know,” moaned Mrs. Weasley, lengthening her stride,
“but Mad-Eye wanted to wait for Sturgis. . . . If only Arthur could
have got us cars from the Ministry again . . . but Fudge wouldn’t let
him borrow so much as an empty ink bottle these days. . . . How
Muggles can stand traveling without magic . . .”
But the great black dog gave a joyful bark and gamboled around
them, snapping at pigeons, and chasing its own tail. Harry couldn’t
help laughing. Sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time.
Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips in an almost Aunt Petunia-ish way.
It took them twenty minutes to reach King’s Cross by foot and
nothing more eventful happened during that time than Sirius scaring
a couple of cats for Harry’s entertainment. Once inside the station
they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and
ten until the coast was clear, then each of them leaned against it in


CHAPTER TEN
turn and fell easily through onto platform nine and three quarters,
where the Hogwarts Express stood belching sooty steam over a plat-
form packed with departing students and their families. Harry inhaled
the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really going
back. . . .
“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously,
staring behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform,
through which new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail
frantically.
“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, “here’s Alastor
with the luggage, look . . .”
A porter’s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came
limping through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks.
“All okay,” he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. “Don’t think
we were followed. . . .”
Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform with Ron
and Hermione. They had almost unloaded Moody’s luggage cart
when Fred, George, and Ginny turned up with Lupin.
“No trouble?” growled Moody.
“Nothing,” said Lupin.
“I’ll still be reporting Sturgis to Dumbledore,” said Moody. “That’s
the second time he’s not turned up in a week. Getting as unreliable as
Mundungus.”
“Well, look after yourselves,” said Lupin, shaking hands all round.
He reached Harry last and gave him a clap on the shoulder. “You too,
Harry. Be careful.”
“Yeah, keep your head down and your eyes peeled,” said Moody,
shaking Harry’s hand too. “And don’t forget, all of you — careful
what you put in writing. If in doubt, don’t put it in a letter at all.”

182
LUNA LOVEGOOD
“It’s been great meeting all of you,” said Tonks, hugging Hermione
and Ginny. “We’ll see you soon, I expect.”
A warning whistle sounded; the students still on the platform
started hurrying onto the train.
“Quick, quick,” said Mrs. Weasley distractedly, hugging them at ran-
dom and catching Harry twice. “Write. . . . Be good. . . . If you’ve for-
gotten anything we’ll send it on. . . . Onto the train, now, hurry. . . .”
For one brief moment, the great black dog reared onto its hind legs
and placed its front paws on Harry’s shoulders, but Mrs. Weasley
shoved Harry away toward the train door hissing, “For heaven’s sake
act more like a dog, Sirius!”
“See you!” Harry called out of the open window as the train began
to move, while Ron, Hermione, and Ginny waved beside him. The
figures of Tonks, Lupin, Moody, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley shrank
rapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window, wag-
ging its tail; blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it
chasing the train, and then they turned the corner, and Sirius was
gone.
“He shouldn’t have come with us,” said Hermione in a worried
voice.
“Oh lighten up,” said Ron, “he hasn’t seen daylight for months,
poor bloke.”
“Well,” said Fred, clapping his hands together, “can’t stand around
chatting all day, we’ve got business to discuss with Lee. See you later,”
and he and George disappeared down the corridor to the right.
The train was gathering still more speed, so that the houses outside
the window flashed past and they swayed where they stood.
“Shall we go and find a compartment, then?” Harry asked Ron and
Hermione.
Ron and Hermione exchanged looks.
“Er,” said Ron.

183
CHAPTER TEN
“We’re — well — Ron and I are supposed to go into the prefect
carriage,” Hermione said awkwardly.
Ron wasn’t looking at Harry; he seemed to have become intensely
interested in the fingernails on his left hand.
“Oh,” said Harry. “Right. Fine.”
“I don’t think we’ll have to stay there all journey,” said Hermione
quickly. “Our letters said we just get instructions from the Head Boy
and Girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time.”
“Fine,” said Harry again. “Well, I-I might see you later, then.”
“Yeah, definitely,” said Ron, casting a shifty, anxious look at Harry.
“It’s a pain having to go down there, I’d rather — but we have to — I
mean, I’m not enjoying it, I’m not Percy,” he finished defiantly.
“I know you’re not,” said Harry and he grinned. But as Hermione
and Ron dragged their trunks, Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon
off toward the engine end of the train, Harry felt an odd sense of loss.
He had never traveled on the Hogwarts Express without Ron.
“Come on,” Ginny told him, “if we get a move on we’ll be able to
save them places.”
“Right,” said Harry, picking up Hedwig’s cage in one hand and the
handle of his trunk in the other. They struggled off down the corridor,
peering through the glass-paneled doors into the compartments they
passed, which were already full. Harry could not help noticing that a
lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of
them nudged their neighbors and pointed him out. After he had met
this behavior in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the
Daily Prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying
show-off he was. He wondered bleakly whether the people now star-
ing and whispering believed the stories.
In the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, Harry’s fel-
low fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of
pulling his trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on his
struggling toad, Trevor.

184
LUNA LOVEGOOD
“Hi, Harry,” he panted. “Hi, Ginny. . . . Everywhere’s full. . . . I
can’t find a seat. . . .”
“What are you talking about?” said Ginny, who had squeezed past
Neville to peer into the compartment behind him. “There’s room in
this one, there’s only Loony Lovegood in here —”
Neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone.
“Don’t be silly,” said Ginny, laughing, “she’s all right.”
She slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside it. Harry and
Neville followed.
“Hi, Luna,” said Ginny. “Is it okay if we take these seats?”
The girl beside the window looked up. She had straggly, waist-
length, dirty-blond hair, very pale eyebrows, and protuberant eyes
that gave her a permanently surprised look. Harry knew at once why
Neville had chosen to pass this compartment by. The girl gave off an
aura of distinct dottiness. Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her
wand behind her left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to
wear a necklace of butterbeer caps, or that she was reading a magazine
upside down. Her eyes ranged over Neville and came to rest on Harry.
She nodded.
“Thanks,” said Ginny, smiling at her.
Harry and Neville stowed the three trunks and Hedwig’s cage in
the luggage rack and sat down. The girl called Luna watched them
over her upside-down magazine, which was called The Quibbler. She
did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans. She stared
and stared at Harry, who had taken the seat opposite her and now
wished he had not.
“Had a good summer, Luna?” Ginny asked.
“Yes,” said Luna dreamily, without taking her eyes off Harry. “Yes,
it was quite enjoyable, you know. You’re Harry Potter,” she added.
“I know I am,” said Harry.
Neville chuckled. Luna turned her pale eyes upon him instead.
“And I don’t know who you are.”

“I’m nobody,” said Neville hurriedly.
“No you’re not,” said Ginny sharply. “Neville Longbottom —
Luna Lovegood. Luna’s in my year, but in Ravenclaw.”
“Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure,” said Luna in a
singsong voice.
She raised her upside-down magazine high enough to hide her face
and fell silent. Harry and Neville looked at each other with their eye-
brows raised. Ginny suppressed a giggle.
The train rattled onward, speeding them out into open country. It
was an odd, unsettled sort of day; one moment the carriage was full of
sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously gray
clouds.
“Guess what I got for my birthday?” said Neville.
“Another Remembrall?” said Harry, remembering the marblelike
device Neville’s grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his
abysmal memory.
“No,” said Neville, “I could do with one, though, I lost the old one
ages ago. . . . No, look at this. . . .”
He dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on Trevor into
his schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what ap-
peared to be a small gray cactus in a pot, except that it was covered
with what looked like boils rather than spines.
“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” he said proudly.
Harry stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, giving it the
rather sinister look of some diseased internal organ.
“It’s really, really rare,” said Neville, beaming. “I don’t know if
there’s one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can’t wait to show
it to Professor Sprout. My great-uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria.
I’m going to see if I can breed from it.”
Harry knew that Neville’s favorite subject was Herbology, but for
the life of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted
little plant.

186
LUNA LOVEGOOD
“Does it — er — do anything?” he asked.
“Loads of stuff!” said Neville proudly. “It’s got an amazing defen-
sive mechanism — hold Trevor for me. . . .”
He dumped the toad into Harry’s lap and took a quill from his
schoolbag. Luna Lovegood’s popping eyes appeared over the top of
her upside-down magazine again, watching what Neville was doing.
Neville held the Mimbulus mimbletonia up to his eyes, his tongue be-
tween his teeth, chose his spot, and gave the plant a sharp prod with
the tip of his quill.
Liquid squirted from every boil on the plant, thick, stinking, dark-
green jets of it; they hit the ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna
Lovegood’s magazine. Ginny, who had flung her arms up in front of
her face just in time, merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy
green hat, but Harry, whose hands had been busy preventing the es-
cape of Trevor, received a face full. It smelled like rancid manure.
Neville, whose face and torso were also drenched, shook his head to
get the worst out of his eyes.
“S-sorry,” he gasped. “I haven’t tried that before. . . . Didn’t realize
it would be quite so . . . Don’t worry, though, Stinksap’s not poiso-
nous,” he added nervously, as Harry spat a mouthful onto the floor.
At that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open.
“Oh . . . hello, Harry,” said a nervous voice. “Um . . . bad time?”
Harry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his Trevor-free hand. A
very pretty girl with long, shiny black hair was standing in the doorway
smiling at him: Cho Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch
team.
“Oh . . . hi,” said Harry blankly.
“Um . . .” said Cho. “Well . . . just thought I’d say hello . . . ’bye
then.”
She closed the door again, rather pink in the face, and departed.
Harry slumped back in his seat and groaned. He would have liked
Cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing

187
CHAPTER TEN
their heads off at a joke he had just told; he would not have chosen to
be sitting with Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and
dripping in Stinksap.
“Never mind,” said Ginny bracingly. “Look, we can get rid of all
this easily.” She pulled out her wand. “Scourgify!”
The Stinksap vanished.
“Sorry,” said Neville again, in a small voice.
Ron and Hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which
time the food trolley had already gone by. Harry, Ginny, and Neville
had finished their Pumpkin Pasties and were busy swapping Choco-
late Frog cards when the compartment door slid open and they
walked in, accompanied by Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pig-
widgeon in his cage.
“I’m starving,” said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig,
grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Harry and throwing himself into the
seat next to him. He ripped open the wrapper, bit off the Frog’s head,
and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very ex-
hausting morning.
“Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each House,” said
Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat. “Boy
and girl from each.”
“And guess who’s a Slytherin prefect?” said Ron, still with his eyes
closed.
“Malfoy,” replied Harry at once, his worst fear confirmed.
“ ’Course,” said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of the Frog into his
mouth and taking another.
“And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,” said Hermione vicious-
ly. “How she got to be a prefect when she’s thicker than a concussed
troll . . .”
“Who’s Hufflepuff?” Harry asked.
“Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott,” said Ron thickly.

188
LUNA LOVEGOOD
“And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,” said
Hermione.
“You went to the Yule Ball with Padma Patil,” said a vague voice.
Everyone turned to look at Luna Lovegood, who was gazing un-
blinkingly at Ron over the top of The Quibbler. He swallowed his
mouthful of Frog.
“Yeah, I know I did,” he said, looking mildly surprised.
“She didn’t enjoy it very much,” Luna informed him. “She doesn’t
think you treated her very well, because you wouldn’t dance with her.
I don’t think I’d have minded,” she added thoughtfully, “I don’t like
dancing very much.”
She retreated behind The Quibbler again. Ron stared at the cover
with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds, then looked around
at Ginny for some kind of explanation, but Ginny had stuffed her
knuckles in her mouth to stop herself giggling. Ron shook his head,
bemused, then checked his watch.
“We’re supposed to patrol the corridors every so often,” he told
Harry and Neville, “and we can give out punishments if people are
misbehaving. I can’t wait to get Crabbe and Goyle for something. . . .”
“You’re not supposed to abuse your position, Ron!” said Hermione
sharply.
“Yeah, right, because Malfoy won’t abuse it at all,” said Ron
sarcastically.
“So you’re going to descend to his level?”
“No, I’m just going to make sure I get his mates before he gets
mine.”
“For heaven’s sake, Ron —”
“I’ll make Goyle do lines, it’ll kill him, he hates writing,” said Ron
happily. He lowered his voice to Goyle’s low grunt and, screwing up his
face in a look of pained concentration, mimed writing in midair. “I . . .
must . . . not . . . look . . . like . . . a . . . baboon’s . . . backside. . . .”


CHAPTER TEN
Everyone laughed, but nobody laughed harder than Luna Love-
good. She let out a scream of mirth that caused Hedwig to wake up
and flap her wings indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up into the
luggage rack, hissing. She laughed so hard that her magazine slipped
out of her grasp, slid down her legs, and onto the floor.
“That was funny!”
Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring
at Ron. Utterly nonplussed, he looked around at the others, who were
now laughing at the expression on Ron’s face and at the ludicrously
prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backward and
forward, clutching her sides.
“Are you taking the mickey?” said Ron, frowning at her.
“Baboon’s . . . backside!” she choked, holding her ribs.
Everyone else was watching Luna laughing, but Harry, glancing at
the magazine on the floor, noticed something that made him dive for
it. Upside down it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front
was, but Harry now realized it was a fairly bad cartoon of Cornelius
Fudge; Harry only recognized him because of the lime-green bowler
hat. One of Fudge’s hands was clenched around a bag of gold; the
other hand was throttling a goblin. The cartoon was captioned: How
Far Will Fudge Go to Gain Gringotts?
Beneath this were listed the titles of other articles inside the magazine.
CORRUPTION IN THE QUIDDITCH LEAGUE:
How the Tornados Are Taking Control
SECRETS OF THE ANCIENT RUNES REVEALED
SIRIUS BLACK: Villain or Victim?
“Can I have a look at this?” Harry asked Luna eagerly.
She nodded, still gazing at Ron, breathless with laughter.


LUNA LOVEGOOD
Harry opened the magazine and scanned the index; until this mo-
ment he had completely forgotten the magazine Kingsley had handed
Mr. Weasley to give to Sirius, but it must have been this edition of The
Quibbler. He found the page and turned excitedly to the article.
This too was illustrated by a rather bad cartoon; in fact, Harry
would not have known it was supposed to be Sirius if it hadn’t been
captioned. Sirius was standing on a pile of human bones with his
wand out. The headline on the article read:
SIRIUS - Black As He’s Painted?
Notorious Mass Murderer OR Innocent Singing Sensation?
Harry had to read this sentence several times before he was con-
vinced that he had not misunderstood it. Since when had Sirius been
a singing sensation?
For fourteen years Sirius Black has been believed
guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent Mug-
gles and one wizard. Black’s audacious escape from
Azkaban two years ago has led to the widest man-
hunt ever conducted by the Ministry of Magic. None
of us has ever questioned that he deserves to be re-
captured and handed back to the dementors.
BUT DOES HE?
Startling new evidence has recently come to light
that Sirius Black may not have committed the crimes
for which he was sent to Azkaban. In fact, says Doris
Purkiss, of 18 Acanthia Way, Little Norton, Black may
not even have been present at the killings.
“What people don’t realize is that Sirius Black is
a false name,” says Mrs. Purkiss. “The man people

191
CHAPTER TEN
believe to be Sirius Black is actually Stubby Board-
man, lead singer of the popular singing group The
Hobgoblins, who retired from public life after being
struck in the ear by a turnip at a concert in Little Nor-
ton Church Hall nearly fifteen years ago. I recognized
him the moment I saw his picture in the paper. Now,
Stubby couldn’t possibly have committed those
crimes, because on the day in question he happened
to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me. I
have written to the Minister of Magic and am expect-
ing him to give Stubby, alias Sirius, a full pardon any
day now.”
Harry finished reading and stared at the page in disbelief. Perhaps
it was a joke, he thought, perhaps the magazine often printed spoof
items. He flicked back a few pages and found the piece on Fudge.
Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, denied that
he had any plans to take over the running of the Wiz-
arding Bank, Gringotts, when he was elected Minister
of Magic five years ago. Fudge has always insisted
that he wants nothing more than to “cooperate
peacefully” with the guardians of our gold.
BUT DOES HE?
Sources close to the Minister have recently dis-
closed that Fudge’s dearest ambition is to seize
control of the goblin gold supplies and that he will
not hesitate to use force if need be.
“It wouldn’t be the first time, either,” said a
Ministry insider. “Cornelius ‘Goblin-Crusher’ Fudge,
that’s what his friends call him, if you could hear him

192
LUNA LOVEGOOD
when he thinks no one’s listening, oh, he’s always
talking about the goblins he’s had done in; he’s had
them drowned, he’s had them dropped off buildings,
he’s had them poisoned, he’s had them cooked in
pies. . . .”
Harry did not read any further. Fudge might have many faults but
Harry found it extremely hard to imagine him ordering goblins to be
cooked in pies. He flicked through the rest of the magazine. Pausing
every few pages he read an accusation that the Tutshill Tornados were
winning the Quidditch League by a combination of blackmail, illegal
broom-tampering, and torture; an interview with a wizard who
claimed to have flown to the moon on a Cleansweep Six and brought
back a bag of moon frogs to prove it; and an article on ancient runes,
which at least explained why Luna had been reading The Quibbler up-
side down. According to the magazine, if you turned the runes on
their heads they revealed a spell to make your enemy’s ears turn into
kumquats. In fact, compared to the rest of the articles in The Quibbler,
the suggestion that Sirius might really be the lead singer of The Hob-
goblins was quite sensible.
“Anything good in there?” asked Ron as Harry closed the magazine.
“Of course not,” said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could an-
swer, “The Quibbler’s rubbish, everyone knows that.”
“Excuse me,” said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy
quality. “My father’s the editor.”
“I — oh,” said Hermione, looking embarrassed. “Well . . . it’s got
some interesting . . . I mean, it’s quite . . .”
“I’ll have it back, thank you,” said Luna coldly, and leaning forward
she snatched it out of Harry’s hands. Rifling through it to page fifty-
seven, she turned it resolutely upside down again and disappeared
behind it, just as the compartment door opened for the third time.

193
CHAPTER TEN
Harry looked around; he had expected this, but that did not make the
sight of Draco Malfoy smirking at him from between his cronies
Crabbe and Goyle any more enjoyable.
“What?” he said aggressively, before Malfoy could open his mouth.
“Manners, Potter, or I’ll have to give you a detention,” drawled
Malfoy, whose sleek blond hair and pointed chin were just like his
father’s. “You see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which
means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and
leave us alone.”
Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville laughed. Malfoy’s lip curled.
“Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?” he
asked.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” said Hermione sharply.
“I seem to have touched a nerve,” said Malfoy, smirking. “Well, just
watch yourself, Potter, because I’ll be dogging your footsteps in case
you step out of line.”
“Get out!” said Hermione, standing up.
Sniggering, Malfoy gave Harry a last malicious look and departed,
Crabbe and Goyle lumbering in his wake. Hermione slammed the
compartment door behind them and turned to look at Harry, who
knew at once that she, like him, had registered what Malfoy had said
and been just as unnerved by it.
“Chuck us another Frog,” said Ron, who had clearly noticed
nothing.
Harry could not talk freely in front of Neville and Luna. He ex-
changed another nervous look with Hermione and then stared out of
the window.
He had thought Sirius coming with him to the station was a bit of
a laugh, but suddenly it seemed reckless, if not downright dangerous.
. . . Hermione had been right. . . . Sirius should not have come. What
if Mr. Malfoy had noticed the black dog and told Draco, what if he

194
LUNA LOVEGOOD
had deduced that the Weasleys, Lupin, Tonks, and Moody knew
where Sirius was hiding? Or had Malfoy’s use of the word “dogging”
been a coincidence?
The weather remained undecided as they traveled farther and far-
ther north. Rain spattered the windows in a halfhearted way, then the
sun put in a feeble appearance before clouds drifted over it once more.
When darkness fell and lamps came on inside the carriages, Luna
rolled up The Quibbler, put it carefully away in her bag, and took to
staring at everyone in the compartment instead.
Harry was sitting with his forehead pressed against the train win-
dow, trying to get a first distant glimpse of Hogwarts, but it was a
moonless night and the rain-streaked window was grimy.
“We’d better change,” said Hermione at last. She and Ron pinned
their prefect badges carefully to their chests. Harry saw Ron checking
how it looked in the black window.
At last the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket
up and down it as everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pets
assembled, ready for departure. Ron and Hermione were supposed to
supervise all this; they disappeared from the carriage again, leaving
Harry and the others to look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon.
“I’ll carry that owl, if you like,” said Luna to Harry, reaching out
for Pigwidgeon as Neville stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket.
“Oh — er — thanks,” said Harry, handing her the cage and hoist-
ing Hedwig’s more securely into his arms.
They shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the
night air on their faces as they joined the crowd in the corridor. Slowly
they moved toward the doors. Harry could smell the pine trees that
lined the path down to the lake. He stepped down onto the platform
and looked around, listening for the familiar call of “Firs’ years over
here . . . firs’ years . . .”
But it did not come. Instead a quite different voice, a brisk female

195
CHAPTER TEN
one, was calling, “First years line up over here, please! All first years to
me!”
A lantern came swinging toward Harry and by its light he saw the
prominent chin and severe haircut of Professor Grubbly-Plank, the
witch who had taken over Hagrid’s Care of Magical Creatures lessons
for a while the previous year.
“Where’s Hagrid?” he said out loud.
“I don’t know,” said Ginny, “but we’d better get out of the way,
we’re blocking the door.”
“Oh yeah . . .”
Harry and Ginny became separated as they moved off along the
platform and out through the station. Jostled by the crowd, Harry
squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of Hagrid; he had to be
here, Harry had been relying on it — seeing Hagrid again had been
one of the things to which he had been looking forward most. But
there was no sign of him at all.
He can’t have left, Harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through
a narrow doorway onto the road outside with the rest of the crowd.
He’s just got a cold or something. . . .
He looked around for Ron or Hermione, wanting to know what
they thought about the reappearance of Professor Grubbly-Plank, but
neither of them was anywhere near him, so he allowed himself to be
shunted forward onto the dark rain-washed road outside Hogsmeade
station.
Here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always
took the students above first year up to the castle. Harry glanced
quickly at them, turned away to keep a lookout for Ron and
Hermione, then did a double take.
The coaches were no longer horseless. There were creatures stand-
ing between the carriage shafts; if he had had to give them a name, he
supposed he would have called them horses, though there was some-
thing reptilian about them, too. They were completely fleshless, their

196
LUNA LOVEGOOD
black coats clinging to their skeletons, of which every bone was visi-
ble. Their heads were dragonish, and their pupil-less eyes white and
staring. Wings sprouted from each wither — vast, black leathery
wings that looked as though they ought to belong to giant bats.
Standing still and quiet in the gloom, the creatures looked eerie and
sinister. Harry could not understand why the coaches were being
pulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of
moving along by themselves.
“Where’s Pig?” said Ron’s voice, right behind Harry.
“That Luna girl was carrying him,” said Harry, turning quickly, ea-
ger to consult Ron about Hagrid. “Where d’you reckon —”
“— Hagrid is? I dunno,” said Ron, sounding worried. “He’d better
be okay. . . .”
A short distance away, Draco Malfoy, followed by a small gang of
cronies including Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson, was pushing
some timid-looking second years out of the way so that they could get
a coach to themselves. Seconds later Hermione emerged panting from
the crowd.
“Malfoy was being absolutely foul to a first year back there, I swear
I’m going to report him, he’s only had his badge three minutes and he’s
using it to bully people worse than ever. . . . Where’s Crookshanks?”
“Ginny’s got him,” said Harry. “There she is. . . .”
Ginny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a squirming
Crookshanks.
“Thanks,” said Hermione, relieving Ginny of the cat. “Come on,
let’s get a carriage together before they all fill up. . . .”
“I haven’t got Pig yet!” Ron said, but Hermione was already head-
ing off toward the nearest unoccupied coach. Harry remained behind
with Ron.
“What are those things, d’you reckon?” he asked Ron, nodding at
the horrible horses as the other students surged past them.
“What things?”

197
CHAPTER TEN
“Those horse —”
Luna appeared holding Pigwidgeon’s cage in her arms; the tiny owl
was twittering excitedly as usual.
“Here you are,” she said. “He’s a sweet little owl, isn’t he?”
“Er . . . yeah . . . He’s all right,” said Ron gruffly. “Well, come on
then, let’s get in. . . . what were you saying, Harry?”
“I was saying, what are those horse things?” Harry said, as he, Ron,
and Luna made for the carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were
already sitting.
“What horse things?”
“The horse things pulling the carriages!” said Harry impatiently;
they were, after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was
watching them with empty white eyes. Ron, however, gave Harry a
perplexed look.
“What are you talking about?”
“I’m talking about — look!”
Harry grabbed Ron’s arm and wheeled him about so that he was
face-to-face with the winged horse. Ron stared straight at it for a sec-
ond, then looked back at Harry.
“What am I supposed to be looking at?”
“At the — there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! It’s
right there in front —”
But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred
to Harry.
“Can’t . . . can’t you see them?”
“See what?”
“Can’t you see what’s pulling the carriages?”
Ron looked seriously alarmed now.
“Are you feeling all right, Harry?”
“I . . . yeah . . .”
Harry felt utterly bewildered. The horse was there in front of him,
gleaming solidly in the dim light issuing from the station windows

198
LUNA LOVEGOOD
behind them, vapor rising from its nostrils in the chilly night air. Yet
unless Ron was faking — and it was a very feeble joke if he was —
Ron could not see it at all.
“Shall we get in, then?” said Ron uncertainly, looking at Harry as
though worried about him.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, go on . . .”
“It’s all right,” said a dreamy voice from beside Harry as Ron van-
ished into the coach’s dark interior. “You’re not going mad or anything.
I can see them too.”
“Can you?” said Harry desperately, turning to Luna. He could see
the bat-winged horses reflected in her wide, silvery eyes.
“Oh yes,” said Luna, “I’ve been able to see them ever since my first
day here. They’ve always pulled the carriages. Don’t worry. You’re just
as sane as I am.”
Smiling faintly, she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage
after Ron. Not altogether reassured, Harry followed her.

H
arry did not want to tell the others that he and Luna were
having the same hallucination, if that was what it was, so he
said nothing about the horses as he sat down inside the carriage and
slammed the door behind him. Nevertheless, he could not help
watching the silhouettes of the horses moving beyond the window.
“Did everyone see that Grubbly-Plank woman?” asked Ginny.
“What’s she doing back here? Hagrid can’t have left, can he?”
“I’ll be quite glad if he has,” said Luna. “He isn’t a very good
teacher, is he?”
“Yes, he is!” said Harry, Ron, and Ginny angrily.
Harry glared at Hermione; she cleared her throat and quickly said,
“Erm . . . yes . . . he’s very good.”
“Well, we think he’s a bit of a joke in Ravenclaw,” said Luna,
unfazed.
“You’ve got a rubbish sense of humor then,” Ron snapped, as the
wheels below them creaked into motion.
Luna did not seem perturbed by Ron’s rudeness; on the contrary,

200
THE SORTING HAT’S
NEW SONG
she simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly inter-
esting television program.
Rattling and swaying, the carriages moved in convoy up the road.
When they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged
boars on either side of the gates to the school grounds, Harry leaned
forward to try and see whether there were any lights on in Hagrid’s
cabin by the Forbidden Forest, but the grounds were in complete
darkness. Hogwarts Castle, however, loomed ever closer: a towering
mass of turrets, jet-black against the dark sky, here and there a window
blazing fiery bright above them.
The carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the
oak front doors and Harry got out of the carriage first. He turned
again to look for lit windows down by the forest, but there was defi-
nitely no sign of life within Hagrid’s cabin. Unwillingly, because he
had half hoped they would have vanished, he turned his eyes instead
upon the strange, skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night
air, their blank white eyes gleaming.
Harry had once before had the experience of seeing something that
Ron could not, but that had been a reflection in a mirror, something
much more insubstantial than a hundred very solid-looking beasts
strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages. If Luna was to be believed,
the beasts had always been there but invisible; why, then, could Harry
suddenly see them, and why could Ron not?
“Are you coming or what?” said Ron beside him.
“Oh . . . yeah,” said Harry quickly, and they joined the crowd hur-
rying up the stone steps into the castle.
The entrance hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with foot-
steps as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double
doors to the right, leading to the Great Hall and the start-of-term
feast.
The four long House tables in the Great Hall were filling up under

201
CHAPTER ELEVEN
the starless black ceiling, which was just like the sky they could
glimpse through the high windows. Candles floated in midair all
along the tables, illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted
about the Hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly to one an-
other, exchanging summer news, shouting greetings at friends from
other Houses, eyeing one another’s new haircuts and robes. Again
Harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as he
passed; he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither no-
ticed nor cared.
Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table. The moment
they reached Gryffindor’s, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth
years and left to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville
found seats together about halfway down the table between Nearly
Headless Nick, the Gryffindor House ghost, and Parvati Patil and
Lavender Brown, the last two of whom gave Harry airy, overly
friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had stopped talking
about him a split second before. He had more important things to
worry about, however: He was looking over the students’ heads to the
staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.
“He’s not there.”
Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was
no real need; Hagrid’s size made him instantly obvious in any lineup.
“He can’t have left,” said Ron, sounding slightly anxious.
“Of course he hasn’t,” said Harry firmly.
“You don’t think he’s . . . hurt, or anything, do you?” said Hermione
uneasily.
“No,” said Harry at once.
“But where is he, then?”
There was a pause, then Harry said very quietly, so that Neville,
Parvati, and Lavender could not hear, “Maybe he’s not back yet. You
know — from his mission — the thing he was doing over the sum-
mer for Dumbledore.”


THE SORTING HAT’S
NEW SONG
“Yeah . . . yeah, that’ll be it,” said Ron, sounding reassured, but
Hermione bit her lip, looking up and down the staff table as though
hoping for some conclusive explanation of Hagrid’s absence.
“Who’s that?” she said sharply, pointing toward the middle of the
staff table.
Harry’s eyes followed hers. They lit first upon Professor Dumble-
dore, sitting in his high-backed golden chair at the center of the long
staff table, wearing deep-purple robes scattered with silvery stars and
a matching hat. Dumbledore’s head was inclined toward the woman
sitting next to him, who was talking into his ear. She looked, Harry
thought, like somebody’s maiden aunt: squat, with short, curly,
mouse-brown hair in which she had placed a horrible pink Alice band
that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she wore over her robes. Then
she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw,
with a shock of recognition, a pallid, toadlike face and a pair of promi-
nent, pouchy eyes.
“It’s that Umbridge woman!”
“Who?” said Hermione.
“She was at my hearing, she works for Fudge!”
“Nice cardigan,” said Ron, smirking.
“She works for Fudge?” Hermione repeated, frowning. “What on
earth’s she doing here, then?”
“Dunno . . .”
Hermione scanned the staff table, her eyes narrowed.
“No,” she muttered, “no, surely not . . .”
Harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not
ask; his attention had just been caught by Professor Grubbly-Plank
who had just appeared behind the staff table; she worked her way
along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been Ha-
grid’s. That meant that the first years must have crossed the lake and
reached the castle, and sure enough, a few seconds later, the doors
from the entrance hall opened. A long line of scared-looking first years

203
CHAPTER ELEVEN
entered, led by Professor McGonagall, who was carrying a stool on
which sat an ancient wizard’s hat, heavily patched and darned with a
wide rip near the frayed brim.
The buzz of talk in the Great Hall faded away. The first years lined
up in front of the staff table facing the rest of the students, and Pro-
fessor McGonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them, then
stood back.
The first years’ faces glowed palely in the candlelight. A small boy
right in the middle of the row looked as though he was trembling.
Harry recalled, fleetingly, how terrified he had felt when he had stood
there, waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which
House he belonged.
The whole school waited with bated breath. Then the rip near the
hat’s brim opened wide like a mouth and the Sorting Hat burst into
song:
In times of old when I was new
And Hogwarts barely started
The founders of our noble school
Thought never to be parted:
United by a common goal,
They had the selfsame yearning,
To make the world’s best magic school
And pass along their learning.
“Together we will build and teach!”
The four good friends decided
And never did they dream that they
Might someday be divided,
For were there such friends anywhere
As Slytherin and Gryffndor?
Unless it was the second pair
Of Huffepuff and Ravenclaw?

204
THE SORTING HAT’S
NEW SONG
So how could it have gone so wrong?
How could such friendships fail?
Why, I was there and so can tell
The whole sad, sorry tale.
Said Slytherin, “We’ll teach just those
Whose ancestry is purest.”
Said Ravenclaw, “We’ll teach those whose
Intelligence is surest.”
Said Gryffindor, “We’ll teach all those
With brave deeds to their name,”
Said Hufflepujf, “I’ll teach the lot,
And treat them just the same.”
These differences caused little strife
When first they came to light,
For each of the four founders had
A House in which they might
Take only those they wanted, so,
For instance, Slytherin
Took only pure-blood wizards
Of great cunning, just like him,
And only those of sharpest mind
Were taught by Ravenclaw
While the bravest and the boldest
Went to daring Gryffindor.
Good Hufflepujf she took the rest,
And taught them all she knew,
Thus the Houses and their founders
Retained friendships firm and true.
So Hogwarts worked in harmony
For several happy years,
But then discord crept among us
Feeding on our faults and fears.

205
CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Houses that, like pillars four,
Had once held up our school,
Now turned upon each other and,
Divided, sought to rule.
And for a while it seemed the school
Must meet an early end,
What with dueling and with fighting
And the clash of friend on friend
And at last there came a morning
When old Slytherin departed
And though the fighting then died out
He left us quite downhearted.
And never since the founders four
Were whittled down to three
Have the Houses been united
As they once were meant to be.
And now the Sorting Hat is here
And you all know the score:
I sort you into Houses
Because that is what I’m for,
But this year I’ll go further,
Listen closely to my song:
Though condemned I am to split you
Still I worry that it’s wrong,
Though I must fulfill my duty
And must quarter every year
Still I wonder whether sorting
May not bring the end I fear.
Oh, know the perils, read the signs,
The warning history shows,
For our Hogwarts is in danger
From external, deadly foes

206
THE SORTING HAT’S
NEW SONG
And we must unite inside her
Or we’ll crumble from within.
I have told you, I have warned you. . . .
Let the Sorting now begin.
The hat became motionless once more; applause broke out, though
it was punctured, for the first time in Harry’s memory, with mutter-
ing and whispers. All across the Great Hall students were exchanging
remarks with their neighbors and Harry, clapping along with every-
one else, knew exactly what they were talking about.
“Branched out a bit this year, hasn’t it?” said Ron, his eyebrows
raised.
“Too right it has,” said Harry.
The Sorting Hat usually confined itself to describing the different
qualities looked for by each of the four Hogwarts Houses and its own
role in sorting them; Harry could not remember it ever trying to give
the school advice before.
“I wonder if it’s ever given warnings before?” said Hermione,
sounding slightly anxious.
“Yes, indeed,” said Nearly Headless Nick knowledgeably, leaning
across Neville toward her (Neville winced, it was very uncomfortable
to have a ghost lean through you). “The hat feels itself honor-bound
to give the school due warning whenever it feels —”
But Professor McGonagall, who was waiting to read out the list of
first years’ names, was giving the whispering students the sort of look
that scorches. Nearly Headless Nick placed a see-through finger to his
lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt
end. With a last frowning look that swept the four House tables, Pro-
fessor McGonagall lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment
and called out,
“Abercrombie, Euan.”
The terrified-looking boy Harry had noticed earlier stumbled

207
CHAPTER ELEVEN
forward and put the hat on his head; it was only prevented from
falling right down to his shoulders by his very prominent ears. The hat
considered for a moment, then the rip near the brim opened again
and shouted, “GRYFFINDOR !”
Harry clapped loudly with the rest of Gryffindor House as Euan
Abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down, looking as though
he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be
looked at again.
Slowly the long line of first years thinned; in the pauses between
the names and the Sorting Hat’s decisions, Harry could hear Ron’s
stomach rumbling loudly. Finally, “Zeller, Rose” was sorted into Huf-
flepuff, and Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and stool and
marched them away as Professor Dumbledore rose to his feet.
Harry was somehow soothed to see Dumbledore standing before
them all, whatever his recent bitter feelings toward his headmaster.
Between the absence of Hagrid and the presence of those dragonish
horses, he had felt that his return to Hogwarts, so long anticipated,
was full of unexpected surprises like jarring notes in a familiar song.
But this, at least, was how it was supposed to be: their headmaster ris-
ing to greet them all before the start-of-term feast.
“To our newcomers,” said Dumbledore in a ringing voice, his arms
stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips, “welcome! To our old
hands — welcome back! There is a time for speech making, but this is
not it. Tuck in!”
There was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as Dum-
bledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as
to keep it out of the way of his plate — for food had appeared out of
nowhere, so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and pies
and dishes of vegetables, bread, sauces, and flagons of pumpkin juice.
“Excellent,” said Ron, with a kind of groan of longing, and he
seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them onto his plate,
watched wistfully by Nearly Headless Nick.


NEW SONG
“What were you saying before the Sorting?” Hermione asked the
ghost. “About the hat giving warnings?”
“Oh yes,” said Nick, who seemed glad of a reason to turn away
from Ron, who was now eating roast potatoes with almost indecent
enthusiasm. “Yes, I have heard the hat give several warnings before,
always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school.
And always, of course, its advice is the same: Stand together, be strong
from within.”
“Ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat?” said Ron.
His mouth was so full Harry thought it was quite an achievement
for him to make any noise at all.
“I beg your pardon?” said Nearly Headless Nick politely, while
Hermione looked revolted. Ron gave an enormous swallow and said,
“How can it know if the school’s in danger if it’s a hat?”
“I have no idea,” said Nearly Headless Nick. “Of course, it lives in
Dumbledore’s office, so I daresay it picks things up there.”
“And it wants all the Houses to be friends?” said Harry, looking
over at the Slytherin table, where Draco Malfoy was holding court.
“Fat chance.”
“Well, now, you shouldn’t take that attitude,” said Nick reprovingly.
“Peaceful cooperation, that’s the key. We ghosts, though we belong to
separate Houses, maintain links of friendship. In spite of the compet-
itiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I would never dream of
seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron.”
“Only because you’re terrified of him,” said Ron.
Nearly Headless Nick looked highly affronted.
“Terrified? I hope I, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, have never
been guilty of cowardice in my life! The noble blood that runs in my
veins —”
“What blood?” asked Ron. “Surely you haven’t still got — ?”
“It’s a figure of speech!” said Nearly Headless Nick, now so annoyed
his head was trembling ominously on his partially severed neck. “I

209
CHAPTER ELEVEN
assume I am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever words I like,
even if the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me! But I am
quite used to students poking fun at my death, I assure you!”
“Nick, he wasn’t really laughing at you!” said Hermione, throwing
a furious look at Ron.
Unfortunately, Ron’s mouth was packed to exploding point again
and all he could manage was “node iddum eentup sechew,” which
Nick did not seem to think constituted an adequate apology. Rising
into the air, he straightened his feathered hat and swept away from
them to the other end of the table, coming to rest between the
Creevey brothers, Colin and Dennis.
“Well done, Ron,” snapped Hermione.
“What?” said Ron indignantly, having managed, finally, to swallow
his food. “I’m not allowed to ask a simple question?”
“Oh forget it,” said Hermione irritably, and the pair of them spent
the rest of the meal in huffy silence.
Harry was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile
them; he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his way steadily
through his steak-and-kidney pie, then a large plateful of his favorite
treacle tart.
When all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the
hall was starting to creep upward again, Dumbledore got to his feet
once more. Talking ceased immediately as all turned to face the head-
master. Harry was feeling pleasantly drowsy now. His four-poster bed
was waiting somewhere above, wonderfully warm and soft. . . .
“Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg
a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices,”
said Dumbledore. “First years ought to know that the forest in the
grounds is out of bounds to students — and a few of our older students
ought to know by now too.” (Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged
smirks.)

“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the
four hundred and sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is
not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other
things, all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened
to Mr. Filch’s office door.
“We have had two changes in staffing this year. We are very pleased
to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of
Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Profes-
sor Umbridge, our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
There was a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic applause dur-
ing which Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged slightly panicked
looks; Dumbledore had not said for how long Grubbly-Plank would
be teaching.
Dumbledore continued, “Tryouts for the House Quidditch teams
will take place on the —”
He broke off, looking inquiringly at Professor Umbridge. As she
was not much taller standing than sitting, there was a moment when
nobody understood why Dumbledore had stopped talking, but then
Professor Umbridge said, “Hem, hem,” and it became clear that she
had got to her feet and was intending to make a speech.
Dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment, then he sat
back down smartly and looked alertly at Professor Umbridge as
though he desired nothing better than to listen to her talk. Other
members of staff were not as adept at hiding their surprise. Professor
Sprout’s eyebrows had disappeared into her flyaway hair, and Profes-
sor McGonagall’s mouth was as thin as Harry had ever seen it. No
new teacher had ever interrupted Dumbledore before. Many of the
students were smirking; this woman obviously did not know how
things were done at Hogwarts.
“Thank you, Headmaster,” Professor Umbridge simpered, “for
those kind words of welcome.”


CHAPTER ELEVEN
Her voice was high-pitched, breathy, and little-girlish and again,
Harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that he could not explain to him-
self; all he knew was that he loathed everything about her, from her
stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan. She gave another little throat-
clearing cough (“Hem, hem”) and continued: “Well, it is lovely to be
back at Hogwarts, I must say!” She smiled, revealing very pointed
teeth. “And to see such happy little faces looking back at me!”
Harry glanced around. None of the faces he could see looked
happy; on the contrary, they all looked rather taken aback at being
addressed as though they were five years old.
“I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all, and
I’m sure we’ll be very good friends!”
Students exchanged looks at this; some of them were barely con-
cealing grins.
“I’ll be her friend as long as I don’t have to borrow that cardigan,”
Parvati whispered to Lavender, and both of them lapsed into silent
giggles.
Professor Umbridge cleared her throat again (“Hem, hem”), but
when she continued, some of the breathiness had vanished from her
voice. She sounded much more businesslike and now her words had a
dull learned-by-heart sound to them.
“The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of
young witches and wizards to be of vital importance. The rare gifts
with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and
honed by careful instruction. The ancient skills unique to the Wiz-
arding community must be passed down through the generations lest
we lose them forever. The treasure trove of magical knowledge
amassed by our ancestors must be guarded, replenished, and polished
by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching.”
Professor Umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her
fellow staff members, none of whom bowed back. Professor McGona-
gall’s dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively

212
THE SORTING HAT’S
NEW SONG
hawklike, and Harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance
with Professor Sprout as Umbridge gave another little “Hem, hem” and
went on with her speech.
“Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought
something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school,
and that is as it should be, for without progress there will be stagnation
and decay. There again, progress for progress’s sake must be discour-
aged, for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering. A
balance, then, between old and new, between permanence and change,
between tradition and innovation . . .”
Harry found his attentiveness ebbing, as though his brain was slip-
ping in and out of tune. The quiet that always filled the Hall when
Dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put their heads
together, whispering and giggling. Over at the Ravenclaw table, Cho
Chang was chatting animatedly with her friends. A few seats along
from Cho, Luna Lovegood had got out The Quibbler again. Mean-
while at the Hufflepuff table, Ernie Macmillan was one of the few still
staring at Professor Umbridge, but he was glassy-eyed and Harry was
sure he was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the
new prefect’s badge gleaming on his chest.
Professor Umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her
audience. Harry had the impression that a full-scale riot could have
broken out under her nose and she would have plowed on with her
speech. The teachers, however, were still listening very attentively, and
Hermione seemed to be drinking in every word Umbridge spoke,
though judging by her expression, they were not at all to her taste.
“. . . because some changes will be for the better, while others will
come, in the fullness of time, to be recognized as errors of judgment.
Meanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas
others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned. Let us move
forward, then, into a new era of openness, effectiveness, and account-
ability, intent on preserving what ought to be preserved, perfecting

213
CHAPTER ELEVEN
what needs to be perfected, and pruning wherever we find practices
that ought to be prohibited.”
She sat down. Dumbledore clapped. The staff followed his lead,
though Harry noticed that several of them brought their hands to-
gether only once or twice before stopping. A few students joined in,
but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech, not hav-
ing listened to more than a few words of it, and before they could start
applauding properly, Dumbledore had stood up again.
“Thank you very much, Professor Umbridge, that was most illumi-
nating,” he said, bowing to her. “Now — as I was saying, Quidditch
tryouts will be held . . .”
“Yes, it certainly was illuminating,” said Hermione in a low voice.
“You’re not telling me you enjoyed it?” Ron said quietly, turning a
glazed face upon Hermione. “That was about the dullest speech I’ve
ever heard, and I grew up with Percy.”
“I said illuminating, not enjoyable,” said Hermione. “It explained
a lot.”
“Did it?” said Harry in surprise. “Sounded like a load of waffle to me.”
“There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle,” said Her-
mione grimly.
“Was there?” said Ron blankly.
“How about ‘progress for progress’s sake must be discouraged’? How
about ‘pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited’?”
“Well, what does that mean?” said Ron impatiently.
“I’ll tell you what it means,” said Hermione ominously. “It means
the Ministry’s interfering at Hogwarts.”
There was a great clattering and banging all around them; Dumb-
ledore had obviously just dismissed the school, because everyone was
standing up ready to leave the Hall. Hermione jumped up, looking
flustered.
“Ron, we’re supposed to show the first years where to go!”

214
THE SORTING HAT’S

“Oh yeah,” said Ron, who had obviously forgotten. “Hey — hey
you lot! Midgets!”
“Ron!”
“Well, they are, they’re titchy. . . .”
“I know, but you can’t call them midgets. . . . First years!” Hermione
called commandingly along the table. “This way, please!”
A group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the
Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables, all of them trying hard not to lead
the group. They did indeed seem very small; Harry was sure he had
not appeared that young when he had arrived here. He grinned at
them. A blond boy next to Euan Abercrombie looked petrified,
nudged Euan, and whispered something in his ear. Euan Abercrombie
looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at Harry, who felt
the grin slide off his face like Stinksap.
“See you later,” he said to Ron and Hermione and he made his way
out of the Great Hall alone, doing everything he could to ignore more
whispering, staring, and pointing as he passed. He kept his eyes fixed
ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the entrance hall, then
he hurried up the marble staircase, took a couple of concealed short-
cuts, and had soon left most of the crowds behind.
He had been stupid not to expect this, he thought angrily, as he
walked through much emptier upstairs corridors. Of course everyone
was staring at him: He had emerged from the Triwizard maze two
months ago clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming
to have seen Lord Voldemort return to power. There had not been
time last term to explain himself before everyone went home, even if
he had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the ter-
rible events in that graveyard.
He had reached the end of the corridor to the Gryffindor common
room and had come to a halt in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady
before he realized that he did not know the new password.

215
CHAPTER ELEVEN
“Er . . .” he said glumly, staring up at the Fat Lady, who smoothed
the folds of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at him.
“No password, no entrance,” she said loftily.
“Harry, I know it!” someone panted from behind him, and he
turned to see Neville jogging toward him. “Guess what it is? I’m actu-
ally going to be able to remember it for once —” He waved the
stunted little cactus he had shown them on the train. “Mimbulus
mimbletonia!”
“Correct,” said the Fat Lady, and her portrait swung open toward
them like a door, revealing a circular hole in the wall behind, through
which Harry and Neville now climbed.
The Gryffindor common room looked as welcoming as ever, a cozy
circular tower room full of dilapidated squashy armchairs and rickety
old tables. A fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people
were warming their hands before going up to their dormitories; on the
other side of the room Fred and George Weasley were pinning some-
thing up on the notice board. Harry waved good night to them and
headed straight for the door to the boys’ dormitories; he was not in
much of a mood for talking at the moment. Neville followed him.
Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan had reached the dormitory
first and were in the process of covering the walls beside their beds
with posters and photographs. They had been talking as Harry
pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw
him. Harry wondered whether they had been talking about him, then
whether he was being paranoid.
“Hi,” he said, moving across to his own trunk and opening it.
“Hey, Harry,” said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pajamas in
the West Ham colors. “Good holiday?”
“Not bad,” muttered Harry, as a true account of his holiday would
have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it. “You?”
“Yeah, it was okay,” chuckled Dean. “Better than Seamus’s anyway,
he was just telling me.”


“Why, what happened, Seamus?” Neville asked as he placed his
Mimbulus mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet.
Seamus did not answer immediately; he was making rather a meal
of ensuring that his poster of the Kenmare Kestrels Quidditch team
was quite straight. Then he said, with his back still turned to Harry,
“Me mam didn’t want me to come back.”
“What?” said Harry, pausing in the act of pulling off his robes.
“She didn’t want me to come back to Hogwarts.”
Seamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pajamas
out of his trunk, still not looking at Harry.
“But — why?” said Harry, astonished. He knew that Seamus’s
mother was a witch and could not understand, therefore, why she
should have come over so Dursley-ish.
Seamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his pajamas.
“Well,” he said in a measured voice, “I suppose . . . because of you.”
“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly. His heart was beating
rather fast. He felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him.
“Well,” said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry’s eyes, “she . . . er
. . . well, it’s not just you, it’s Dumbledore too . . .”
“She believes the Daily Prophet?” said Harry. “She thinks I’m a liar
and Dumbledore’s an old fool?”
Seamus looked up at him. “Yeah, something like that.”
Harry said nothing. He threw his wand down onto his bedside
table, pulled off his robes, stuffed them angrily into his trunk, and
pulled on his pajamas. He was sick of it; sick of being the person who
was stared at and talked about all the time. If any of them knew, if any
of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these
things had happened to . . . Mrs. Finnigan had no idea, the stupid
woman, he thought savagely.
He got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him,
but before he could do so, Seamus said, “Look . . . what did happen
that night when . . . you know, when . . . with Cedric Diggory and all?”

217
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time. Dean, who
had been bending over his trunk, trying to retrieve a slipper, went
oddly still and Harry knew he was listening hard.
“What are you asking me for?” Harry retorted. “Just read the Daily
Prophet like your mother, why don’t you? That’ll tell you all you need
to know.”
“Don’t you have a go at my mother,” snapped Seamus.
“I’ll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar,” said Harry.
“Don’t talk to me like that!”
“I’ll talk to you how I want,” said Harry, his temper rising so fast he
snatched his wand back from his bedside table. “If you’ve got a prob-
lem sharing a dormitory with me, go and ask McGonagall if you can
be moved, stop your mummy worrying —”
“Leave my mother out of this, Potter!”
“What’s going on?”
Ron had appeared in the doorway. His wide eyes traveled from
Harry, who was kneeling on his bed with his wand pointing at Sea-
mus, to Seamus, who was standing there with his fists raised.
“He’s having a go at my mother!” Seamus yelled.
“What?” said Ron. “Harry wouldn’t do that — we met your mother,
we liked her. . . .”
“That’s before she started believing every word the stinking Daily
Prophet writes about me!” said Harry at the top of his voice.
“Oh,” said Ron, comprehension dawning across his freckled face.
“Oh . . . right.”
“You know what?” said Seamus heatedly, casting Harry a venomous
look. “He’s right, I don’t want to share a dormitory with him any-
more, he’s a madman.”
“That’s out of order, Seamus,” said Ron, whose ears were starting to
glow red, always a danger sign.
“Out of order, am I?” shouted Seamus, who in contrast with Ron


was turning paler. “You believe all the rubbish he’s come out with
about You-Know-Who, do you, you reckon he’s telling the truth?”
“Yeah, I do!” said Ron angrily.
“Then you’re mad too,” said Seamus in disgust.
“Yeah? Well unfortunately for you, pal, I’m also a prefect!” said
Ron, jabbing himself in the chest with a finger. “So unless you want
detention, watch your mouth!”
Seamus looked for a few seconds as though detention would be a
reasonable price to pay to say what was going through his mind; but
with a noise of contempt he turned on his heel, vaulted into bed, and
pulled the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped
from the bed and fell in a dusty pile to the floor. Ron glared at Sea-
mus, then looked at Dean and Neville.
“Anyone else’s parents got a problem with Harry?” he said
aggressively.
“My parents are Muggles, mate,” said Dean, shrugging. “They
don’t know nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts, because I’m not
stupid enough to tell them.”
“You don’t know my mother, she’ll weasel anything out of anyone!”
Seamus snapped at him. “Anyway, your parents don’t get the Daily
Prophet, they don’t know our headmaster’s been sacked from the Wiz-
engamot and the International Confederation of Wizards because he’s
losing his marbles —”
“My gran says that’s rubbish,” piped up Neville. “She says it’s the
Daily Prophet that’s going downhill, not Dumbledore. She’s canceled
our subscription. We believe Harry,” he said simply. He climbed into
bed and pulled the covers up to his chin, looking owlishly over them
at Seamus. “My gran’s always said You-Know-Who would come back
one day. She says if Dumbledore says he’s back, he’s back.”
Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Neville. Nobody else said
anything. Seamus got out his wand, repaired the bed hangings, and

219
CHAPTER ELEVEN
vanished behind them. Dean got into bed, rolled over, and fell silent.
Neville, who appeared to have nothing more to say either, was gazing
fondly at his moonlit cactus.
Harry lay back on his pillows while Ron bustled around the next
bed, putting his things away. He felt shaken by the argument with
Seamus, whom he had always liked very much. How many more peo-
ple were going to suggest that he was lying or unhinged?
Had Dumbledore suffered like this all summer, as first the Wizen-
gamot, then the International Confederation of Wizards had thrown
him from their ranks? Was it anger at Harry, perhaps, that had
stopped Dumbledore getting in touch with him for months? The two
of them were in this together, after all; Dumbledore had believed
Harry, announced his version of events to the whole school and then
to the wider Wizarding community. Anyone who thought Harry was
a liar had to think that Dumbledore was too or else that Dumbledore
had been hoodwinked. . . .
They’ll know we’re right in the end, thought Harry miserably, as Ron
got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory. But he
wondered how many attacks like Seamus’s he would have to endure
before that time came.

eamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory
before Harry had even put on his socks.
“Does he think he’ll turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me
too long?” asked Harry loudly, as the hem of Seamus’s robes whipped
out of sight.
“Don’t worry about it, Harry,” Dean muttered, hoisting his school-
bag onto his shoulder. “He’s just . . .” But apparently he was unable to
say exactly what Seamus was, and after a slightly awkward pause fol-
lowed him out of the room.
Neville and Ron both gave Harry it’s-his-problem-not-yours looks,
but Harry was not much consoled. How much more of this was he
going to have to take?
“What’s the matter?” asked Hermione five minutes later, catching
up with Harry and Ron halfway across the common room as they all
headed toward breakfast. “You look absolutely — oh for heaven’s
sake.”
She was staring at the common room notice board, where a large
new sign had been put up.

“They are the limit,” said Hermione grimly, taking down the sign,
which Fred and George had pinned up over a poster giving the date of
the first Hogsmeade weekend in October. “We’ll have to talk to them,
Ron.”
Ron looked positively alarmed.
“Why?”
“Because we’re prefects!” said Hermione, as they climbed out
through the portrait hole. “It’s up to us to stop this kind of thing!”
Ron said nothing; Harry could tell from his glum expression that
the prospect of stopping Fred and George doing exactly what they
liked was not one that he found inviting.
“Anyway, what’s up, Harry?” Hermione continued, as they walked
down a flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wizards,
all of whom ignored them, being engrossed in their own conversation.
“You look really angry about something.”
“Seamus reckons Harry’s lying about You-Know-Who,” said Ron
succinctly, when Harry did not respond.
Hermione, whom Harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf,
sighed.
“Yes, Lavender thinks so too,” she said gloomily.
“Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I’m a
lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?” Harry said loudly.
“No,” said Hermione calmly, “I told her to keep her big fat mouth


shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped
jumping down Ron’s and my throats, Harry, because if you haven’t
noticed, we’re on your side.”
There was a short pause.
“Sorry,” said Harry in a low voice.
“That’s quite all right,” said Hermione with dignity. Then she
shook her head. “Don’t you remember what Dumbledore said at the
end-of-term feast last year?”
Harry and Ron both looked at her blankly, and Hermione sighed
again.
“About You-Know-Who. He said, ‘His gift for spreading discord and
enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong
bond of friendship and trust —’ ”
“How do you remember stuff like that?” asked Ron, looking at her
in admiration.
“I listen, Ron,” said Hermione with a touch of asperity.
“So do I, but I still couldn’t tell you exactly what —”
“The point,” Hermione pressed on loudly, “is that this sort of thing
is exactly what Dumbledore was talking about. You-Know-Who’s
only been back two months, and we’ve started fighting among our-
selves. And the Sorting Hat’s warning was the same — stand together,
be united —”
“And Harry said it last night,” retorted Ron, “if that means we’re
supposed to get matey with the Slytherins, fat chance.”
“Well, I think it’s a pity we’re not trying for a bit of inter-House
unity,” said Hermione crossly.
They had reached the foot of the marble staircase. A line of fourth-
year Ravenclaws was crossing the entrance hall; they caught sight of
Harry and hurried to form a tighter group, as though frightened he
might attack stragglers.
“Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like
that,” said Harry sarcastically.

223
CHAPTER TWELVE
They followed the Ravenclaws into the Great Hall, looking in-
stinctively at the staff table as they entered. Professor Grubbly-Plank
was chatting to Professor Sinistra, the Astronomy teacher, and Hagrid
was once again conspicuous only by his absence. The enchanted ceil-
ing above them echoed Harry’s mood; it was a miserable rain-cloud
gray.
“Dumbledore didn’t even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank
woman’s staying,” he said, as they made their way across to the
Gryffindor table.
“Maybe . . .” said Hermione thoughtfully.
“What?” said both Harry and Ron together.
“Well . . . maybe he didn’t want to draw attention to Hagrid not
being here.”
“What d’you mean, draw attention to it?” said Ron, half laughing.
“How could we not notice?”
Before Hermione could answer, a tall black girl with long, braided
hair had marched up to Harry.
“Hi, Angelina.”
“Hi,” she said briskly, “good summer?” And without waiting for an
answer, “Listen, I’ve been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.”
“Nice one,” said Harry, grinning at her; he suspected Angelina’s
pep talks might not be as long-winded as Oliver Wood’s had been,
which could only be an improvement.
“Yeah, well, we need a new Keeper now Oliver’s left. Tryouts are on
Friday at five o’clock and I want the whole team there, all right? Then
we can see how the new person’ll fit in.”
“Okay,” said Harry, and she smiled at him and departed.
“I’d forgotten Wood had left,” said Hermione vaguely, sitting down
beside Ron and pulling a plate of toast toward her. “I suppose that will
make quite a difference to the team?”
“I s’pose,” said Harry, taking the bench opposite. “He was a good
Keeper. . . .”


PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
“Still, it won’t hurt to have some new blood, will it?” said Ron.
With a whoosh and a clatter, hundreds of owls came soaring in
through the upper windows. They descended all over the Hall, bring-
ing letters and packages to their owners and showering the breakfasters
with droplets of water; it was clearly raining hard outside. Hedwig was
nowhere to be seen, but Harry was hardly surprised; his only corre-
spondent was Sirius, and he doubted Sirius would have anything new
to tell him after only twenty-four hours apart. Hermione, however,
had to move her orange juice aside quickly to make way for a large
damp barn owl bearing a sodden Daily Prophet in its beak.
“What are you still getting that for?” said Harry irritably, thinking
of Seamus, as Hermione placed a Knut in the leather pouch on the
owl’s leg and it took off again. “I’m not bothering . . . load of
rubbish.”
“It’s best to know what the enemy are saying,” said Hermione
darkly, and she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it,
not emerging until Harry and Ron had finished eating.
“Nothing,” she said simply, rolling up the newspaper and laying it
down by her plate. “Nothing about you or Dumbledore or anything.”
Professor McGonagall was now moving along the table handing
out schedules.
“Look at today!” groaned Ron. “History of Magic, double Potions,
Divination, and double Defense Against the Dark Arts . . . Binns,
Snape, Trelawney, and that Umbridge woman all in one day! I wish Fred
and George’d hurry up and get those Skiving Snackboxes sorted. . . .”
“Do mine ears deceive me?” said Fred, arriving with George and
squeezing onto the bench beside Harry. “Hogwarts prefects surely
don’t wish to skive off lessons?”
“Look what we’ve got today,” said Ron grumpily, shoving his
schedule under Fred’s nose. “That’s the worst Monday I’ve ever seen.”
“Fair point, little bro,” said Fred, scanning the column. “You can
have a bit of Nosebleed Nougat cheap if you like.”

225
CHAPTER TWELVE
“Why’s it cheap?” said Ron suspiciously.
“Because you’ll keep bleeding till you shrivel up, we haven’t got an
antidote yet,” said George, helping himself to a kipper.
“Cheers,” said Ron moodily, pocketing his schedule, “but I think
I’ll take the lessons.”
“And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,” said Hermione, eyeing
Fred and George beadily, “you can’t advertise for testers on the
Gryffindor notice board.”
“Says who?” said George, looking astonished.
“Says me,” said Hermione. “And Ron.”
“Leave me out of it,” said Ron hastily.
Hermione glared at him. Fred and George sniggered.
“You’ll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,” said
Fred, thickly buttering a crumpet. “You’re starting your fifth year,
you’ll be begging us for a Snackbox before long.”
“And why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snack-
box?” asked Hermione.
“Fifth year’s O.W.L. year,” said George.
“So?”
“So you’ve got your exams coming up, haven’t you? They’ll be keep-
ing your noses so hard to that grindstone they’ll be rubbed raw,” said
Fred with satisfaction.
“Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to O.W.L.s,” said
George happily. “Tears and tantrums . . . Patricia Stimpson kept com-
ing over faint. . . .”
“Kenneth Towler came out in boils, d’you remember?” said Fred
reminiscently.
“That’s ’cause you put Bulbadox Powder in his pajamas,” said
George.
“Oh yeah,” said Fred, grinning. “I’d forgotten. . . . Hard to keep
track sometimes, isn’t it?”
“Anyway, it’s a nightmare of a year, the fifth,” said George. “If you

226
PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
care about exam results anyway. Fred and I managed to keep our spir-
its up somehow.”
“Yeah . . . you got, what was it, three O.W.L.s each?” said Ron.
“Yep,” said Fred unconcernedly. “But we feel our futures lie outside
the world of academic achievement.”
“We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming
back for our seventh year,” said George brightly, “now that we’ve
got —”
He broke off at a warning look from Harry, who knew George had
been about to mention the Triwizard winnings he had given them.
“— now that we’ve got our O.W.L.s,” George said hastily. “I mean,
do we really need N.E.W.T.s? But we didn’t think Mum could take us
leaving school early, not on top of Percy turning out to be the world’s
biggest prat.”
“We’re not going to waste our last year here, though,” said Fred,
looking affectionately around at the Great Hall. “We’re going to use it
to do a bit of market research, find out exactly what the average Hog-
warts student requires from his joke shop, carefully evaluate the results
of our research, and then produce the products to fit the demand.”
“But where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop?”
asked Hermione skeptically. “You’re going to need all the ingredients
and materials — and premises too, I suppose. . . .”
Harry did not look at the twins. His face felt hot; he deliberately
dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it. He heard Fred say
overhead, “Ask us no questions and we’ll tell you no lies, Hermione.
C’mon, George, if we get there early we might be able to sell a few Ex-
tendable Ears before Herbology.”
Harry emerged from under the table to see Fred and George walk-
ing away, each carrying a stack of toast.
“What did that mean?” said Hermione, looking from Harry to
Ron. “ ‘Ask us no questions . . .’ Does that mean they’ve already got
some gold to start a joke shop?”

227
CHAPTER TWELVE
“You know, I’ve been wondering about that,” said Ron, his brow
furrowed. “They bought me a new set of dress robes this summer, and
I couldn’t understand where they got the Galleons. . . .”
Harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these
dangerous waters.
“D’you reckon it’s true this year’s going to be really tough? Because
of the exams?”
“Oh yeah,” said Ron. “Bound to be, isn’t it? O.W.L.s are really
important, affect the jobs you can apply for and everything. We get
career advice too, later this year, Bill told me. So you can choose what
N.E.W.T.s you want to do next year.”
“D’you know what you want to do after Hogwarts?” Harry asked
the other two, as they left the Great Hall shortly afterward and set off
toward their History of Magic classroom.
“Not really,” said Ron slowly. “Except . . . well . . .”
He looked slightly sheepish.
“What?” Harry urged him.
“Well, it’d be cool to be an Auror,” said Ron in an offhand voice.
“Yeah, it would,” said Harry fervently.
“But they’re, like, the elite,” said Ron. “You’ve got to be really good.
What about you, Hermione?”
“I don’t know,” said Hermione. “I think I’d really like to do some-
thing worthwhile.”
“An Auror’s worthwhile!” said Harry.
“Yes, it is, but it’s not the only worthwhile thing,” said Hermione
thoughtfully. “I mean, if I could take S.P.E.W. further . . .”
Harry and Ron carefully avoided looking at each other.
History of Magic was by common consent the most boring subject
ever devised by Wizard-kind. Professor Binns, their ghost teacher, had
a wheezy, droning voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe
drowsiness within ten minutes, five in warm weather. He never varied
the form of their lessons, but lectured them without pausing while

228
PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
they took notes, or rather, gazed sleepily into space. Harry and Ron
had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying
Hermione’s notes before exams; she alone seemed able to resist the so-
porific power of Binns’s voice.
Today they suffered through three quarters of an hour’s droning on
the subject of giant wars. Harry heard just enough within the first ten
minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher’s hands this
subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain
disengaged, and he spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing
hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione
shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye.
“How would it be,” she asked them coldly as they left the classroom
for break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), “if I refused
to lend you my notes this year?”
“We’d fail our O.W.L.s,” said Ron. “If you want that on your con-
science, Hermione . . .”
“Well, you’d deserve it,” she snapped. “You don’t even try to listen
to him, do you?”
“We do try,” said Ron. “We just haven’t got your brains or your
memory or your concentration — you’re just cleverer than we are —
is it nice to rub it in?”
“Oh, don’t give me that rubbish,” said Hermione, but she looked
slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard.
A fine misty drizzle was falling, so that the people standing in hud-
dles around the yard looked blurred at the edges. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony,
turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air
and talking about what Snape was likely to set them in the first lesson
of the year. They had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be
something extremely difficult, just to catch them off guard after a
two-month holiday, when someone walked around the corner toward
them.

229
CHAPTER TWELVE
“Hello, Harry!”
It was Cho Chang and what was more, she was on her own again.
This was most unusual: Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang
of giggling girls; Harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by
herself to ask her to the Yule Ball.
“Hi,” said Harry, feeling his face grow hot. At least you’re not covered
in Stinksap this time, he told himself. Cho seemed to be thinking along
the same lines.
“You got that stuff off, then?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, trying to grin as though the memory of their
last meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying. “So did you . . . er
. . . have a good summer?”
The moment he had said this he wished he hadn’t: Cedric had been
Cho’s boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her
holiday almost as badly as it had affected Harry’s. . . . Something
seemed to tauten in her face, but she said, “Oh, it was all right, you
know. . . .”
“Is that a Tornados badge?” Ron demanded suddenly, pointing at
the front of Cho’s robes, to which a sky-blue badge emblazoned with
a double gold T was pinned. “You don’t support them, do you?”
“Yeah, I do,” said Cho.
“Have you always supported them, or just since they started win-
ning the league?” said Ron, in what Harry considered an unnecessarily
accusatory tone of voice.
“I’ve supported them since I was six,” said Cho coolly. “Anyway . . .
see you, Harry.”
She walked away. Hermione waited until Cho was halfway across
the courtyard before rounding on Ron.
“You are so tactless!”
“What? I only asked her if —”
“Couldn’t you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own?”

230
PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
“So? She could’ve done, I wasn’t stopping —”
“What on earth were you attacking her about her Quidditch team
for?”
“Attacking? I wasn’t attacking her, I was only —”
“Who cares if she supports the Tornados?”
“Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those badges only
bought them last season —”
“But what does it matter?”
“It means they’re not real fans, they’re just jumping on the
bandwagon —”
“That’s the bell,” said Harry listlessly, because Ron and Hermione
were bickering too loudly to hear it. They did not stop arguing all the
way down to Snape’s dungeon, which gave Harry plenty of time to re-
flect that between Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever to have two
minutes’ conversation with Cho that he could look back on without
wanting to leave the country.
And yet, he thought, as they joined the queue lining up outside
Snape’s classroom door, she had chosen to come and talk to him, hadn’t
she? She had been Cedric’s girlfriend; she could easily have hated Harry
for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when Cedric had died, yet
she was talking to him in a perfectly friendly way, not as though she
thought him mad, or a liar, or in some horrible way responsible for
Cedric’s death. . . . Yes, she had definitely chosen to come and talk to
him, and that made the second time in two days . . . and at this
thought, Harry’s spirits rose. Even the ominous sound of Snape’s dun-
geon door creaking open did not puncture the small, hopeful bubble
that seemed to have swelled in his chest. He filed into the classroom be-
hind Ron and Hermione and followed them to their usual table at the
back, ignoring the huffy, irritable noises now issuing from both of them.
“Settle down,” said Snape coldly, shutting the door behind him.
There was no real need for the call to order; the moment the class

231
CHAPTER TWELVE
had heard the door close, quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped.
Snape’s mere presence was usually enough to ensure a class’s silence.
“Before we begin today’s lesson,” said Snape, sweeping over to his
desk and staring around at them all, “I think it appropriate to remind
you that next June you will be sitting an important examination, dur-
ing which you will prove how much you have learned about the
composition and use of magical potions. Moronic though some of
this class undoubtedly are, I expect you to scrape an ‘Acceptable’ in
your O.W.L., or suffer my . . . displeasure.”
His gaze lingered this time upon Neville, who gulped.
“After this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with
me,” Snape went on. “I take only the very best into my N.E.W.T.
Potions class, which means that some of us will certainly be saying
good-bye.”
His eyes rested on Harry and his lip curled. Harry glared back, feel-
ing a grim pleasure at the idea that he would be able to give up Potions
after fifth year.
“But we have another year to go before that happy moment of
farewell,” said Snape softly, “so whether you are intending to attempt
N.E.W.T. or not, I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon
maintaining the high-pass level I have come to expect from my
O.W.L. students.
“Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary
Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and
soothe agitation. Be warned: If you are too heavy-handed with the
ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irre-
versible sleep, so you will need to pay close attention to what you are
doing.” On Harry’s left, Hermione sat up a little straighter, her expres-
sion one of the utmost attentiveness. “The ingredients and method”
— Snape flicked his wand — “are on the blackboard” — (they ap-
peared there) — “you will find everything you need” — he flicked his

232
PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
wand again — “in the store cupboard” — (the door of the said cup-
board sprang open) — “you have an hour and a half. . . . Start.”
Just as Harry, Ron, and Hermione had predicted, Snape could
hardly have set them a more difficult, fiddly potion. The ingredients
had to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quan-
tities; the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times,
firstly in clockwise, then in counterclockwise directions; the heat of
the flames on which it was simmering had to be lowered to exactly the
right level for a specific number of minutes before the final ingredient
was added.
“A light silver vapor should now be rising from your potion,” called
Snape, with ten minutes left to go.
Harry, who was sweating profusely, looked desperately around the
dungeon. His own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark gray
steam; Ron’s was spitting green sparks. Seamus was feverishly prod-
ding the flames at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand, as
they had gone out. The surface of Hermione’s potion, however, was a
shimmering mist of silver vapor, and as Snape swept by he looked
down his hooked nose at it without comment, which meant that he
could find nothing to criticize. At Harry’s cauldron, however, Snape
stopped, looking down at Harry with a horrible smirk on his face.
“Potter, what is this supposed to be?”
The Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly; they
loved hearing Snape taunt Harry.
“The Draught of Peace,” said Harry tensely.
“Tell me, Potter,” said Snape softly, “can you read?”
Draco Malfoy laughed.
“Yes, I can,” said Harry, his fingers clenched tightly around his
wand.
“Read the third line of the instructions for me, Potter.”
Harry squinted at the blackboard; it was not easy to make out the

233
CHAPTER TWELVE
instructions through the haze of multicolored steam now filling the
dungeon.
“ ‘Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counterclockwise, al-
low to simmer for seven minutes, then add two drops of syrup of
hellebore.’ ”
His heart sank. He had not added syrup of hellebore, but had pro-
ceeded straight to the fourth line of the instructions after allowing his
potion to simmer for seven minutes.
“Did you do everything on the third line, Potter?”
“No,” said Harry very quietly.
“I beg your pardon?”
“No,” said Harry, more loudly. “I forgot the hellebore. . . .”
“I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly
worthless. Evanesco.”
The contents of Harry’s potion vanished; he was left standing fool-
ishly beside an empty cauldron.
“Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one
flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name,
and bring it up to my desk for testing,” said Snape. “Homework:
twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its
uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.”
While everyone around him filled their flagons, Harry cleared away
his things, seething. His potion had been no worse than Ron’s, which
was now giving off a foul odor of bad eggs, or Neville’s, which had
achieved the consistency of just-mixed cement and which Neville was
now having to gouge out of his cauldron, yet it was he, Harry, who
would be receiving zero marks for the day’s work. He stuffed his wand
back into his bag and slumped down onto his seat, watching everyone
else march up to Snape’s desk with filled and corked flagons. When at
long last the bell rang, Harry was first out of the dungeon and had al-
ready started his lunch by the time Ron and Hermione joined him in

234
PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
the Great Hall. The ceiling had turned an even murkier gray during
the morning. Rain was lashing the high windows.
“That was really unfair,” said Hermione consolingly, sitting down
next to Harry and helping herself to shepherd’s pie. “Your potion
wasn’t nearly as bad as Goyle’s, when he put it in his flagon the whole
thing shattered and set his robes on fire.”
“Yeah, well,” said Harry, glowering at his plate, “since when has
Snape ever been fair to me?”
Neither of the others answered; all three of them knew that Snape
and Harry’s mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment
Harry had set foot in Hogwarts.
“I did think he might be a bit better this year,” said Hermione in a
disappointed voice. “I mean . . . you know . . .” She looked carefully
around; there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and
nobody was passing the table. “. . . Now he’s in the Order and
everything.”
“Poisonous toadstools don’t change their spots,” said Ron sagely.
“Anyway, I’ve always thought Dumbledore was cracked trusting
Snape, where’s the evidence he ever really stopped working for You-
Know-Who?”
“I think Dumbledore’s probably got plenty of evidence, even if he
doesn’t share it with you, Ron,” snapped Hermione.
“Oh, shut up, the pair of you,” said Harry heavily, as Ron opened
his mouth to argue back. Hermione and Ron both froze, looking an-
gry and offended. “Can’t you give it a rest?” he said. “You’re always
having a go at each other, it’s driving me mad.” And abandoning his
shepherd’s pie, he swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left
them sitting there.
He walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time, past the
many students hurrying toward lunch. The anger that had just flared
so unexpectedly still blazed inside him, and the vision of Ron and

235
CHAPTER TWELVE
Hermione’s shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction.
Serve them right, he thought. Why can’t they give it a rest? . . . Bickering
all the time . . . It’s enough to drive anyone up the wall. . . .
He passed the large picture of Sir Cadogan the knight on a landing;
Sir Cadogan drew his sword and brandished it fiercely at Harry, who
ignored him.
“Come back, you scurvy dog, stand fast and fight!” yelled Sir Cado-
gan in a muffled voice from behind his visor, but Harry merely walked
on, and when Sir Cadogan attempted to follow him by running into
a neighboring picture, he was rebuffed by its inhabitant, a large and
angry-looking wolfhound.
Harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the
trapdoor at the top of North Tower, and consequently he was the first
to ascend the silver ladder that led to Sibyll Trelawney’s classroom
when the bell rang.
Divination was Harry’s least favorite class after Potions, which was
due mainly to Professor Trelawney’s habit of predicting his premature
death every few lessons. A thin woman, heavily draped in shawls and
glittering with strings of beads, she always reminded Harry of some
kind of insect, with her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes. She was
busy putting copies of battered, leather-bound books on each of the
spindly little tables with which her room was littered when Harry en-
tered the room, but so dim was the light cast by the lamps covered by
scarves and the low-burning, sickly-scented fire that she appeared not
to notice him as he took a seat in the shadows. The rest of the class ar-
rived over the next five minutes. Ron emerged from the trapdoor,
looked around carefully, spotted Harry and made directly for him, or
as directly as he could while having to wend his way between tables,
chairs, and overstuffed poufs.
“Hermione and me have stopped arguing,” he said, sitting down
beside Harry.
“Good,” grunted Harry.


“But Hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you stopped tak-
ing out your temper on us,” said Ron.
“I’m not —”
“I’m just passing on the message,” said Ron, talking over him. “But
I reckon she’s right. It’s not our fault how Seamus and Snape treat
you.”
“I never said it —”
“Good day,” said Professor Trelawney in her usual misty, dreamy
voice, and Harry broke off, feeling both annoyed and slightly
ashamed of himself again. “And welcome back to Divination. I have,
of course, been following your fortunes most carefully over the holi-
days, and am delighted to see that you have all returned to Hogwarts
safely — as, of course, I knew you would.
“You will find on the tables before you copies of The Dream Oracle,
by Inigo Imago. Dream interpretation is a most important means of di-
vining the future and one that may very probably be tested in your
O.W.L. Not, of course, that I believe examination passes or failures are
of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of div-
ination. If you have the Seeing Eye, certificates and grades matter very
little. However, the headmaster likes you to sit the examination, so . . .”
Her voice trailed away delicately, leaving them all in no doubt that
Professor Trelawney considered her subject above such sordid matters
as examinations.
“Turn, please, to the introduction and read what Imago has to say
on the matter of dream interpretation. Then divide into pairs. Use
The Dream Oracle to interpret each other’s most recent dreams. Carry
on.
The one good thing to be said for this lesson was that it was not a
double period. By the time they had all finished reading the introduc-
tion of the book, they had barely ten minutes left for dream interpre-
tation. At the table next to Harry and Ron, Dean had paired up with
Neville, who immediately embarked on a long-winded explanation of

a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his grand-
mother’s best hat; Harry and Ron merely looked at each other glumly.
“I never remember my dreams,” said Ron. “You say one.”
“You must remember one of them,” said Harry impatiently.
He was not going to share his dreams with anyone. He knew per-
fectly well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant, he did
not need Ron or Professor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to
tell him that. . . .
“Well, I had one that I was playing Quidditch the other night,”
said Ron, screwing up his face in an effort to remember. “What d’you
reckon that means?”
“Probably that you’re going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or
something,” said Harry, turning the pages of The Dream Oracle with-
out interest.
It was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the Oracle and
Harry was not cheered up when Professor Trelawney set them the task
of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework. When the bell
went, he and Ron led the way back down the ladder, Ron grumbling
loudly.
“D’you realize how much homework we’ve got already? Binns set
us a foot-and-a-half-long essay on giant wars, Snape wants a foot on
the use of moonstones, and now we’ve got a month’s dream diary from
Trelawney! Fred and George weren’t wrong about O.W.L. year, were
they? That Umbridge woman had better not give us any. . . .”
When they entered the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom
they found Professor Umbridge already seated at the teacher’s desk,
wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black vel-
vet bow on top of her head. Harry was again reminded forcibly of a
large fly perched unwisely on top of an even larger toad.
The class was quiet as it entered the room; Professor Umbridge
was, as yet, an unknown quantity and nobody knew yet how strict a
disciplinarian she was likely to be.

“Well, good afternoon!” she said when finally the whole class had
sat down.
A few people mumbled “Good afternoon,” in reply.
“Tut, tut,” said Professor Umbridge. “That won’t do, now, will it? I
should like you, please, to reply ‘Good afternoon, Professor Um-
bridge.’ One more time, please. Good afternoon, class!”
“Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,” they chanted back at her.
“There, now,” said Professor Umbridge sweetly. “That wasn’t too
difficult, was it? Wands away and quills out, please.”
Many of the class exchanged gloomy looks; the order “wands away”
had never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting.
Harry shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled out quill, ink,
and parchment. Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted
her own wand, which was an unusually short one, and tapped the
blackboard sharply with it; words appeared on the board at once:
Defense Against the Dark Arts
A Return to Basic Principles.
“Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted
and fragmented, hasn’t it?” stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face
the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her. “The constant
changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed
any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in
your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your
O.W.L. year.
“You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now
to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory-
centered, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year.
Copy down the following, please.”
She rapped the blackboard again; the first message vanished and
was replaced by:

239
CHAPTER TWELVE
Course aims:
1. Understanding the principles underlying defensive magic.
2. Learning to recognize situations in which defensive magic
can legally be used.
3. Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for
practical use.
For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratch-
ing quills on parchment. When everyone had copied down Professor
Umbridge’s three course aims she said, “Has everybody got a copy of
Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?”
There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class.
“I think we’ll try that again,” said Professor Umbridge. “When I
ask you a question, I should like you to reply ‘Yes, Professor Um-
bridge,’ or ‘No, Professor Umbridge.’ So, has everyone got a copy of
Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?”
“Yes, Professor Umbridge,” rang through the room.
“Good,” said Professor Umbridge. “I should like you to turn to
page five and read chapter one, ‘Basics for Beginners.’ There will be
no need to talk.”
Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the
chair behind the teacher’s desk, observing them all with those pouchy
toad’s eyes. Harry turned to page five of his copy of Defensive Magical
Theory and started to read.
It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns.
He felt his concentration sliding away from him; he had soon read the
same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few
words. Several silent minutes passed. Next to him, Ron was absent-
mindedly turning his quill over and over in his fingers, staring at the
same spot on the page. Harry looked right and received a surprise to
shake him out of his torpor. Hermione had not even opened her copy

240
PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
of Defensive Magical Theory. She was staring fixedly at Professor Um-
bridge with her hand in the air.
Harry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when
instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book
that came under her nose. He looked at her questioningly, but she
merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to
answer questions, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who
was looking just as resolutely in another direction.
After several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the
only one watching Hermione. The chapter they had been instructed
to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to
watch Hermione’s mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge’s eye
than to struggle on with “Basics for Beginners.”
When more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather
than at their books, Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she
could ignore the situation no longer.
“Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?” she
asked Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her.
“Not about the chapter, no,” said Hermione.
“Well, we’re reading just now,” said Professor Umbridge, showing
her small, pointed teeth. “If you have other queries we can deal with
them at the end of class.”
“I’ve got a query about your course aims,” said Hermione.
Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows.
“And your name is — ?”
“Hermione Granger,” said Hermione.
“Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if
you read them through carefully,” said Professor Umbridge in a voice
of determined sweetness.
“Well, I don’t,” said Hermione bluntly. “There’s nothing written
up there about using defensive spells.”

241
CHAPTER TWELVE
There was a short silence in which many members of the class
turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on
the blackboard.
“Using defensive spells?” Professor Umbridge repeated with a little
laugh. “Why, I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom
that would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You
surely aren’t expecting to be attacked during class?”
“We’re not going to use magic?” Ron ejaculated loudly.
“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class,
Mr. — ?”
“Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.
Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on
him. Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Pro-
fessor Umbridge’s pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before
she addressed Hermione.
“Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?”
“Yes,” said Hermione. “Surely the whole point of Defense Against
the Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?”
“Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?”
asked Professor Umbridge in her falsely sweet voice.
“No, but —”
“Well then, I’m afraid you are not qualified to decide what the
‘whole point’ of any class is. Wizards much older and cleverer than
you have devised our new program of study. You will be learning
about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way —”
“What use is that?” said Harry loudly. “If we’re going to be attacked
it won’t be in a —”
“Hand, Mr. Potter!” sang Professor Umbridge.
Harry thrust his fist in the air. Professor Umbridge promptly
turned away from him again, but now several other people had their
hands up too.
“And your name is?” Professor Umbridge said to Dean.

242
PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
“Dean Thomas.”
“Well, Mr. Thomas?”
“Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it?” said Dean. “If we’re going to be
attacked, it won’t be risk-free —”
“I repeat,” said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very irritating
fashion at Dean, “do you expect to be attacked during my classes?”
“No, but —”
Professor Umbridge talked over him.
“I do not wish to criticize the way things have been run in this
school,” she said, an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth,
“but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this
class, very irresponsible indeed — not to mention,” she gave a nasty
little laugh, “extremely dangerous half-breeds.”
“If you mean Professor Lupin,” piped up Dean Thomas angrily,
“he was the best we ever —”
“Hand, Mr. Thomas! As I was saying — you have been introduced
to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group, and
potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you are
likely to meet Dark attacks every other day —”
“No we haven’t,” Hermione said, “we just —”
“Your hand is not up, Miss Granger!”
Hermione put up her hand; Professor Umbridge turned away from
her.
“It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed il-
legal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you —”
“Well, he turned out to be a maniac, didn’t he?” said Dean Thomas
hotly. “Mind you, we still learned loads —”
“Your hand is not up, Mr. Thomas!” trilled Professor Umbridge.
“Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will
be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which,
after all, is what school is all about. And your name is?” she added,
staring at Parvati, whose hand had just shot up.

243
CHAPTER TWELVE
“Parvati Patil, and isn’t there a practical bit in our Defense Against
the Dark Arts O.W.L.? Aren’t we supposed to show that we can actu-
ally do the countercurses and things?”
“As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no
reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under care-
fully controlled examination conditions,” said Professor Umbridge
dismissively.
“Without ever practicing them before?” said Parvati incredulously.
“Are you telling us that the first time we’ll get to do the spells will be
during our exam?”
“I repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard enough —”
“And what good’s theory going to be in the real world?” said Harry
loudly, his fist in the air again.
Professor Umbridge looked up.
“This is school, Mr. Potter, not the real world,” she said softly.
“So we’re not supposed to be prepared for what’s waiting out
there?”
“There is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter.”
“Oh yeah?” said Harry. His temper, which seemed to have been
bubbling just beneath the surface all day, was reaching boiling point.
“Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves?”
inquired Professor Umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice.
“Hmm, let’s think . . .” said Harry in a mock thoughtful voice,
“maybe Lord Voldemort?”
Ron gasped; Lavender Brown uttered a little scream; Neville
slipped sideways off his stool. Professor Umbridge, however, did not
flinch. She was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on
her face.
“Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.”
The classroom was silent and still. Everyone was staring at either
Umbridge or Harry.
“Now, let me make a few things quite plain.”

244
PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned toward them, her stubby-
fingered hands splayed on her desk.
“You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from
the dead —”
“He wasn’t dead,” said Harry angrily, “but yeah, he’s returned!”
“Mr.-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-House-ten-points-do-not-
make-matters-worse-for-yourself,” said Professor Umbridge in one
breath without looking at him. “As I was saying, you have been in-
formed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie.”
“It is NOT a lie!” said Harry. “I saw him, I fought him!”
“Detention, Mr. Potter!” said Professor Umbridge triumphantly.
“Tomorrow evening. Five o’clock. My office. I repeat, this is a lie. The
Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any
Dark wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and see me
outside class hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn
Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it. I am here to help. I am
your friend. And now, you will kindly continue your reading. Page
five, ‘Basics for Beginners.’ ”
Professor Umbridge sat down behind her desk again. Harry, how-
ever, stood up. Everyone was staring at him; Seamus looked half-
scared, half-fascinated.
“Harry, no!” Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at
his sleeve, but Harry jerked his arm out of her reach.
“So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own
accord, did he?” Harry asked, his voice shaking.
There was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of
them, apart from Ron and Hermione, had ever heard Harry talk
about what had happened on the night that Cedric had died. They
stared avidly from Harry to Professor Umbridge, who had raised her
eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face.
“Cedric Diggory’s death was a tragic accident,” she said coldly.
“It was murder,” said Harry. He could feel himself shaking. He had

245
CHAPTER TWELVE
hardly talked to anyone about this, least of all thirty eagerly listening
classmates. “Voldemort killed him, and you know it.”
Professor Umbridge’s face was quite blank. For a moment he
thought she was going to scream at him. Then she said, in her softest,
most sweetly girlish voice, “Come here, Mr. Potter, dear.”
He kicked his chair aside, strode around Ron and Hermione and
up to the teacher’s desk. He could feel the rest of the class holding its
breath. He felt so angry he did not care what happened next.
Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of
her handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped her quill into a bot-
tle of ink, and started scribbling, hunched over so that Harry could
not see what she was writing. Nobody spoke. After a minute or so she
rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand; it sealed itself
seamlessly so that he could not open it.
“Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear,” said Professor Um-
bridge, holding out the note to him.
He took it from her without saying a word and left the room, not
even looking back at Ron and Hermione, and slamming the class-
room door shut behind him. He walked very fast along the corridor,
the note to McGonagall clutched tight in his hand, and turning a cor-
ner walked slap into Peeves the Poltergeist, a wide-faced little man
floating on his back in midair, juggling several inkwells.
“Why, it’s Potty Wee Potter!” cackled Peeves, allowing two of the
inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the
walls with ink; Harry jumped backward out of the way with a snarl.
“Get out of it, Peeves.”
“Oooh, Crackpot’s feeling cranky,” said Peeves, pursuing Harry
along the corridor, leering as he zoomed along above him. “What is it
this time, my fine Potty friend? Hearing voices? Seeing visions? Speak-
ing in” — Peeves blew a gigantic raspberry — “tongues?”
“I said, leave me ALONE!” Harry shouted, running down the

246
PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
nearest flight of stairs, but Peeves merely slid down the banister on his
back beside him.
“Oh, most think he’s barking, the Potty wee lad,
But some are more kindly and think he’s just sad,
But Peevesy knows better and says that he’s mad —”
“SHUT UP!”
A door to his left flew open and Professor McGonagall emerged
from her office looking grim and slightly harassed.
“What on earth are you shouting about, Potter?” she snapped, as
Peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight. “Why aren’t you in
class?”
“I’ve been sent to see you,” said Harry stiffly.
“Sent? What do you mean, sent?”
He held out the note from Professor Umbridge. Professor McGo-
nagall took it from him, frowning, slit it open with a tap of her wand,
stretched it out, and began to read. Her eyes zoomed from side to side
behind their square spectacles as she read what Umbridge had written,
and with each line they became narrower.
“Come in here, Potter.”
He followed her inside her study. The door closed automatically
behind him.
“Well?” said Professor McGonagall, rounding on him. “Is this
true?”
“Is what true?” Harry asked, rather more aggressively than he had
intended. “Professor?” he added in an attempt to sound more polite.
“Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?”
“Yes,” said Harry.
“You called her a liar?”
“Yes.”

247
CHAPTER TWELVE
“You told her He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?”
“Yes.”
Professor McGonagall sat down behind her desk, frowning at Harry.
Then she said, “Have a biscuit, Potter.”
“Have — what?”
“Have a biscuit,” she repeated impatiently, indicating a tartan tin of
cookies lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her desk. “And sit
down.”
There had been a previous occasion when Harry, expecting to be
caned by Professor McGonagall, had instead been appointed by her to
the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He sank into a chair opposite her and
helped himself to a Ginger Newt, feeling just as confused and wrong-
footed as he had done on that occasion.
Professor McGonagall set down Professor Umbridge’s note and
looked very seriously at Harry.
“Potter, you need to be careful.”
Harry swallowed his mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at her.
Her tone of voice was not at all what he was used to; it was not brisk,
crisp, and stern; it was low and anxious and somehow much more hu-
man than usual.
“Misbehavior in Dolores Umbridge’s class could cost you much
more than House points and a detention.”
“What do you — ?”
“Potter, use your common sense,” snapped Professor McGonagall,
with an abrupt return to her usual manner. “You know where she
comes from, you must know to whom she is reporting.”
The bell rang for the end of the lesson. Overhead and all around
came the elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move.
“It says here she’s given you detention every evening this week,
starting tomorrow,” Professor McGonagall said, looking down at Um-
bridge’s note again.

248
PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
“Every evening this week!” Harry repeated, horrified. “But, Profes-
sor, couldn’t you — ?”
“No, I couldn’t,” said Professor McGonagall flatly.
“But —”
“She is your teacher and has every right to give you detention. You
will go to her room at five o’clock tomorrow for the first one. Just re-
member: Tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge.”
“But I was telling the truth!” said Harry, outraged. “Voldemort’s
back, you know he is, Professor Dumbledore knows he is —”
“For heaven’s sake, Potter!” said Professor McGonagall, straighten-
ing her glasses angrily (she had winced horribly when he had used
Voldemort’s name). “Do you really think this is about truth or lies? It’s
about keeping your head down and your temper under control!”
She stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and he stood too.
“Have another biscuit,” she said irritably, thrusting the tin at him.
“No, thanks,” said Harry coldly.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” she snapped.
He took one.
“Thanks,” he said grudgingly.
“Didn’t you listen to Dolores Umbridge’s speech at the start-of-
term feast, Potter?”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah . . . she said . . . progress will be prohib-
ited or . . . well, it meant that . . . that the Ministry of Magic is trying
to interfere at Hogwarts.”
Professor McGonagall eyed him for a moment, then sniffed,
walked around her desk, and held open the door for him.
“Well, I’m glad you listen to Hermione Granger at any rate,” she
said, pointing him out of her office.

inner in the Great Hall that night was not a pleasant experi-
ence for Harry. The news about his shouting match with
Umbridge seemed to have traveled exceptionally fast even by Hog-
warts standards. He heard whispers all around him as he sat eating
between Ron and Hermione. The funny thing was that none of the
whisperers seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying
about him — on the contrary, it was as though they were hoping he
would get angry and start shouting again, so that they could hear his
story firsthand.
“He says he saw Cedric Diggory murdered. . . .”
“He reckons he dueled with You-Know-Who. . . .”
“Come off it. . . .”
“Who does he think he’s kidding?”
“Pur-lease . . .”
“What I don’t get,” said Harry in a shaking voice, laying down his
knife and fork (his hands were trembling too much to hold them
steady), “is why they all believed the story two months ago when
Dumbledore told them. . . .”


“The thing is, Harry, I’m not sure they did,” said Hermione
grimly. “Oh, let’s get out of here.”
She slammed down her own knife and fork; Ron looked sadly at his
half-finished apple pie but followed suit. People stared at them all the
way out of the Hall.
“What d’you mean, you’re not sure they believed Dumbledore?”
Harry asked Hermione when they reached the first-floor landing.
“Look, you don’t understand what it was like after it happened,”
said Hermione quietly. “You arrived back in the middle of the lawn
clutching Cedric’s dead body. . . . None of us saw what happened in
the maze. . . . We just had Dumbledore’s word for it that You-Know-
Who had come back and killed Cedric and fought you.”
“Which is the truth!” said Harry loudly.
“I know it is, Harry, so will you please stop biting my head off?”
said Hermione wearily. “It’s just that before the truth could sink in,
everyone went home for the summer, where they spent two months
reading about how you’re a nutcase and Dumbledore’s going senile!”
Rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty
corridors back to Gryffindor Tower. Harry felt as though his first day
had lasted a week, but he still had a mountain of homework to do be-
fore bed. A dull pounding pain was developing over his right eye. He
glanced out of a rain-washed window at the dark grounds as they turned
into the Fat Lady’s corridor. There was still no light in Hagrid’s cabin.
“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” said Hermione, before the Fat Lady
could ask. The portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind and the
three of them scrambled back through it.
The common room was almost empty; nearly everyone was still
down at dinner. Crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and
trotted to meet them, purring loudly, and when Harry, Ron, and
Hermione took their three favorite chairs at the fireside he leapt
lightly into Hermione’s lap and curled up there like a furry ginger
cushion. Harry gazed into the flames, feeling drained and exhausted.

251
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“How can Dumbledore have let this happen?” Hermione cried sud-
denly, making Harry and Ron jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, look-
ing affronted. She pounded the arms of her chair in fury, so that bits
of stuffing leaked out of the holes. “How can he let that terrible
woman teach us? And in our O.W.L. year too!”
“Well, we’ve never had great Defense Against the Dark Arts teach-
ers, have we?” said Harry. “You know what it’s like, Hagrid told us,
nobody wants the job, they say it’s jinxed.”
“Yes, but to employ someone who’s actually refusing to let us do
magic! What’s Dumbledore playing at?”
“And she’s trying to get people to spy for her,” said Ron darkly. “Re-
member when she said she wanted us to come and tell her if we hear
anyone saying You-Know-Who’s back?”
“Of course she’s here to spy on us all, that’s obvious, why else would
Fudge have wanted her to come?” snapped Hermione.
“Don’t start arguing again,” said Harry wearily, as Ron opened his
mouth to retaliate. “Can’t we just . . . Let’s just do that homework, get
it out of the way. . . .”
They collected their schoolbags from a corner and returned to the
chairs by the fire. People were coming back from dinner now. Harry
kept his face averted from the portrait hole, but could still sense the
stares he was attracting.
“Shall we do Snape’s stuff first?” said Ron, dipping his quill into
his ink. “ ‘The properties . . . of moonstone . . . and its uses . . . in potion-
making . . .’ ” he muttered, writing the words across the top of his
parchment as he spoke them. “There.” He underlined the title, then
looked up expectantly at Hermione.
“So what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-
making?”
But Hermione was not listening; she was squinting over into the far
corner of the room, where Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were now sit-
ting at the center of a knot of innocent-looking first years, all of whom

252
DETENTION WITH
DOLORES
were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large pa-
per bag that Fred was holding.
“No, I’m sorry, they’ve gone too far,” she said, standing up and
looking positively furious. “Come on, Ron.”
“I — what?” said Ron, plainly playing for time. “No — come on,
Hermione — we can’t tell them off for giving out sweets. . . .”
“You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat
or — or Puking Pastilles or —”
“Fainting Fancies?” Harry suggested quietly.
One by one, as though hit over the heads with invisible mallets, the
first years were slumping unconscious in their seats; some slid right
onto the floor, others merely hung over the arms of their chairs, their
tongues lolling out. Most of the people watching were laughing; Her-
mione, however, squared her shoulders and marched directly over to
where Fred and George now stood with clipboards, closely observing
the unconscious first years. Ron rose halfway out of his chair, hovered
uncertainly for a moment or two, then muttered to Harry, “She’s got
it under control,” before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame
permitted.
“That’s enough!” Hermione said forcefully to Fred and George,
both of whom looked up in mild surprise.
“Yeah, you’re right,” said George, nodding, “this dosage looks
strong enough, doesn’t it?”
“I told you this morning, you can’t test your rubbish on students!”
“We’re paying them!” said Fred indignantly.
“I don’t care, it could be dangerous!”
“Rubbish,” said Fred.
“Calm down, Hermione, they’re fine!” said Lee reassuringly as he
walked from first year to first year, inserting purple sweets into their
open mouths.
“Yeah, look, they’re coming round now,” said George.
A few of the first years were indeed stirring. Several looked so

253
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
shocked to find themselves lying on the floor, or dangling off their
chairs, that Harry was sure Fred and George had not warned them
what the sweets were going to do.
“Feel all right?” said George kindly to a small dark-haired girl lying
at his feet.
“I-I think so,” she said shakily.
“Excellent,” said Fred happily, but the next second Hermione had
snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of Fainting Fancies
from his hands.
“It is NOT excellent!”
“ ’Course it is, they’re alive, aren’t they?” said Fred angrily.
“You can’t do this, what if you made one of them really ill?”
“We’re not going to make them ill, we’ve already tested them all on
ourselves, this is just to see if everyone reacts the same —”
“If you don’t stop doing it, I’m going to —”
“Put us in detention?” said Fred in an I’d-like-to-see-you-try-it voice.
“Make us write lines?” said George, smirking.
Onlookers all over the room were laughing. Hermione drew herself
up to her full height; her eyes were narrowed and her bushy hair
seemed to crackle with electricity.
“No,” she said, her voice quivering with anger, “but I will write to
your mother.”
“You wouldn’t,” said George, horrified, taking a step back from her.
“Oh, yes, I would,” said Hermione grimly. “I can’t stop you eating
the stupid things yourselves, but you’re not giving them to first years.”
Fred and George looked thunderstruck. It was clear that as far as
they were concerned, Hermione’s threat was way below the belt. With
a last threatening look at them, she thrust Fred’s clipboard and the bag
of Fancies back into his arms and stalked back to her chair by the fire.
Ron was now so low in his seat that his nose was roughly level with
his knees.

“Thank you for your support, Ron,” Hermione said acidly.
“You handled it fine by yourself,” Ron mumbled.
Hermione stared down at her blank piece of parchment for a few
seconds, then said edgily, “Oh, it’s no good, I can’t concentrate now.
I’m going to bed.”
She wrenched her bag open; Harry thought she was about to put
her books away, but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly ob-
jects, placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace, covered them
with a few screwed-up bits of parchment and a broken quill, and
stood back to admire the effect.
“What in the name of Merlin are you doing?” said Ron, watching
her as though fearful for her sanity.
“They’re hats for house-elves,” she said briskly, now stuffing her
books back into her bag. “I did them over the summer. I’m a really
slow knitter without magic, but now I’m back at school I should be
able to make lots more.”
“You’re leaving out hats for the house-elves?” said Ron slowly. “And
you’re covering them up with rubbish first?”
“Yes,” said Hermione defiantly, swinging her bag onto her back.
“That’s not on,” said Ron angrily. “You’re trying to trick them into
picking up the hats. You’re setting them free when they might not
want to be free.”
“Of course they want to be free!” said Hermione at once, though
her face was turning pink. “Don’t you dare touch those hats, Ron!”
She left. Ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to
the girls’ dormitories, then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats.
“They should at least see what they’re picking up,” he said firmly.
“Anyway . . .” He rolled up the parchment on which he had written
the title of Snape’s essay. “There’s no point trying to finish this now, I
can’t do it without Hermione, I haven’t got a clue what you’re sup-
posed to do with moonstones, have you?”

Harry shook his head, noticing as he did so that the ache in his
right temple was getting worse. He thought of the long essay on giant
wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply. Knowing perfectly well that
he would regret not finishing his homework tonight when the morn-
ing came, he piled his books back into his bag.
“I’m going to bed too.”
He passed Seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormi-
tories, but did not look at him. Harry had a fleeting impression that
Seamus had opened his mouth to speak, but sped up, and reached the
soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure
any more provocation.
The following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous
one. Hagrid was still absent from the staff table at breakfast.
“But on the plus side, no Snape today,” said Ron bracingly.
Hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee. She
looked mildly pleased about something, and when Ron asked her
what she had to be so happy about, she simply said, “The hats have
gone. Seems the house-elves do want freedom after all.”
“I wouldn’t bet on it,” Ron told her cuttingly. “They might not
count as clothes. They didn’t look anything like hats to me, more like
woolly bladders.”
Hermione did not speak to him all morning.
Double Charms was succeeded by double Transfiguration. Profes-
sor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall both spent the first fifteen
minutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of
O.W.L.s.
“What you must remember,” said little Professor Flitwick squeak-
ily, perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top
of his desk, “is that these examinations may influence your futures for
many years to come! If you have not already given serious thought to
your careers, now is the time to do so. And in the meantime, I’m

256

afraid, we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do
yourselves justice!”
They then spent more than an hour reviewing Summoning Charms,
which according to Professor Flitwick were bound to come up in their
O.W.L., and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest
amount of Charms homework ever.
It was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration.
“You cannot pass an O.W.L.,” said Professor McGonagall grimly,
“without serious application, practice, and study. I see no reason why
everybody in this class should not achieve an O.W.L. in Transfiguration
as long as they put in the work.” Neville made a sad little disbeliev-
ing noise. “Yes, you too, Longbottom,” said Professor McGonagall.
“There’s nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence. So
. . . today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Con-
juring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until N.E.W.T.
level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be
tested on in your O.W.L.”
She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly dif-
ficult. By the end of a double period, neither he nor Ron had managed
to vanish the snails on which they were practicing, though Ron said
hopefully that he thought his looked a bit paler. Hermione, on the
other hand, successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt, earn-
ing her a ten-point bonus for Gryffindor from Professor McGonagall.
She was the only person not given homework; everybody else was told
to practice the spell overnight, ready for a fresh attempt on their snails
the following afternoon.
Now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had
to do, Harry and Ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up
the uses of moonstones in potion-making. Still angry about Ron’s slur
on her woolly hats, Hermione did not join them. By the time they
reached Care of Magical Creatures in the afternoon, Harry’s head was
aching again.

257
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The day had become cool and breezy, and, as they walked down
the sloping lawn toward Hagrid’s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden
Forest, they felt the occasional drop of rain on their faces. Professor
Grubbly-Plank stood waiting for the class some ten yards from Ha-
grid’s front door, a long trestle table in front of her laden with many
twigs. As Harry and Ron reached her, a loud shout of laughter
sounded behind them; turning, they saw Draco Malfoy striding to-
ward them, surrounded by his usual gang of Slytherin cronies. He had
clearly just said something highly amusing, because Crabbe, Goyle,
Pansy Parkinson, and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they
gathered around the trestle table. Judging by the fact that all of them
kept looking over at Harry, he was able to guess the subject of the joke
without too much difficulty.
“Everyone here?” barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, once all the
Slytherins and Gryffindors had arrived. “Let’s crack on then — who
can tell me what these things are called?”
She indicated the heap of twigs in front of her. Hermione’s hand
shot into the air. Behind her back, Malfoy did a buck-toothed imita-
tion of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question.
Pansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once
into a scream, as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed
themselves to be what looked like tiny pixieish creatures made of
wood, each with knobbly brown arms and legs, two twiglike fingers at
the end of each hand, and a funny, flat, barklike face in which a pair
of beetle-brown eyes glittered.
“Oooooh!” said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating Harry:
Anyone would have thought that Hagrid never showed them impres-
sive creatures; admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull, but
the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the
Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so.
“Kindly keep your voices down, girls!” said Professor Grubbly-
Plank sharply, scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice

258
DETENTION WITH
DOLORES
among the stick-creatures, who immediately fell upon the food.
“So — anyone know the names of these creatures? Miss Granger?”
“Bowtruckles,” said Hermione. “They’re tree-guardians, usually
live in wand-trees.”
“Five points for Gryffindor,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank. “Yes, these
are bowtruckles and, as Miss Granger rightly says, they generally live in
trees whose wood is of wand quality. Anybody know what they eat?”
“Wood lice,” said Hermione promptly, which explained why what
Harry had taken for grains of brown rice were moving. “But fairy eggs
if they can get them.”
“Good girl, take another five points. So whenever you need leaves
or wood from a tree in which a bowtruckle lodges, it is wise to have a
gift of wood lice ready to distract or placate it. They may not look
dangerous, but if angered they will gouge out human eyes with their
fingers, which, as you can see, are very sharp and not at all desirable
near the eyeballs. So if you’d like to gather closer, take a few wood lice
and a bowtruckle — I have enough here for one between three — you
can study them more closely. I want a sketch from each of you with all
body parts labeled by the end of the lesson.”
The class surged forward around the trestle table. Harry deliberately
circled around the back so that he ended up right next to Professor
Grubbly-Plank.
“Where’s Hagrid?” he asked her, while everyone else was choosing
bowtruckles.
“Never you mind,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank repressively,
which had been her attitude last time Hagrid had failed to turn up for
a class too. Smirking all over his pointed face, Draco Malfoy leaned
across Harry and seized the largest bowtruckle.
“Maybe,” said Malfoy in an undertone, so that only Harry could
hear him, “the stupid great oaf ’s got himself badly injured.”
“Maybe you will if you don’t shut up,” said Harry out of the side of
his mouth.

259
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“Maybe he’s been messing with stuff that’s too big for him, if you
get my drift.”
Malfoy walked away, smirking over his shoulder at Harry, who sud-
denly felt sick. Did Malfoy know something? His father was a Death
Eater, after all; what if he had information about Hagrid’s fate that
had not yet reached the Order’s ears? He hurried back around the
table to Ron and Hermione, who were squatting on the grass some
distance away and attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still
long enough to draw it. Harry pulled out parchment and quill,
crouched down beside the others, and related in a whisper what Mal-
foy had just said.
“Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid,”
said Hermione at once. “It’s just playing into Malfoy’s hands to look
worried, it tells him we don’t know exactly what’s going on. We’ve got
to ignore him, Harry. Here, hold the bowtruckle for a moment, just
so I can draw its face. . . .”
“Yes,” came Malfoy’s clear drawl from the group nearest them,
“Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you
know, and it sounds as though the Ministry’s really determined to
crack down on substandard teaching in this place. So even if that over-
grown moron does show up again, he’ll probably be sent packing
straight away.”
“OUCH!”
Harry had gripped the bowtruckle so hard that it had almost
snapped; it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its
sharp fingers, leaving two long deep cuts there. Harry dropped it;
Crabbe and Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea of Ha-
grid being sacked, laughed still harder as the bowtruckle set off at full
tilt toward the forest, a little, moving stickman soon swallowed up by
the tree roots. When the bell echoed distantly over the grounds Harry
rolled up his bloodstained bowtruckle picture and marched off to

260
DETENTION WITH

Herbology with his hand wrapped in a handkerchief of Hermione’s
and Malfoy’s derisive laughter still ringing in his ears.
“If he calls Hagrid a moron one more time . . .” snarled Harry.
“Harry, don’t go picking a row with Malfoy, don’t forget, he’s a pre-
fect now, he could make life difficult for you. . . .”
“Wow, I wonder what it’d be like to have a difficult life?” said Harry
sarcastically. Ron laughed, but Hermione frowned. Together they
traipsed across the vegetable patch. The sky still appeared unable to
make up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not.
“I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, that’s all,” said
Harry in a low voice, as they reached the greenhouses. “And don’t say
that Grubbly-Plank woman’s a better teacher!” he added threateningly.
“I wasn’t going to,” said Hermione calmly.
“Because she’ll never be as good as Hagrid,” said Harry firmly, fully
aware that he had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical
Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it.
The door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some fourth years
spilled out of it, including Ginny.
“Hi,” she said brightly as she passed. A few seconds later, Luna
Lovegood emerged, trailing behind the rest of the class, a smudge of
earth on her nose and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head.
When she saw Harry, her prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly
and she made a beeline straight for him. Many of his classmates
turned curiously to watch. Luna took a great breath and then said,
without so much as a preliminary hello: “I believe He-Who-Must-
Not-Be-Named is back, and I believe you fought him and escaped
from him.”
“Er — right,” said Harry awkwardly. Luna was wearing what
looked like a pair of orange radishes for earrings, a fact that Parvati
and Lavender seemed to have noticed, as they were both giggling and
pointing at her earlobes.

261
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“You can laugh!” Luna said, her voice rising, apparently under the
impression that Parvati and Lavender were laughing at what she had
said rather than what she was wearing. “But people used to believe there
were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-
Horned Snorkack!”
“Well, they were right, weren’t they?” said Hermione impatiently.
“There weren’t any such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the
Crumple-Horned Snorkack.”
Luna gave her a withering look and flounced away, radishes swing-
ing madly. Parvati and Lavender were not the only ones hooting with
laughter now.
“D’you mind not offending the only people who believe me?”
Harry asked Hermione as they made their way into class.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake, Harry, you can do better than her,” said
Hermione. “Ginny’s told me all about her, apparently she’ll only be-
lieve in things as long as there’s no proof at all. Well, I wouldn’t expect
anything else from someone whose father runs The Quibbler.”
Harry thought of the sinister winged horses he had seen on the
night he had arrived and how Luna had said she could see them too.
His spirits sank slightly. Had she been lying? But before he could de-
vote much more thought to the matter, Ernie Macmillan had stepped
up to him.
“I want you to know, Potter,” he said in a loud, carrying voice, “that
it’s not only weirdos who support you. I personally believe you one
hundred percent. My family have always stood firm behind Dumble-
dore, and so do I.”
“Er — thanks very much, Ernie,” said Harry, taken aback but
pleased. Ernie might be pompous on occasions like these, but Harry
was in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from some-
body who was not wearing radishes in their ears. Ernie’s words had
certainly wiped the smile from Lavender Brown’s face and, as he


turned to talk to Ron and Hermione, Harry caught Seamus’s expres-
sion, which looked both confused and defiant.
To nobody’s surprise, Professor Sprout started their lesson by lec-
turing them about the importance of O.W.L.s. Harry wished all the
teachers would stop doing this; he was starting to get an anxious,
twisted feeling in his stomach every time he remembered how much
homework he had to do, a feeling that worsened dramatically when
Professor Sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class. Tired
and smelling strongly of dragon dung, Professor Sprout’s preferred
brand of fertilizer, the Gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an
hour and a half later, none of them talking very much; it had been an-
other long day.
As Harry was starving, and he had his first detention with Um-
bridge at five o’clock, he headed straight for dinner without dropping
off his bag in Gryffindor Tower so that he could bolt something down
before facing whatever she had in store for him. He had barely reached
the entrance of the Great Hall, however, when a loud and angry voice
said, “Oy, Potter!”
“What now?” he muttered wearily, turning to face Angelina John-
son, who looked as though she was in a towering temper.
“I’ll tell you what now,” she said, marching straight up to him and
poking him hard in the chest with her finger. “How come you’ve
landed yourself in detention for five o’clock on Friday?”
“What?” said Harry. “Why . . . oh yeah, Keeper tryouts!”
“Now he remembers!” snarled Angelina. “Didn’t I tell you I wanted
to do a tryout with the whole team, and find someone who fitted in
with everyone? Didn’t I tell you I’d booked the Quidditch pitch spe-
cially? And now you’ve decided you’re not going to be there!”
“I didn’t decide not to be there!” said Harry, stung by the injustice
of these words. “I got detention from that Umbridge woman, just be-
cause I told her the truth about You-Know-Who —”

263
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“Well, you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off on
Friday,” said Angelina fiercely, “and I don’t care how you do it, tell her
You-Know-Who’s a figment of your imagination if you like, just make
sure you’re there!”
She stormed away.
“You know what?” Harry said to Ron and Hermione as they en-
tered the Great Hall. “I think we’d better check with Puddlemere
United whether Oliver Wood’s been killed during a training session,
because she seems to be channeling his spirit.”
“What d’you reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting you off on
Friday?” said Ron skeptically, as they sat down at the Gryffindor table.
“Less than zero,” said Harry glumly, tipping lamb chops onto his
plate and starting to eat. “Better try, though, hadn’t I? I’ll offer to do
two more detentions or something, I dunno. . . .” He swallowed a
mouthful of potato and added, “I hope she doesn’t keep me too long
this evening. You realize we’ve got to write three essays, practice Van-
ishing Spells for McGonagall, work out a countercharm for Flitwick,
finish the bowtruckle drawing, and start that stupid dream diary for
Trelawney?”
Ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling.
“And it looks like it’s going to rain.”
“What’s that got to do with our homework?” said Hermione, her
eyebrows raised.
“Nothing,” said Ron at once, his ears reddening.
At five to five Harry bade the other two good-bye and set off for
Umbridge’s office on the third floor. When he knocked on the door
she said, “Come in,” in a sugary voice. He entered cautiously, looking
around.
He had known this office under three of its previous occupants. In
the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had lived here it had been plastered
in beaming portraits of its owner. When Lupin had occupied it, it was
likely you would meet some fascinating Dark creature in a cage or


tank if you came to call. In the impostor Moody’s days it had been
packed with various instruments and artifacts for the detection of
wrongdoing and concealment.
Now, however, it looked totally unrecognizable. The surfaces had
all been draped in lacy covers and cloths. There were several vases full
of dried flowers, each residing on its own doily, and on one of the
walls was a collection of ornamental plates, each decorated with a
large technicolor kitten wearing a different bow around its neck.
These were so foul that Harry stared at them, transfixed, until Profes-
sor Umbridge spoke again.
“Good evening, Mr. Potter.”
Harry started and looked around. He had not noticed her at first
because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended
only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her.
“Evening,” Harry said stiffly.
“Well, sit down,” she said, pointing toward a small table draped in
lace beside which she had drawn up a straight-backed chair. A piece of
blank parchment lay on the table, apparently waiting for him.
“Er,” said Harry, without moving. “Professor Umbridge? Er —
before we start, I-I wanted to ask you a . . . a favor.”
Her bulging eyes narrowed.
“Oh yes?”
“Well I’m . . . I’m on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. And I was
supposed to be at the tryouts for the new Keeper at five o’clock on Fri-
day and I was — was wondering whether I could skip detention that
night and do it — do it another night . . . instead . . .”
He knew long before he reached the end of his sentence that it was
no good.
“Oh no,” said Umbridge, smiling so widely that she looked as
though she had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly. “Oh no, no, no.
This is your punishment for spreading evil, nasty, attention-seeking
stories, Mr. Potter, and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to

265
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
suit the guilty one’s convenience. No, you will come here at five
o’clock tomorrow, and the next day, and on Friday too, and you will
do your detentions as planned. I think it rather a good thing that you
are missing something you really want to do. It ought to reinforce the
lesson I am trying to teach you.”
Harry felt the blood surge to his head and heard a thumping noise
in his ears. So he told evil, nasty, attention-seeking stories, did he?
She was watching him with her head slightly to one side, still smil-
ing widely, as though she knew exactly what he was thinking and was
waiting to see whether he would start shouting again. With a massive
effort Harry looked away from her, dropped his schoolbag beside the
straight-backed chair, and sat down.
“There,” said Umbridge sweetly, “we’re getting better at controlling
our temper already, aren’t we? Now, you are going to be doing some
lines for me, Mr. Potter. No, not with your quill,” she added, as Harry
bent down to open his bag. “You’re going to be using a rather special
one of mine. Here you are.”
She handed him a long, thin black quill with an unusually sharp
point.
“I want you to write ‘I must not tell lies,’ ” she told him softly.
“How many times?” Harry asked, with a creditable imitation of
politeness.
“Oh, as long as it takes for the message to sink in,” said Umbridge
sweetly. “Off you go.”
She moved over to her desk, sat down, and bent over a stack of
parchment that looked like essays for marking. Harry raised the sharp
black quill and then realized what was missing.
“You haven’t given me any ink,” he said.
“Oh, you won’t need ink,” said Professor Umbridge with the mer-
est suggestion of a laugh in her voice.
Harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote: I must
not tell lies.

266
DETENTION WITH

He let out a gasp of pain. The words had appeared on the parch-
ment in what appeared to be shining red ink. At the same time, the
words had appeared on the back of Harry’s right hand, cut into his
skin as though traced there by a scalpel — yet even as he stared at the
shining cut, the skin healed over again, leaving the place where it had
been slightly redder than before but quite smooth.
Harry looked around at Umbridge. She was watching him, her
wide, toadlike mouth stretched in a smile.
“Yes?”
“Nothing,” said Harry quietly.
He looked back at the parchment, placed the quill upon it once
more, wrote I must not tell lies, and felt the searing pain on the back of
his hand for a second time; once again the words had been cut into his
skin, once again they healed over seconds later.
And on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the words on the
parchment in what he soon came to realize was not ink, but his own
blood. And again and again the words were cut into the back of his
hand, healed, and then reappeared the next time he set quill to
parchment.
Darkness fell outside Umbridge’s window. Harry did not ask when
he would be allowed to stop. He did not even check his watch. He
knew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not go-
ing to show any, not even if he had to sit here all night, cutting open
his own hand with this quill. . . .
“Come here,” she said, after what seemed hours.
He stood up. His hand was stinging painfully. When he looked
down at it he saw that the cut had healed, but that the skin there was
red raw.
“Hand,” she said.
He extended it. She took it in her own. Harry repressed a shudder
as she touched him with her thick, stubby fingers on which she wore
a number of ugly old rings.

267
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“Tut, tut, I don’t seem to have made much of an impression yet,”
she said, smiling. “Well, we’ll just have to try again tomorrow
evening, won’t we? You may go.”
Harry left her office without a word. The school was quite deserted;
it was surely past midnight. He walked slowly up the corridor then,
when he had turned the corner and was sure that she would not hear
him, broke into a run.
He had not had time to practice Vanishing Spells, had not written a
single dream in his dream diary, and had not finished the drawing of
the bowtruckle, nor had he written his essays. He skipped breakfast
next morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Div-
ination, their first lesson, and was surprised to find a disheveled Ron
keeping him company.
“How come you didn’t do it last night?” Harry asked, as Ron stared
wildly around the common room for inspiration. Ron, who had been
fast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered some-
thing about “doing other stuff,” bent low over his parchment, and
scrawled a few words.
“That’ll have to do,” he said, slamming the diary shut, “I’ve said I
dreamed I was buying a new pair of shoes, she can’t make anything
weird out of that, can she?”
They hurried off to North Tower together.
“How was detention with Umbridge, anyway? What did she make
you do?”
Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said, “Lines.”
“That’s not too bad, then, eh?” said Ron.
“Nope,” said Harry.
“Hey — I forgot — did she let you off for Friday?”
“No,” said Harry.
Ron groaned sympathetically.
It was another bad day for Harry; he was one of the worst in Trans-

268
DETENTION WITH

figuration, not having practiced Vanishing Spells at all. He had to give
up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle, and
meanwhile, Professors McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank, and Sinistra gave
them yet more homework, which he had no prospect of finishing that
evening because of his second detention with Umbridge. To cap it all,
Angelina Johnson tracked him down at dinner again and, on learning
that he would not be able to attend Friday’s Keeper tryouts, told him
she was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected play-
ers who wished to remain on the team to put training before their
other commitments.
“I’m in detention!” Harry yelled after her as she stalked away.
“D’you think I’d rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or play-
ing Quidditch?”
“At least it’s only lines,” said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank
back onto his bench and looked down at his steak-and-kidney pie,
which he no longer fancied very much. “It’s not as if it’s a dreadful
punishment, really. . . .”
Harry opened his mouth, closed it again, and nodded. He was not
really sure why he was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was
happening in Umbridge’s room: He only knew that he did not want
to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem
worse and therefore more difficult to face. He also felt dimly that this
was between himself and Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and he
was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had com-
plained about it.
“I can’t believe how much homework we’ve got,” said Ron
miserably.
“Well, why didn’t you do any last night?” Hermione asked him.
“Where were you anyway?”
“I was . . . I fancied a walk,” said Ron shiftily.
Harry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in con-
cealing things at the moment.

269
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

The second detention was just as bad as the previous one. The skin on
the back of Harry’s hand became irritated more quickly now, red and
inflamed; Harry thought it unlikely to keep healing as effectively for
long. Soon the cut would remain etched in his hand and Umbridge
would, perhaps, be satisfied. He let no moan of pain escape him, how-
ever, and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his
dismissal, again past midnight, he said nothing but “Good evening”
and “Good night.”
His homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when
he returned to the Gryffindor common room he did not, though ex-
hausted, go to bed, but opened his books and began Snape’s moon-
stone essay. It was half-past two by the time he had finished it. He
knew he had done a poor job, but there was no help for it; unless he
had something to give in he would be in detention with Snape next.
He then dashed off answers to the questions Professor McGonagall
had set them, cobbled together something on the proper handling of
bowtruckles for Professor Grubbly-Plank, and staggered up to bed,
where he fell fully clothed on top of the bed covers and fell asleep
immediately.
Thursday passed in a haze of tiredness. Ron seemed very sleepy too,
though Harry could not see why he should be. Harry’s third detention
passed in the same way as the previous two, except that after two
hours the words “I must not tell lies” did not fade from the back of
Harry’s hand, but remained scratched there, oozing droplets of blood.
The pause in the pointed quill’s scratching made Professor Umbridge
look up.
“Ah,” she said softly, moving around her desk to examine his hand
herself. “Good. That ought to serve as a reminder to you, oughtn’t it?
You may leave for tonight.”

270

“Do I still have to come back tomorrow?” said Harry, picking up
his schoolbag with his left hand rather than his smarting right.
“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge, smiling widely as before. “Yes,
I think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evening’s
work.”
He had never before considered the possibility that there might be
another teacher in the world he hated more than Snape, but as he
walked back toward Gryffindor Tower he had to admit he had found
a contender. She’s evil, he thought, as he climbed a staircase to the sev-
enth floor, she’s an evil, twisted, mad, old —
“Ron?”
He had reached the top of the stairs, turned right, and almost
walked into Ron, who was lurking behind a statue of Lachlan the
Lanky, clutching his broomstick. He gave a great leap of surprise
when he saw Harry and attempted to hide his new Cleansweep Eleven
behind his back.
“What are you doing?”
“Er — nothing. What are you doing?”
Harry frowned at him.
“Come on, you can tell me! What are you hiding here for?”
“I’m — I’m hiding from Fred and George, if you must know,” said
Ron. “They just went past with a bunch of first years, I bet they’re
testing stuff on them again, I mean, they can’t do it in the common
room now, can they, not with Hermione there.”
He was talking in a very fast, feverish way.
“But what have you got your broom for, you haven’t been flying,
have you?” Harry asked.
“I — well — well, okay, I’ll tell you, but don’t laugh, all right?” Ron
said defensively, turning redder with every second. “I-I thought I’d try
out for Gryffindor Keeper now I’ve got a decent broom. There. Go on.
Laugh.”

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“I’m not laughing,” said Harry. Ron blinked. “It’s a brilliant idea!
It’d be really cool if you got on the team! I’ve never seen you play
Keeper, are you good?”
“I’m not bad,” said Ron, who looked immensely relieved at Harry’s
reaction. “Charlie, Fred, and George always made me Keep for them
when they were training during the holidays.”
“So you’ve been practicing tonight?”
“Every evening since Tuesday . . . just on my own, though, I’ve
been trying to bewitch Quaffles to fly at me, but it hasn’t been easy
and I don’t know how much use it’ll be.” Ron looked nervous and
anxious. “Fred and George are going to laugh themselves stupid when
I turn up for the tryouts. They haven’t stopped taking the mickey out
of me since I got made a prefect.”
“I wish I was going to be there,” said Harry bitterly, as they set off
together toward the common room.
“Yeah, so do — Harry, what’s that on the back of your hand?”
Harry, who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand,
tried to hide it, but had as much success as Ron with his Cleansweep.
“It’s just a cut — it’s nothing — it’s —”
But Ron had grabbed Harry’s forearm and pulled the back of
Harry’s hand up level with his eyes. There was a pause, during which
he stared at the words carved into the skin, then he released Harry,
looking sick.
“I thought you said she was giving you lines?”
Harry hesitated, but after all, Ron had been honest with him, so he
told Ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in Um-
bridge’s office.
“The old hag!” Ron said in a revolted whisper as they came to a halt
in front of the Fat Lady, who was dozing peacefully with her head
against her frame. “She’s sick! Go to McGonagall, say something!”
“No,” said Harry at once. “I’m not giving her the satisfaction of
knowing she’s got to me.”


“Got to you? You can’t let her get away with this!”
“I don’t know how much power McGonagall’s got over her,” said
Harry.
“Dumbledore, then, tell Dumbledore!”
“No,” said Harry flatly.
“Why not?”
“He’s got enough on his mind,” said Harry, but that was not the
true reason. He was not going to go to Dumbledore for help when
Dumbledore had not spoken to him once since last June.
“Well, I reckon you should —” Ron began, but he was interrupted
by the Fat Lady, who had been watching them sleepily and now burst
out, “Are you going to give me the password or will I have to stay
awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation?”
Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week. Though
Harry glanced toward the staff table automatically when he entered
the Great Hall, it was without real hope of seeing Hagrid and he
turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems, such as
the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of
yet another detention with Umbridge.
Two things sustained Harry that day. One was the thought that it
was almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though his final
detention with Umbridge was sure to be, he had a distant view of the
Quidditch pitch from her window and might, with luck, be able to
see something of Ron’s tryout. These were rather feeble rays of light, it
was true, but Harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his
present darkness; he had never had a worse first week of term at
Hogwarts.
At five o’clock that evening he knocked on Professor Umbridge’s
office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time, was
told to enter and did so. The blank parchment lay ready for him on
the lace-covered table, the pointed black quill beside it.

273
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“You know what to do, Mr. Potter,” said Umbridge, smiling
sweetly over at him.
Harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window. If he
just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right . . . On the pretext of
shifting himself closer to the table he managed it. He now had a dis-
tant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the
pitch, while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three
high goalposts, apparently awaiting their turn to Keep. It was impos-
sible to tell which one was Ron at this distance.
I must not tell lies, Harry wrote. The cut in the back of his right
hand opened and began to bleed afresh.
I must not tell lies. The cut dug deeper, stinging and smarting.
I must not tell lies. Blood trickled down his wrist.
He chanced another glance out of the window. Whoever was de-
fending the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed. Katie
Bell scored twice in the few seconds Harry dared watch. Hoping very
much that the Keeper wasn’t Ron, he dropped his eyes back to the
parchment dotted with blood.
I must not tell lies.
I must not tell lies.
He looked up whenever he thought he could risk it, when he could
hear the scratching of Umbridge’s quill or the opening of a desk
drawer. The third person to try out was pretty good, the fourth was
terrible, the fifth dodged a Bludger exceptionally well but then fum-
bled an easy save. The sky was darkening so that Harry doubted he
would be able to watch the sixth and seventh people at all.
I must not tell lies.
I must not tell lies.
The parchment was now shining with drops of blood from the back
of his hand, which was searing with pain. When he next looked up,
night had fallen and the Quidditch pitch was no longer visible.

“Let’s see if you’ve gotten the message yet, shall we?” said Um-
bridge’s soft voice half an hour later.
She moved toward him, stretching out her short be-ringed fingers
for his arm. And then, as she took hold of him to examine the words
now cut into his skin, pain seared, not across the back of his hand, but
across the scar on his forehead. At the same time, he had a most pe-
culiar sensation somewhere around his midriff.
He wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet, staring at
her. She looked back at him, a smile stretching her wide, slack mouth.
“Yes, it hurts, doesn’t it?” she said softly.
He did not answer. His heart was thumping very hard and fast. Was
she talking about his hand or did she know what he had just felt in his
forehead?
“Well, I think I’ve made my point, Mr. Potter. You may go.”
He caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he
could.
Stay calm, he told himself as he sprinted up the stairs. Stay calm, it
doesn’t necessarily mean what you think it means. . . .
“Mimbulus mimbletonia!” he gasped at the Fat Lady, who swung
forward once more.
A roar of sound greeted him. Ron came running toward him,
beaming all over his face and slopping butterbeer down his front from
the goblet he was clutching.
“Harry, I did it, I’m in, I’m Keeper!”
“What? Oh — brilliant!” said Harry, trying to smile naturally,
while his heart continued to race and his hand throbbed and bled.
“Have a butterbeer.” Ron pressed a bottle onto him. “I can’t believe
it — where’s Hermione gone?”
“She’s there,” said Fred, who was also swigging butterbeer, and
pointed to an armchair by the fire. Hermione was dozing in it, her
drink tipping precariously in her hand.

275
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“Well, she said she was pleased when I told her,” said Ron, looking
slightly put out.
“Let her sleep,” said George hastily. It was a few moments before
Harry noticed that several of the first years gathered around them bore
unmistakable signs of recent nosebleeds.
“Come here, Ron, and see if Oliver’s old robes fit you,” called Katie
Bell. “We can take off his name and put yours on instead. . . .”
As Ron moved away, Angelina came striding up to Harry.
“Sorry I was a bit short with you earlier, Potter,” she said abruptly.
“It’s stressful, this managing lark, you know, I’m starting to think I
was a bit hard on Wood sometimes.” She was watching Ron over the
rim of her goblet with a slight frown on her face.
“Look, I know he’s your best mate, but he’s not fabulous,” she said
bluntly. “I think with a bit of training he’ll be all right, though. He
comes from a family of good Quidditch players. I’m banking on him
turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today, to
be honest. Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better
this evening, but Hooper’s a real whiner, he’s always moaning about
something or other, and Vicky’s involved in all sorts of societies, she
admitted herself that if training clashed with her Charm Club she’d
put Charms first. Anyway, we’re having a practice session at two
o’clock tomorrow, so just make sure you’re there this time. And do me
a favor and help Ron as much as you can, okay?”
He nodded and Angelina strolled back to Alicia Spinnet. Harry
moved over to sit next to Hermione, who awoke with a jerk as he put
down his bag.
“Oh, Harry, it’s you. . . . Good about Ron, isn’t it?” she said
blearily. “I’m just so — so — so tired,” she yawned. “I was up until
one o’clock making more hats. They’re disappearing like mad!”
And sure enough, now that he looked, Harry saw that there were
woolly hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might
accidentally pick them up.


“Great,” said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon,
he would burst. “Listen, Hermione, I was just up in Umbridge’s office
and she touched my arm . . .”
Hermione listened closely. When Harry had finished she said
slowly, “You’re worried that You-Know-Who’s controlling her like he
controlled Quirrell?”
“Well,” said Harry, dropping his voice, “it’s a possibility, isn’t it?”
“I suppose so,” said Hermione, though she sounded unconvinced.
“But I don’t think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quir-
rell, I mean, he’s properly alive again now, isn’t he, he’s got his own
body, he wouldn’t need to share someone else’s. He could have her un-
der the Imperius Curse, I suppose. . . .”
Harry watched Fred, George, and Lee Jordan juggling empty but-
terbeer bottles for a moment. Then Hermione said, “But last year
your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn’t Dumble-
dore say it had to do with what You-Know-Who was feeling at the
time? I mean, maybe this hasn’t got anything to do with Umbridge at
all, maybe it’s just coincidence it happened while you were with her?”
“She’s evil,” said Harry flatly. “Twisted.”
“She’s horrible, yes, but . . . Harry, I think you ought to tell Dum-
bledore your scar hurt.”
It was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to
Dumbledore and his answer to Hermione was just the same as his an-
swer to Ron.
“I’m not bothering him with this. Like you just said, it’s not a big
deal. It’s been hurting on and off all summer — it was just a bit worse
tonight, that’s all —”
“Harry, I’m sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by
this —”
“Yeah,” said Harry, before he could stop himself, “that’s the only bit
of me Dumbledore cares about, isn’t it, my scar?”
“Don’t say that, it’s not true!”


CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“I think I’ll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he thinks —”
“Harry, you can’t put something like that in a letter!” said
Hermione, looking alarmed. “Don’t you remember, Moody told us to
be careful what we put in writing! We just can’t guarantee owls aren’t
being intercepted anymore!”
“All right, all right, I won’t tell him, then!” said Harry irritably. He
got to his feet. “I’m going to bed. Tell Ron for me, will you?”
“Oh no,” said Hermione, looking relieved, “if you’re going that
means I can go without being rude too, I’m absolutely exhausted and
I want to make some more hats tomorrow. Listen, you can help me if
you like, it’s quite fun, I’m getting better, I can do patterns and bob-
bles and all sorts of things now.”
Harry looked into her face, which was shining with glee, and tried
to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer.
“Er . . . no, I don’t think I will, thanks,” he said. “Er — not tomor-
row. I’ve got loads of homework to do. . . .”
And he traipsed off to the boys’ stairs, leaving her looking slightly
disappointed behind him.

H
arry was the first to awake in his dormitory next morning.
He lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the chink of
sunlight falling through the gap in his four-poster’s hangings and sa-
vored the thought that it was Saturday. The first week of term seemed
to have dragged on forever, like one gigantic History of Magic lesson.
Judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that
beam of sunlight, it was just after daybreak. He pulled open the cur-
tains around his bed, got up, and started to dress. The only sound
apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow, deep breathing
of his fellow Gryffindors. He opened his schoolbag carefully, pulled
out parchment and quill, and headed out of the dormitory for the
common room.
Making straight for his favorite squashy old armchair beside the
now extinct fire, Harry settled himself down comfortably and un-
rolled his parchment while looking around the room. The detritus of
crumpled-up bits of parchment, old Gobstones, empty ingredient jars,
and candy wrappers that usually covered the common room at the
end of each day was gone, as were all Hermione’s elf hats. Wondering

279
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted
to be or not, Harry uncorked his ink bottle, dipped his quill into it,
and then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish sur-
face of his parchment, thinking hard. . . . But after a minute or so he
found himself staring into the empty grate, at a complete loss for what
to say.
He could now appreciate how hard it had been for Ron and
Hermione to write him letters over the summer. How was he sup-
posed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past week
and pose all the questions he was burning to ask without giving po-
tential letter-thieves a lot of information he did not want them to
have?
He sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace, then,
finally coming to a decision, he dipped his quill into the ink bottle
once more and set it resolutely upon the parchment.
Dear Snuffles,
Hope you’re okay, the first week back here’s been terrible, I’m
really glad it’s the weekend.
We’ve got a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Pro-
fessor Umbridge. She’s nearly as nice as your mum. I’m writing
because that thing I wrote to you about last summer happened
again last night when I was doing a detention with Umbridge.
We’re all missing our biggest friend, we hope he’ll be back soon.
Please write back quickly.
Best,
Harry reread this letter several times, trying to see it from the point
of view of an outsider. He could not see how they would know what
he was talking about — or who he was talking to — just from reading

280
PERCY AND PADFOOT
this letter. He did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about Hagrid
and tell them when he might be back: Harry did not want to ask di-
rectly in case it drew too much attention to what Hagrid might be up
to while he was not at Hogwarts.
Considering it was a very short letter it had taken a long time to
write; sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been
working on it, and he could now hear distant sounds of movement
from the dormitories above. Sealing the parchment carefully he
climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the Owlery.
“I would not go that way if I were you,” said Nearly Headless Nick,
drifting disconcertingly through a wall just ahead of him as he walked
down the passage. “Peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next
person to pass the bust of Paracelsus halfway down the corridor.”
“Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the person’s head?”
asked Harry.
“Funnily enough, it does,” said Nearly Headless Nick in a bored
voice. “Subtlety has never been Peeves’s strong point. I’m off to try
and find the Bloody Baron. . . . He might be able to put a stop to it.
. . . See you, Harry. . . .”
“Yeah, ’bye,” said Harry and instead of turning right, he turned left,
taking a longer but safer route up to the Owlery. His spirits rose as he
walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky; he had
training later, he would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last —
Something brushed his ankles. He looked down and saw the care-
taker’s skeletal gray cat, Mrs. Norris, slinking past him. She turned
lamplike yellow eyes upon him for a moment before disappearing be-
hind a statue of Wilfred the Wistful.
“I’m not doing anything wrong,” Harry called after her. She had
the unmistakable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss, yet
Harry could not see why; he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the
Owlery on a Saturday morning.
The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the

281
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Owlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes; thick silvery beams of
sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nes-
tled on rafters, a little restless in the early morning light, some clearly
just returned from hunting. The straw-covered floor crunched a little
as he stepped across tiny animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of
Hedwig.
“There you are,” he said, spotting her somewhere near the very top
of the vaulted ceiling. “Get down here, I’ve got a letter for you.”
With a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared
down onto his shoulder.
“Right, I know this says ‘Snuffles’ on the outside,” he told her, giv-
ing her the letter to clasp in her beak and, without knowing exactly
why, whispering, “but it’s for Sirius, okay?”
She blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she
understood.
“Safe flight, then,” said Harry and he carried her to one of the win-
dows; with a moment’s pressure on his arm Hedwig took off into the
blindingly bright sky. He watched her until she became a tiny black
speck and vanished, then switched his gaze to Hagrid’s hut, clearly vis-
ible from this window, and just as clearly uninhabited, the chimney
smokeless, the curtains drawn.
The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze.
Harry watched them, savoring the fresh air on his face, thinking about
Quidditch later . . . and then he saw it. A great, reptilian winged
horse, just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leathery
black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl’s, rose up out of the trees
like a grotesque, giant bird. It soared in a great circle and then plunged
once more into the trees. The whole thing had happened so quickly
Harry could hardly believe what he had seen, except that his heart was
hammering madly.
The Owlery door opened behind him. He leapt in shock, and turn-
ing quickly, saw Cho Chang holding a letter and a parcel in her hands.

282
PERCY AND PADFOOT
“Hi,” said Harry automatically.
“Oh . . . hi,” she said breathlessly. “I didn’t think anyone would be
up here this early. . . . I only remembered five minutes ago, it’s my
mum’s birthday.”
She held up the parcel.
“Right,” said Harry. His brain seemed to have jammed. He wanted
to say something funny and interesting, but the memory of that terri-
ble winged horse was fresh in his mind.
“Nice day,” he said, gesturing to the windows. His insides seemed
to shrivel with embarrassment. The weather. He was talking about the
weather. . . .
“Yeah,” said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl. “Good Quid-
ditch conditions. I haven’t been out all week, have you?”
“No,” said Harry.
Cho had selected one of the school barn owls. She coaxed it down
onto her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach
the parcel.
“Hey, has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet?” she asked.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “It’s my friend Ron Weasley, d’you know him?”
“The Tornado-hater?” said Cho rather coolly. “Is he any good?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “I think so. I didn’t see his tryout, though, I was
in detention.”
Cho looked up, the parcel only half-attached to the owl’s legs.
“That Umbridge woman’s foul,” she said in a low voice. “Putting
you in detention just because you told the truth about how — how
— how he died. Everyone heard about it, it was all over the school.
You were really brave standing up to her like that.”
Harry’s insides reinflated so rapidly he felt as though he might ac-
tually float a few inches off the dropping-strewn floor. Who cared
about a stupid flying horse, Cho thought he had been really brave. . . .
For a moment he considered accidentally-on-purpose showing her his
cut hand as he helped her tie her parcel onto her owl. . . . But the very

283
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
instant that this thrilling thought occurred, the Owlery door opened
again.
Filch, the caretaker, came wheezing into the room. There were pur-
ple patches on his sunken, veined cheeks, his jowls were aquiver and
his thin gray hair disheveled; he had obviously run here. Mrs. Norris
came trotting at his heels, gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing
hungrily. There was a restless shifting of wings from above, and a large
brown owl snapped his beak in a menacing fashion.
“Aha!” said Filch, taking a flat-footed step toward Harry, his
pouchy cheeks trembling with anger. “I’ve had a tip-off that you are
intending to place a massive order for Dungbombs!”
Harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker.
“Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs?”
Cho was looking from Harry to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl
on her arm, tired of standing on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but
she ignored it.
“I have my sources,” said Filch in a self-satisfied hiss. “Now hand
over whatever it is you’re sending.”
Feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off
the letter, Harry said, “I can’t, it’s gone.”
“Gone?” said Filch, his face contorting with rage.
“Gone,” said Harry calmly.
Filch opened his mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then
raked Harry’s robes with his eyes. “How do I know you haven’t got it
in your pocket?”
“Because —”
“I saw him send it,” said Cho angrily.
Filch rounded on her.
“You saw him — ?”
“That’s right, I saw him,” she said fiercely.
There was a moment’s pause in which Filch glared at Cho and Cho

284
PERCY AND PADFOOT
glared right back, then the caretaker turned and shuffled back toward
the door. He stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at
Harry.
“If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb . . .”
He stumped off down the stairs. Mrs. Norris cast a last longing
look at the owls and followed him.
Harry and Cho looked at each other.
“Thanks,” Harry said.
“No problem,” said Cho, finally fixing the parcel to the barn owl’s
other leg, her face slightly pink. “You weren’t ordering Dungbombs,
were you?”
“No,” said Harry.
“I wonder why he thought you were, then?” she said, as she carried
the owl to the window.
Harry shrugged; he was quite as mystified by that as she was,
though, oddly, it was not bothering him very much at the moment.
They left the Owlery together. At the entrance of a corridor that led
toward the west wing of the castle, Cho said, “I’m going this way.
Well, I’ll . . . I’ll see you around, Harry.”
“Yeah . . . see you.”
She smiled at him and departed. He walked on, feeling quietly
elated. He had managed to have an entire conversation with her and
not embarrassed himself once. . . . You were really brave standing up to
her like that. . . . She had called him brave. . . . She did not hate him
for being alive. . . .
Of course, she had preferred Cedric, he knew that. . . . Though if
he’d only asked her to the ball before Cedric had, things might have
turned out differently. . . . She had seemed sincerely sorry that she
had to refuse when Harry had asked her. . . .
“Morning,” Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione, joining
them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall.

285
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
“What are you looking so pleased about?” said Ron, eyeing Harry
in surprise.
“Erm . . . Quidditch later,” said Harry happily, pulling a large plat-
ter of bacon and eggs toward him.
“Oh . . . yeah . . .” said Ron. He put down the bit of toast he was
eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice. Then he said, “Listen
. . . you don’t fancy going out a bit earlier with me, do you? Just to —
er — give me some practice before training? So I can, you know, get
my eye in a bit . . .”
“Yeah, okay,” said Harry.
“Look, I don’t think you should,” said Hermione seriously, “you’re
both really behind on homework as it —”
But she broke off; the morning post was arriving and, as usual, the
Daily Prophet was soaring toward her in the beak of a screech owl,
which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg;
Hermione pushed a Knut into its leather pouch, took the newspaper,
and scanned the front page critically as the owl took off again.
“Anything interesting?” said Ron; Harry smiled — he knew Ron
was keen to get her off the subject of homework.
“No,” she sighed, “just some guff about the bass player in the
Weird Sisters getting married. . . .”
She opened the paper and disappeared behind it. Harry devoted
himself to another helping of eggs and bacon; Ron was staring up at
the high windows, looking slightly preoccupied.
“Wait a moment,” said Hermione suddenly. “Oh no . . . Sirius!”
“What’s happened?” said Harry, and he snatched at the paper so
violently that it ripped down the middle so that he and Hermione
were holding half each.
“ ‘The Ministry of Magic has received a tip-off from a reliable source
that Sirius Black, notorious mass murderer . . . blah blah blah . . . is cur-
rently hiding in London!’ ” Hermione read from her half in an anguished
whisper.

286
PERCY AND PADFOOT
“Lucius Malfoy, I’ll bet anything,” said Harry in a low, furious
voice. “He did recognize Sirius on the platform. . . .”
“What?” said Ron, looking alarmed. “You didn’t say —”
“Shh!” said the other two.
“. . . ‘Ministry warns Wizarding community that Black is very danger-
ous . . . killed thirteen people . . . broke out of Azkaban . . .’ the usual
rubbish,” Hermione concluded, laying down her half of the paper and
looking fearfully at Harry and Ron. “Well, he just won’t be able to
leave the house again, that’s all,” she whispered. “Dumbledore did
warn him not to.”
Harry looked down glumly at the bit of the Prophet he had torn off.
Most of the page was devoted to an advertisement for Madame
Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions, which was apparently having a sale.
“Hey!” he said, flattening it down so Hermione and Ron could
both see it. “Look at this!”
“I’ve got all the robes I want,” said Ron.
“No,” said Harry, “look . . . this little piece here . . .”
Ron and Hermione bent closer to read it; the item was barely an
inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column. It was head-
lined:
TRESPASS AT MINISTRY
Sturgis Podmore, 38, of number two, Laburnum
Gardens, Clapham, has appeared in front of the
Wizengamot charged with trespass and attempted
robbery at the Ministry of Magic on 31st August.
Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watch-
wizard Eric Munch, who found him attempting to
force his way through a top-security door at one
o’clock in the morning. Podmore, who refused to
speak in his own defense, was convicted on both
charges and sentenced to six months in Azkaban.


“Sturgis Podmore?” said Ron slowly, “but he’s that bloke who looks
like his head’s been thatched, isn’t he? He’s one of the Ord —”
“Ron, shh!” said Hermione, casting a terrified look around them.
“Six months in Azkaban!” whispered Harry, shocked. “Just for try-
ing to get through a door!”
“Don’t be silly, it wasn’t just for trying to get through a door —
what on earth was he doing at the Ministry of Magic at one o’clock in
the morning?” breathed Hermione.
“D’you reckon he was doing something for the Order?” Ron
muttered.
“Wait a moment. . . .” said Harry slowly. “Sturgis was supposed to
come and see us off, remember?”
The other two looked at him.
“Yeah, he was supposed to be part of our guard going to King’s
Cross, remember? And Moody was all annoyed because he didn’t turn
up, so that doesn’t seem like he was supposed to be on a job for them,
does it?”
“Well, maybe they didn’t expect him to get caught,” said
Hermione.
“It could be a frame-up!” Ron exclaimed excitedly. “No — listen!”
he went on, dropping his voice dramatically at the threatening look
on Hermione’s face. “The Ministry suspects he’s one of Dumbledore’s
lot so — I dunno — they lured him to the Ministry, and he wasn’t
trying to get through a door at all! Maybe they’ve just made some-
thing up to get him!”
There was a pause while Harry and Hermione considered this.
Harry thought it seemed far-fetched; Hermione, on the other hand,
looked rather impressed and said, “Do you know, I wouldn’t be at all
surprised if that were true.”
She folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully. When Harry
laid down his knife and fork she seemed to come out of a reverie.

“Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on Self-
Fertilizing Shrubs first, and if we’re lucky we’ll be able to start McGo-
nagall’s Inanimatus Conjurus before lunch. . . .”
Harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of
homework awaiting him upstairs, but the sky was a clear, exhilarating
blue, and he had not been on his Firebolt for a week. . . .
“I mean, we can do it tonight,” said Ron, as he and Harry walked
down the sloping lawns toward the Quidditch pitch, their broom-
sticks over their shoulders, Hermione’s dire warnings that they would
fail all their O.W.L.s still ringing in their ears. “And we’ve got tomor-
row. She gets too worked up about work, that’s her trouble. . . .” There
was a pause and he added, in a slightly more anxious tone, “D’you
think she meant it when she said we weren’t copying from her?”
“Yeah, I do,” said Harry. “Still, this is important too, we’ve got to
practice if we want to stay on the Quidditch team. . . .”
“Yeah, that’s right,” said Ron in a heartened tone. “And we have got
plenty of time to do it all. . . .”
Harry glanced over to his right as they approached the Quidditch
pitch, to where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly.
Nothing flew out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant
owls fluttering around the Owlery Tower. He had enough to worry
about; the flying horse wasn’t doing him any harm: He pushed it out
of his mind.
They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and
set to work, Ron guarding the three tall goalposts, Harry playing
Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past Ron. Harry thought Ron
was pretty good; he blocked three-quarters of the goals Harry at-
tempted to put past him and played better the longer they practiced.
After a couple of hours they returned to the school, where they ate
lunch, during which Hermione made it quite clear that she thought
they were irresponsible, then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the

289
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
real training session. All their teammates but Angelina were already in
the changing room when they entered.
“All right, Ron?” said George, winking at him.
“Yeah,” said Ron, who had become quieter and quieter all the way
down to the pitch.
“Ready to show us all up, Ickle Prefect?” said Fred, emerging
tousle-haired from the neck of his Quidditch robes, a slightly mali-
cious grin on his face.
“Shut up,” said Ron, stony-faced, pulling on his own team robes
for the first time. They fitted him well considering they had been
Oliver Wood’s, who was rather broader in the shoulder.
“Okay everyone,” said Angelina, entering from the Captain’s office,
already changed. “Let’s get to it; Alicia and Fred, if you can just bring
the ball crate out for us. Oh, and there are a couple of people out there
watching but I want you to just ignore them, all right?”
Something in her would-be casual voice made Harry think he
might know who the uninvited spectators were, and sure enough,
when they left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch
it was to a storm of catcalls and jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch
team and assorted hangers-on, who were grouped halfway up the
empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly around the stadium.
“What’s that Weasley’s riding?” Malfoy called in his sneering drawl.
“Why would anyone put a Flying Charm on a moldy old log like
that?”
Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with
laughter. Ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground
and Harry followed him, watching his ears turn red from behind.
“Ignore them,” he said, accelerating to catch up with Ron. “We’ll
see who’s laughing after we play them. . . .”
“Exactly the attitude I want, Harry,” said Angelina approvingly,
soaring around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowing to
hover on the spot in front of her airborne team. “Okay everyone, we’re

290
PERCY AND PADFOOT
going to start with some passes just to warm up, the whole team
please —”
“Hey, Johnson, what’s with that hairstyle anyway?” shrieked Pansy
Parkinson from below. “Why would anyone want to look like they’ve
got worms coming out of their head?”
Angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and said
calmly, “Spread out, then, and let’s see what we can do. . . .”
Harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch.
Ron fell back toward the opposite goal. Angelina raised the Quaffle
with one hand and threw it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who
passed to Harry, who passed to Ron, who dropped it.
The Slytherins, led by Malfoy, roared and screamed with laughter.
Ron, who had pelted toward the ground to catch the Quaffle before it
landed, pulled out of the dive untidily, so that he slipped sideways on
his broom, and returned to playing height, blushing. Harry saw Fred
and George exchange looks, but uncharacteristically neither of them
said anything, for which he was grateful.
“Pass it on, Ron,” called Angelina, as though nothing had happened.
Ron threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to Harry, who
passed to George. . . .
“Hey, Potter, how’s your scar feeling?” called Malfoy. “Sure you
don’t need a lie-down? It must be, what, a whole week since you were
in the hospital wing, that’s a record for you, isn’t it?”
Fred passed to Angelina; she reverse passed to Harry, who had not
been expecting it, but caught it in the very tips of his fingers and
passed it quickly to Ron, who lunged for it and missed by inches.
“Come on now, Ron,” said Angelina crossly, as Ron dived for the
ground again, chasing the Quaffle. “Pay attention.”
It would have been hard to say whether Ron’s face or the Quaffle
was a deeper scarlet when he returned again to playing height. Malfoy
and the rest of the Slytherin team were howling with laughter.
On his third attempt, Ron caught the Quaffle; perhaps out of relief

291
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight through
Katie’s outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face.
“Sorry!” Ron groaned, zooming forward to see whether he had
done any damage.
“Get back in position, she’s fine!” barked Angelina. “But as you’re
passing to a teammate, do try not to knock her off her broom, won’t
you? We’ve got Bludgers for that!”
Katie’s nose was bleeding. Down below the Slytherins were stamp-
ing their feet and jeering. Fred and George converged on Katie.
“Here, take this,” Fred told her, handing her something small and
purple from out of his pocket. “It’ll clear it up in no time.”
“All right,” called Angelina, “Fred, George, go and get your bats
and a Bludger; Ron, get up to the goalposts, Harry, release the Snitch
when I say so. We’re going to aim for Ron’s goal, obviously.”
Harry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the Snitch.
“Ron’s making a right pig’s ear of things, isn’t he?” muttered
George, as the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls
and opened it to extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch.
“He’s just nervous,” said Harry. “He was fine when I was practicing
with him this morning.”
“Yeah, well, I hope he hasn’t peaked too soon,” said Fred gloomily.
They returned to the air. When Angelina blew her whistle, Harry
released the Snitch and Fred and George let fly the Bludger; from that
moment on, Harry was barely aware of what the others were doing. It
was his job to recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth
a hundred and fifty points to the Seeker’s team and doing so required
enormous speed and skill. He accelerated, rolling and swerving in and
out of the Chasers, the warm autumn air whipping his face and the
distant yells of the Slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ears.
. . . But too soon, the whistle brought him to a halt again.
“Stop — stop – STOP!” screamed Angelina. “Ron — you’re not
covering your middle post!”

292
PERCY AND PADFOOT
Harry looked around at Ron, who was hovering in front of the left-
hand hoop, leaving the other two completely unprotected.
“Oh . . . sorry . . .”
“You keep shifting around while you’re watching the Chasers!” said
Angelina. “Either stay in center position until you have to move to de-
fend a hoop, or else circle the hoops, but don’t drift vaguely off to one
side, that’s how you let in the last three goals!”
“Sorry . . .” Ron repeated, his red face shining like a beacon against
the bright blue sky.
“And Katie, can’t you do something about that nosebleed?”
“It’s just getting worse!” said Katie thickly, attempting to stem the
flow with her sleeve.
Harry glanced around at Fred, who was looking anxious and check-
ing his pockets. He saw Fred pull out something purple, examine it
for a second, and then look around at Katie, evidently horrorstruck.
“Well, let’s try again,” said Angelina. She was ignoring the Slyth-
erins, who had now set up a chant of “Gryffindor are losers, Gryffindor
are losers,” but there was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom
nevertheless.
This time they had been flying for barely three minutes when
Angelina’s whistle sounded. Harry, who had just sighted the Snitch
circling the opposite goalpost, pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved.
“What now?” he said impatiently to Alicia, who was nearest.
“Katie,” she said shortly.
Harry turned and saw Angelina, Fred, and George all flying as fast
as they could toward Katie. Harry and Alicia sped toward her too. It
was plain that Angelina had stopped training just in time; Katie was
now chalk-white and covered in blood.
“She needs the hospital wing,” said Angelina.
“We’ll take her,” said Fred. “She — er — might have swallowed a
Blood Blisterpod by mistake —”
“Well, there’s no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser

293
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
gone,” said Angelina glumly, as Fred and George zoomed off toward
the castle supporting Katie between them. “Come on, let’s go and get
changed.”
The Slytherins continued to chant as they trailed back into the
changing rooms.
“How was practice?” asked Hermione rather coolly half an hour
later, as Harry and Ron climbed through the portrait hole into the
Gryffindor common room.
“It was —” Harry began.
“Completely lousy,” said Ron in a hollow voice, sinking into a chair
beside Hermione. She looked up at Ron and her frostiness seemed to
melt.
“Well, it was only your first one,” she said consolingly, “it’s bound
to take time to —”
“Who said it was me who made it lousy?” snapped Ron.
“No one,” said Hermione, looking taken aback, “I thought —”
“You thought I was bound to be rubbish?”
“No, of course I didn’t! Look, you said it was lousy so I just —”
“I’m going to get started on some homework,” said Ron angrily
and stomped off to the staircase to the boys’ dormitories and vanished
from sight. Hermione turned to Harry.
“Was he lousy?”
“No,” said Harry loyally.
Hermione raised her eyebrows.
“Well, I suppose he could’ve played better,” Harry muttered, “but
it was only the first training session, like you said. . . .”
Neither Harry nor Ron seemed to make much headway with their
homework that night. Harry knew Ron was too preoccupied with
how badly he had performed at Quidditch practice and he himself
was having difficulty in getting the chant of “Gryffindor are losers” out
of his head.
They spent the whole of Sunday in the common room, buried in

294
PERCY AND PADFOOT
their books while the room around them filled up, then emptied: It
was another clear, fine day and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent
the day out in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the
last sunshine that year. By the evening Harry felt as though somebody
had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull.
“You know, we probably should try and get more homework done
during the week,” Harry muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside
Professor McGonagall’s long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell
and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra’s equally long and difficult
essay about Jupiter’s moons.
“Yeah,” said Ron, rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his
fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them. “Listen . . .
shall we just ask Hermione if we can have a look at what she’s done?”
Harry glanced over at her; she was sitting with Crookshanks on her
lap and chatting merrily to Ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed
in midair in front of her, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks.
“No,” he said heavily, “you know she won’t let us.”
And so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became
steadily darker; slowly, the crowd in the common room began to thin
again. At half-past eleven, Hermione wandered over to them,
yawning.
“Nearly done?”
“No,” said Ron shortly.
“Jupiter’s biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,” she said,
pointing over Ron’s shoulder at a line in his Astronomy essay, “and it’s
Io that’s got the volcanos.”
“Thanks,” snarled Ron, scratching out the offending sentences.
“Sorry, I only —”
“Yeah, well, if you’ve just come over here to criticize —”
“Ron —”
“I haven’t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I’m
up to my neck in it here —”

295
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
“No — look!”
Hermione was pointing to the nearest window. Harry and Ron
both looked over. A handsome screech owl was standing on the win-
dowsill, gazing into the room at Ron.
“Isn’t that Hermes?” said Hermione, sounding amazed.
“Blimey, it is!” said Ron quietly, throwing down his quill and get-
ting to his feet. “What’s Percy writing to me for?”
He crossed to the window and opened it; Hermes flew inside,
landed upon Ron’s essay, and held out a leg to which a letter was at-
tached. Ron took it off and the owl departed at once, leaving inky
footprints across Ron’s drawing of the moon Io.
“That’s definitely Percy’s handwriting,” said Ron, sinking back into
his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll: To
Ronald Weasley, Gryffindor House, Hogwarts. He looked up at the other
two. “What d’you reckon?”
“Open it!” said Hermione eagerly. Harry nodded.
Ron unrolled the scroll and began to read. The farther down the
parchment his eyes traveled, the more pronounced became his scowl.
When he had finished reading, he looked disgusted. He thrust the let-
ter at Harry and Hermione, who leaned toward each other to read it
together:
Dear Ron,
I have only just heard (from no less a person than the Minister
of Magic himself, who has it from your new teacher, Professor
Umbridge) that you have become a Hogwarts prefect.
I was most pleasantly surprised when I heard this news and
must firstly offer my congratulations. I must admit that I have al-
ways been afraid that you would take what we might call the
“Fred and George” route, rather than following in my footsteps, so
you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting
authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility.

296
PERCY AND PADFOOT
But I want to give you more than congratulations, Ron, I
want to give you some advice, which is why I am sending this at
night rather than by the usual morning post. Hopefully you will
be able to read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward
questions.
From something the Minister let slip when telling me you are
now a prefect, I gather that you are still seeing a lot of Harry Pot-
ter. I must tell you, Ron, that nothing could put you in danger of
losing your badge more than continued fraternization with that
boy. Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear this — no doubt you
will say that Potter has always been Dumbledore’s favorite — but
I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at
Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very dif-
ferent — and probably more accurate — view of Potters behav-
ior. I shall say no more here, but if you look at the Daily Prophet
tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blow-
ing — and see if you can spot yours truly!
Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same
brush as Potter, it could be very damaging to your future
prospects, and I am talking here about life after school too. As you
must be aware, given that our father escorted him to court, Pot-
ter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole
Wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good. He
got off on a mere technicality if you ask me and many of the peo-
ple I’ve spoken to remain convinced of his guilt.
It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter — I
know that he can be unbalanced and, for all I know, violent —
but if you have any worries about this, or have spotted anything
else in Potter’s behavior that is troubling you, I urge you to speak
to Dolores Umbridge, a really delightful woman, who I know
will be only too happy to advise you.
This leads me to my other bit of advice. As I have hinted

297
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
above, Dumbledore’s regime at Hogwarts may soon be over. Your
loyalty, Ron, should be not to him, but to the school and the Min-
istry. I am very sorry to hear that so far Professor Umbridge is en-
countering very little cooperation from staff as she strives to make
those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the Ministry so ar-
dently desires (although she should find this easier from next
week — again, see the Prophet tomorrow!). I shall say only this
— a student who shows himself willing to help Professor Um-
bridge now may be very well placed for Head Boyship in a couple
of years!
I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the sum-
mer. It pains me to criticize our parents, but I am afraid I can no
longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the
dangerous crowd around Dumbledore (if you are writing to
Mother at any point, you might tell her that a certain Sturgis
Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledore’s, has recently been
sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry. Perhaps that will
open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom they are
currently rubbing shoulders). I count myself very lucky to have es-
caped the stigma of association with such people — the Minister
really could not be more gracious to me — and I do hope, Ron,
that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided
nature of our parents’ beliefs and actions either. I sincerely hope
that, in time, they will realize how mistaken they were and I
shall, of course, be ready to accept a full apology when that day
comes.
Please think over what I have said most carefully, particularly
the bit about Harry Potter, and congratulations again on becom-
ing prefect.
Your brother,


Harry looked up at Ron.
“Well,” he said, trying to sound as though he found the whole
thing a joke, “if you want to — er — what is it?” (He checked Percy’s
letter.) “Oh yeah — ‘sever ties’ with me, I swear I won’t get violent.”
“Give it back,” said Ron, holding out his hand. “He is —” Ron said
jerkily, tearing Percy’s letter in half, “the world’s” — he tore it into
quarters — “biggest” — he tore it into eighths — “git.” He threw the
pieces into the fire.
“Come on, we’ve got to get this finished some time before dawn,”
he said briskly to Harry, pulling Professor Sinistra’s essay back toward
him.
Hermione was looking at Ron with an odd expression on her face.
“Oh, give them here,” she said abruptly.
“What?” said Ron.
“Give them to me, I’ll look through them and correct them,” she
said.
“Are you serious? Ah, Hermione, you’re a lifesaver,” said Ron,
“what can I — ?”
“What you can say is, ‘We promise we’ll never leave our homework
this late again,’ ” she said, holding out both hands for their essays, but
she looked slightly amused all the same.
“Thanks a million, Hermione,” said Harry weakly, passing over his
essay and sinking back into his armchair, rubbing his eyes.
It was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but
for the three of them and Crookshanks. The only sound was that of
Hermione’s quill scratching out sentences here and there on their
essays and the ruffle of pages as she checked various facts in the refer-
ence books strewn across the table. Harry was exhausted. He also felt
an odd, sick, empty feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do
with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling
blackly in the heart of the fire.
He knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought him

299
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
strange, even mad; he knew that the Daily Prophet had been making
snide allusions to him for months, but there was something about see-
ing it written down like that in Percy’s writing, about knowing that
Percy was advising Ron to drop him and even to tell tales on him to
Umbridge, that made his situation real to him as nothing else had. He
had known Percy for four years, had stayed in his house during the
summers, shared a tent with him during the Quidditch World Cup,
had even been awarded full marks by him in the second task of the
Triwizard Tournament last year, yet now, Percy thought him unbal-
anced and possibly violent.
And with a surge of sympathy for his godfather, Harry thought that
Sirius was probably the only person he knew who could really under-
stand how he felt at the moment, because Sirius was in the same situ-
ation; nearly everyone in the Wizarding world thought Sirius a
dangerous murderer and a great Voldemort supporter and he had had
to live with that knowledge for fourteen years. . . .
Harry blinked. He had just seen something in the fire that could
not have been there. It had flashed into sight and vanished immedi-
ately. No . . . it could not have been. . . . He had imagined it because
he had been thinking about Sirius. . . .
“Okay, write that down,” Hermione said to Ron, pushing his essay
and a sheet covered in her own writing back to Ron, “and then copy
out this conclusion that I’ve written for you.”
“Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I’ve ever
met,” said Ron weakly, “and if I’m ever rude to you again —”
“— I’ll know you’re back to normal,” said Hermione. “Harry,
yours is okay except for this bit at the end, I think you must have mis-
heard Professor Sinistra, Europa’s covered in ice, not mice — Harry?”
Harry had slid off his chair onto his knees and was now crouching
on the singed and threadbare hearthrug, gazing into the flames.
“Er — Harry?” said Ron uncertainly. “Why are you down there?”
“Because I’ve just seen Sirius’s head in the fire,” said Harry.

300
PERCY AND PADFOOT
He spoke quite calmly; after all, he had seen Sirius’s head in this
very fire the previous year and talked to it too. Nevertheless, he could
not be sure that he had really seen it this time. . . . It had vanished so
quickly. . . .
“Sirius’s head?” Hermione repeated. “You mean like when he
wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament? But he
wouldn’t do that now, it would be too — Sirius!”
She gasped, gazing at the fire; Ron dropped his quill. There in the
middle of the dancing flames sat Sirius’s head, long dark hair falling
around his grinning face.
“I was starting to think you’d go to bed before everyone else had
disappeared,” he said. “I’ve been checking every hour.”
“You’ve been popping into the fire every hour?” Harry said, half
laughing.
“Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear yet.”
“But what if you’d been seen?” said Hermione anxiously.
“Well, I think a girl — first year by the look of her — might’ve got
a glimpse of me earlier, but don’t worry,” Sirius said hastily, as
Hermione clapped a hand to her mouth. “I was gone the moment she
looked back at me and I’ll bet she just thought I was an oddly shaped
log or something.”
“But Sirius, this is taking an awful risk —” Hermione began.
“You sound like Molly,” said Sirius. “This was the only way I could
come up with of answering Harry’s letter without resorting to a
code — and codes are breakable.”
At the mention of Harry’s letter, Hermione and Ron had both
turned to stare at him.
“You didn’t say you’d written to Sirius!” said Hermione accusingly.
“I forgot,” said Harry, which was perfectly true; his meeting with
Cho in the Owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind.
“Don’t look at me like that, Hermione, there was no way anyone
would have got secret information out of it, was there, Sirius?”

301
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
“No, it was very good,” said Sirius, smiling. “Anyway, we’d better
be quick, just in case we’re disturbed — your scar.”
“What about — ?” Ron began, but Hermione said quickly, “We’ll
tell you afterward, go on, Sirius.”
“Well, I know it can’t be fun when it hurts, but we don’t think it’s
anything to really worry about. It kept aching all last year, didn’t it?”
“Yeah, and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was
feeling a powerful emotion,” said Harry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and
Hermione’s winces. “So maybe he was just, I dunno, really angry or
something the night I had that detention.”
“Well, now he’s back it’s bound to hurt more often,” said Sirius.
“So you don’t think it had anything to do with Umbridge touching
me when I was in detention with her?” Harry asked.
“I doubt it,” said Sirius. “I know her by reputation and I’m sure
she’s no Death Eater —”
“She’s foul enough to be one,” said Harry darkly and Ron and
Hermione nodded vigorously in agreement.
“Yes, but the world isn’t split into good people and Death Eaters,”
said Sirius with a wry smile. “I know she’s a nasty piece of work,
though — you should hear Remus talk about her.”
“Does Lupin know her?” asked Harry quickly, remembering Um-
bridge’s comments about dangerous half-breeds during her first
lesson.
“No,” said Sirius, “but she drafted a bit of anti-werewolf legislation
two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job.”
Harry remembered how much shabbier Lupin looked these days
and his dislike of Umbridge deepened even further.
“What’s she got against werewolves?” said Hermione angrily.
“Scared of them, I expect,” said Sirius, smiling at her indignation.
“Apparently she loathes part-humans; she campaigned to have mer-
people rounded up and tagged last year too. Imagine wasting your

302
PERCY AND PADFOOT
time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags
like Kreacher on the loose —”
Ron laughed but Hermione looked upset.
“Sirius!” she said reproachfully. “Honestly, if you made a bit of an ef-
fort with Kreacher I’m sure he’d respond, after all, you are the only
member of his family he’s got left, and Professor Dumbledore said —”
“So what are Umbridge’s lessons like?” Sirius interrupted. “Is she
training you all to kill half-breeds?”
“No,” said Harry, ignoring Hermione’s affronted look at being cut
off in her defense of Kreacher. “She’s not letting us use magic at all!”
“All we do is read the stupid textbook,” said Ron.
“Ah, well, that figures,” said Sirius. “Our information from inside
the Ministry is that Fudge doesn’t want you trained in combat.”
“Trained in combat?” repeated Harry incredulously. “What does he
think we’re doing here, forming some sort of wizard army?”
“That’s exactly what he thinks you’re doing,” said Sirius, “or rather,
that’s exactly what he’s afraid Dumbledore’s doing — forming his
own private army, with which he will be able to take on the Ministry
of Magic.”
There was a pause at this, then Ron said, “That’s the stupidest
thing I’ve ever heard, including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood
comes out with.”
“So we’re being prevented from learning Defense Against the Dark
Arts because Fudge is scared we’ll use spells against the Ministry?” said
Hermione, looking furious.
“Yep,” said Sirius. “Fudge thinks Dumbledore will stop at nothing
to seize power. He’s getting more paranoid about Dumbledore by the
day. It’s a matter of time before he has Dumbledore arrested on some
trumped-up charge.”
This reminded Harry of Percy’s letter.
“D’you know if there’s going to be anything about Dumbledore in

303
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
the Daily Prophet tomorrow? Only Ron’s brother Percy reckons there
will be —”
“I don’t know,” said Sirius, “I haven’t seen anyone from the Order
all weekend, they’re all busy. It’s just been Kreacher and me here. . . .”
There was a definite note of bitterness in Sirius’s voice.
“So you haven’t had any news about Hagrid, either?”
“Ah . . .” said Sirius, “well, he was supposed to be back by now, no
one’s sure what’s happened to him.” Then, seeing their stricken faces,
he added quickly, “But Dumbledore’s not worried, so don’t you three
get yourselves in a state; I’m sure Hagrid’s fine.”
“But if he was supposed to be back by now . . .” said Hermione in
a small, worried voice.
“Madame Maxime was with him, we’ve been in touch with her and
she says they got separated on the journey home — but there’s noth-
ing to suggest he’s hurt or — well, nothing to suggest he’s not perfectly
okay.”
Unconvinced, Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged worried
looks.
“Listen, don’t go asking too many questions about Hagrid,” said
Sirius hastily, “it’ll just draw even more attention to the fact that he’s
not back, and I know Dumbledore doesn’t want that. Hagrid’s tough,
he’ll be okay.” And when they did not appear cheered by this, Sirius
added, “When’s your next Hogsmeade weekend anyway? I was think-
ing, we got away with the dog disguise at the station, didn’t we? I
thought I could —”
“NO!” said Harry and Hermione together, very loudly.
“Sirius, didn’t you see the Daily Prophet?” said Hermione anxiously.
“Oh that,” said Sirius, grinning, “they’re always guessing where I
am, they haven’t really got a clue —”
“Yeah, but we think this time they have,” said Harry. “Something
Malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you, and his fa-
ther was on the platform, Sirius — you know, Lucius Malfoy — so


PERCY AND PADFOOT
don’t come up here, whatever you do, if Malfoy recognizes you
again —”
“All right, all right, I’ve got the point,” said Sirius. He looked most
displeased. “Just an idea, thought you might like to get together —”
“I would, I just don’t want you chucked back in Azkaban!” said
Harry.
There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry, a
crease between his sunken eyes.
“You’re less like your father than I thought,” he said finally, a defi-
nite coolness in his voice. “The risk would’ve been what made it fun
for James.”
“Look —”
“Well, I’d better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the
stairs,” said Sirius, but Harry was sure he was lying. “I’ll write to tell
you a time I can make it back into the fire, then, shall I? If you can
stand to risk it?”
There was a tiny pop, and the place where Sirius’s head had been
was flickering flame once more.

hey had expected to have to comb Hermione’s Daily Prophet
carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned
in his letter. However, the departing delivery owl had barely cleared
the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flat-
tened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores Um-
bridge, smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the
headline:
MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM
DOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTED FIRST-EVER “HIGH INQUISITOR”
“ ‘High Inquisitor’?” said Harry darkly, his half-eaten bit of toast
slipping from his fingers. “What does that mean?”
Hermione read aloud:
“In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legis-
lation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry.
“ ‘The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings-on at Hogwarts

306
THE HOGWARTS
HIGH INQUISITOR
for some time,’ said Junior Assistant to the Minister, Percy Weasley. ‘He is
now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents, who feel the school
may be moving in a direction they do not approve.’
“This is not the first time in recent weeks Fudge has used new laws to
effect improvements at the Wizarding school. As recently as August 30th
Educational Decree Twenty-two was passed, to ensure that, in the event of
the current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching
post, the Ministry should select an appropriate person.
“ ‘That’s how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching
staff at Hogwarts,’ said Weasley last night. ‘Dumbledore couldn’t find any-
one, so the Minister put in Umbridge and of course, she’s been an imme-
diate success —’ ”
“She’s been a WHAT?” said Harry loudly.
“Wait, there’s more,” said Hermione grimly.
“ ‘— an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the teaching of
Defense Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with on-the-
ground feedback about what’s really happening at Hogwarts.’
“It is this last function that the Ministry has now formalized with the
passing of Educational Decree Twenty-three, which creates the new posi-
tion of ‘Hogwarts High Inquisitor.’
“ ‘This is an exciting new phase in the Minister’s plan to get to grips
with what some are calling the “falling standards” at Hogwarts,’ said
Weasley. ‘The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators
and make sure that they are coming up to scratch. Professor Umbridge has
been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post, and we are
delighted to say that she has accepted.’
“The Ministry’s new moves have received enthusiastic support from
parents of students at Hogwarts.
“ ‘I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that Dumbledore is
being subjected to fair and objective evaluation,’ said Mr. Lucius Malfoy,
41, speaking from his Wiltshire mansion last night. ‘Many of us with our
children’s best interests at heart have been concerned about some of

307
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Dumbledore’s eccentric decisions in the last few years and will be glad to
know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation.’
“Among those ‘eccentric decisions’ are undoubtedly the controversial
staff appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have in-
cluded the hiring of werewolf Remus Lupin, half giant Rubeus Hagrid,
and delusional ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief
Warlock of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the
prestigious school of Hogwarts.
“ ‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensur-
ing that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’
said a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have
resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.
“ ‘Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge’s office,’ said
Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Al-
bus Dumbledore.’ (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks’ alleged
links to subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17).”
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other
two.
“So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge! Fudge passed
this ‘Educational Decree’ and forced her on us! And now he’s given
her the power to inspect other teachers!” Hermione was breathing fast
and her eyes were very bright. “I can’t believe this. It’s outrageous. . . .”
“I know it is,” said Harry. He looked down at his right hand,
clenched upon the tabletop, and saw the faint white outline of the
words Umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin.
But a grin was unfurling on Ron’s face.
“What?” said Harry and Hermione together, staring at him.
“Oh, I can’t wait to see McGonagall inspected,” said Ron happily.
“Umbridge won’t know what’s hit her.”

308
THE HOGWARTS
HIGH INQUISITOR
“Well, come on,” said Hermione, jumping up, “we’d better get go-
ing, if she’s inspecting Binns’s class we don’t want to be late. . . .”
But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic
lesson, which was just as dull as the previous Monday, nor was she in
Snape’s dungeon when they arrived for double Potions, where Harry’s
moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large, spiky black D
scrawled in an upper corner.
“I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you pre-
sented this work in your O.W.L,” said Snape with a smirk, as he swept
among them, passing back their homework. “This should give you a
realistic idea of what to expect in your examination.”
Snape reached the front of the class and turned to face them.
“The general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you
would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a
great deal more effort for this week’s essay on the various varieties of
venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to
those dunces who get D’s.”
He smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper,
“Some people got D’s? Ha!”
Harry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to see what
grade he had received; he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as
quickly as possible, feeling that he would rather keep that information
private.
Determined not to give Snape an excuse to fail him this lesson,
Harry read and reread every line of the instructions on the blackboard
at least three times before acting on them. His Strengthening Solution
was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermione’s but it was at
least blue rather than pink, like Neville’s, and he delivered a flask of it
to Snape’s desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defi-
ance and relief.
“Well, that wasn’t as bad as last week, was it?” said Hermione, as
they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across

309
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
the entrance hall toward lunch. “And the homework didn’t go too
badly either, did it?”
When neither Ron nor Harry answered, she pressed on, “I mean,
all right, I didn’t expect the top grade, not if he’s marking to O.W.L.
standard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn’t you
say?”
Harry made a noncommittal noise in his throat.
“Of course, a lot can happen between now and the exam, we’ve got
plenty of time to improve, but the grades we’re getting now are a sort
of baseline, aren’t they? Something we can build on . . .”
They sat down together at the Gryffindor table.
“Obviously, I’d have been thrilled if I’d gotten an O —”
“Hermione,” said Ron sharply, “if you want to know what grades
we got, ask.”
“I don’t — I didn’t mean — well, if you want to tell me —”
“I got a P,” said Ron, ladling soup into his bowl. “Happy?”
“Well, that’s nothing to be ashamed of,” said Fred, who had just ar-
rived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on
Harry’s right. “Nothing wrong with a good healthy P.”
“But,” said Hermione, “doesn’t P stand for . . .”
“ ‘Poor,’ yeah,” said Lee Jordan. “Still, better than D, isn’t it?
‘Dreadful’?”
Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over
his roll. When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that
Hermione was still in full flow about O.W.L. grades.
“So top grade’s O for ‘Outstanding,’ ” she was saying, “and then
there’s A —”
“No, E,” George corrected her, “E for ‘Exceeds Expectations.’ And
I’ve always thought Fred and I should’ve got E in everything, because
we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams.”
They all laughed except Hermione, who plowed on, “So after E, it’s
A for ‘Acceptable,’ and that’s the last pass grade, isn’t it?”

310
THE HOGWARTS
HIGH INQUISITOR
“Yep,” said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his soup, transferring it
to his mouth, and swallowing it whole.
“Then you get P for ‘Poor’ ” — Ron raised both his arms in mock
celebration — “and D for ‘Dreadful.’ ”
“And then T,” George reminded him.
“T?” asked Hermione, looking appalled. “Even lower than a D?
What on earth does that stand for?”
“ ‘Troll,’ ” said George promptly.
Harry laughed again, though he was not sure whether or not
George was joking. He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione
that he had received T’s in all his O.W.L.s and immediately resolved
to work harder from now on.
“You lot had an inspected lesson yet?” Fred asked them.
“No,” said Hermione at once, “have you?”
“Just now, before lunch,” said George. “Charms.”
“What was it like?” Harry and Hermione asked together.
Fred shrugged.
“Not that bad. Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on
a clipboard. You know what Flitwick’s like, he treated her like a guest,
didn’t seem to bother him at all. She didn’t say much. Asked Alicia a
couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Alicia
told her they were really good, that was it.”
“I can’t see old Flitwick getting marked down,” said George, “he
usually gets everyone through their exams all right.”
“Who’ve you got this afternoon?” Fred asked Harry.
“Trelawney —”
“A T if ever I saw one —”
“— and Umbridge herself.”
“Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today,”
said George. “Angelina’ll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch
practices.”
But Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts

311
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
to meet Professor Umbridge. He was pulling out his dream diary in a
seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron el-
bowed him in the ribs and, looking round, he saw Professor Umbridge
emerging through the trapdoor in the floor. The class, which had been
talking cheerily, fell silent at once. The abrupt fall in the noise level
made Professor Trelawney, who had been wafting about handing out
Dream Oracles, look round.
“Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,” said Professor Umbridge
with her wide smile. “You received my note, I trust? Giving the time
and date of your inspection?”
Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very disgruntled,
turned her back on Professor Umbridge and continued to give out
books. Still smiling, Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the near-
est armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few
inches behind Professor Trelawney’s seat. She then sat down, took her
clipboard from her flowery bag, and looked up expectantly, waiting
for the class to begin.
Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly
trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnify-
ing lenses. “We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams to-
day,” she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her
voice shook slightly. “Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each
other’s latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle.”
She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Um-
bridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left toward Par-
vati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati’s
most recent dream.
Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge
covertly. She was making notes on her clipboard now. After a few min-
utes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawney’s
wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing ques-
tions here and there. Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book.


THE HOGWARTS
HIGH INQUISITOR
“Think of a dream, quick,” he told Ron, “in case the old toad
comes our way.”
“I did it last time,” Ron protested, “it’s your turn, you tell me one.”
“Oh, I dunno . . .” said Harry desperately, who could not remem-
ber dreaming anything at all over the last few days. “Let’s say I dreamed
I was . . . drowning Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, that’ll do. . . .”
Ron chortled as he opened his Dream Oracle.
“Okay, we’ve got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the
number of letters in the subject . . . would that be ‘drowning’ or ‘caul-
dron’ or ‘Snape’?”
“It doesn’t matter, pick any of them,” said Harry, chancing a glance
behind him. Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Tre-
lawney’s shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher ques-
tioned Neville about his dream diary.
“What night did you dream this again?” Ron said, immersed in
calculations.
“I dunno, last night, whenever you like,” Harry told him, trying to
listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney. They were
only a table away from him and Ron now. Professor Umbridge was
making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was
looking extremely put out.
“Now,” said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, “you’ve been in
this post how long, exactly?”
Professor Trelawney scowled at her, arms crossed and shoulders
hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible
from the indignity of the inspection. After a slight pause in which she
seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could
reasonably ignore it, she said in a deeply resentful tone, “Nearly six-
teen years.”
“Quite a period,” said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her
clipboard. “So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?”
“That’s right,” said Professor Trelawney shortly.

313
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Professor Umbridge made another note.
“And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer
Cassandra Trelawney?”
“Yes,” said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher.
Another note on the clipboard.
“But I think — correct me if I am mistaken — that you are the
first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight?”
“These things often skip — er — three generations,” said Professor
Trelawney.
Professor Umbridge’s toadlike smile widened.
“Of course,” she said sweetly, making yet another note. “Well, if
you could just predict something for me, then?”
She looked up inquiringly, still smiling. Professor Trelawney had
stiffened as though unable to believe her ears.
“I don’t understand you,” said Professor Trelawney, clutching con-
vulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck.
“I’d like you to make a prediction for me,” said Professor Umbridge
very clearly.
Harry and Ron were not the only people watching and listening
sneakily from behind their books now; most of the class were staring
transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew herself up to her full
height, her beads and bangles clinking.
“The Inner Eye does not See upon command!” she said in scandal-
ized tones.
“I see,” said Professor Umbridge softly, making yet another note on
her clipboard.
“I — but — but . . . wait!” said Professor Trelawney suddenly, in
an attempt at her usual ethereal voice, though the mystical effect was
ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger. “I . . . I think
I do see something . . . something that concerns you. . . . Why, I sense
something . . . something dark . . . some grave peril . . .”

314
THE HOGWARTS
HIGH INQUISITOR
Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Um-
bridge who continued to smile blandly at her, eyebrows raised.
“I am afraid . . . I am afraid that you are in grave danger!” Professor
Trelawney finished dramatically.
There was a pause. Professor Umbridge’s eyebrows were still raised.
“Right,” she said softly, scribbling on her clipboard once more.
“Well, if that’s really the best you can do . . .”
She turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted
to the spot, her chest heaving. Harry caught Ron’s eye and knew that
Ron was thinking exactly the same as he was: They both knew
that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the other hand,
they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Tre-
lawney’s side — until she swooped down on them a few seconds
later, that was.
“Well?” she said, snapping her long fingers under Harry’s nose, un-
characteristically brisk. “Let me see the start you’ve made on your
dream diary, please.”
And by the time she had interpreted Harry’s dreams at the top of
her voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge,
apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), he was feeling much
less sympathetic toward her. All the while, Professor Umbridge stood
a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell
rang she descended the silver ladder first so that she was waiting for
them all when they reached their Defense Against the Dark Arts les-
son ten minutes later.
She was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the
room. Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy,
exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their
copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could ask
any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and si-
lence fell.

315
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
“Wands away,” she instructed them all smilingly, and those people
who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to
their bags. “As we finished chapter one last lesson, I would like you all to
turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two, ‘Common De-
fensive Theories and Their Derivation.’ There will be no need to talk.”
Still smiling her wide, self-satisfied smile, she sat down at her desk.
The class gave an audible sigh as it turned, as one, to page nineteen.
Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the
book to keep them reading through all this year’s lessons and was on
the point of checking the contents when he noticed that Hermione
had her hand in the air again.
Professor Umbridge had noticed too, and what was more, she
seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality. In-
stead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione, she got to
her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were
face-to-face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the
class could not hear, “What is it this time, Miss Granger?”
“I’ve already read chapter two,” said Hermione.
“Well then, proceed to chapter three.”
“I’ve read that too. I’ve read the whole book.”
Professor Umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost
instantly.
“Well, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says
about counterjinxes in chapter fifteen.”
“He says that counterjinxes are improperly named,” said Hermione
promptly. “He says ‘counterjinx’ is just a name people give their jinxes
when they want to make them sound more acceptable.”
Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows, and Harry knew she was
impressed against her will.
“But I disagree,” Hermione continued.
Professor Umbridge’s eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze be-
came distinctly colder.

316
THE HOGWARTS
HIGH INQUISITOR
“You disagree?”
“Yes, I do,” said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whis-
pering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted
the rest of the class’s attention. “Mr. Slinkhard doesn’t like jinxes, does
he? But I think they can be very useful when they’re used defensively.”
“Oh, you do, do you?” said Professor Umbridge, forgetting to
whisper and straightening up. “Well, I’m afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard’s
opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss
Granger.”
“But —” Hermione began.
“That is enough,” said Professor Umbridge. She walked back to the
front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness she had
shown at the beginning of the lesson gone. “Miss Granger, I am going
to take five points from Gryffindor House.”
There was an outbreak of muttering at this.
“What for?” said Harry angrily.
“Don’t you get involved!” Hermione whispered urgently to him.
“For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,” said Profes-
sor Umbridge smoothly. “I am here to teach you using a Ministry-
approved method that does not include inviting students to give their
opinions on matters about which they understand very little. Your pre-
vious teachers in this subject may have allowed you more license, but
as none of them — with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell,
who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age-appropriate
subjects — would have passed a Ministry inspection —”
“Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,” said Harry loudly, “there was
just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out
of the back of his head.”
This pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences
Harry had ever heard. Then —
“I think another week’s detentions would do you some good, Mr.
Potter,” said Umbridge sleekly.

317
CHAPTER FIFTEEN


The cut on the back of Harry’s hand had barely healed and by the
following morning, it was bleeding again. He did not complain dur-
ing the evening’s detention; he was determined not to give Umbridge
the satisfaction; over and over again he wrote I must not tell lies and not
a sound escaped his lips, though the cut deepened with every letter.
The very worst part of this second week’s worth of detentions was,
just as George had predicted, Angelina’s reaction. She cornered him
just as he arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on Tuesday and
shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down
upon the pair of them from the staff table.
“Miss Johnson, how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall!
Five points from Gryffindor!”
“But Professor — he’s gone and landed himself in detention
again —”
“What’s this, Potter?” said Professor McGonagall sharply, rounding
on Harry. “Detention? From whom?”
“From Professor Umbridge,” muttered Harry, not meeting Profes-
sor McGonagall’s beady, square-framed eyes.
“Are you telling me,” she said, lowering her voice so that the group
of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear, “that after the
warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor
Umbridge’s class again?”
“Yes,” Harry muttered, speaking to the floor.
“Potter, you must get a grip on yourself! You are heading for seri-
ous trouble! Another five points from Gryffindor!”
“But — what? Professor, no!” Harry said, furious at this injustice.
“I’m already being punished by her, why do you have to take points as
well?”
“Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you what-

318
THE HOGWARTS
HIGH INQUISITOR
soever!” said Professor McGonagall tartly. “No, not another word of
complaint, Potter! And as for you, Miss Johnson, you will confine
your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing
the team Captaincy!”
She strode back toward the staff table. Angelina gave Harry a look
of deepest disgust and stalked away, upon which Harry flung himself
onto the bench beside Ron, fuming.
“She’s taken points off Gryffindor because I’m having my hand
sliced open every night! How is that fair, how?”
“I know, mate,” said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon onto
Harry’s plate, “she’s bang out of order.”
Hermione, however, merely rustled the pages of her Daily Prophet
and said nothing.
“You think McGonagall was right, do you?” said Harry angrily to
the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring Hermione’s face.
“I wish she hadn’t taken points from you, but I think she’s right to
warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge,” said Hermione’s
voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly
giving some kind of speech.
Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, but when
they entered Transfiguration he forgot his anger; Professor Umbridge
and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove
the memory of breakfast right out of his head.
“Excellent,” whispered Ron, as they sat down in their usual seats.
“Let’s see Umbridge get what she deserves.”
Professor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the
slightest indication that she knew Professor Umbridge was there.
“That will do,” she said and silence fell immediately. “Mr. Finni-
gan, kindly come here and hand back the homework — Miss Brown,
please take this box of mice — don’t be silly, girl, they won’t hurt
you — and hand one to each student —”

319
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
“Hem, hem,” said Professor Umbridge, employing the same silly
little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night
of term. Professor McGonagall ignored her. Seamus handed back
Harry’s essay; Harry took it without looking at him and saw, to his
relief, that he had managed an A.
“Right then, everyone, listen closely — Dean Thomas, if you do
that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention — most of you
have now successfully vanished your snails and even those who were
left with a certain amount of shell have the gist of the spell. Today we
shall be —”
“Hem, hem,” said Professor Umbridge.
“Yes?” said Professor McGonagall, turning round, her eyebrows so
close together they seemed to form one long, severe line.
“I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note
telling you of the date and time of your inspec —”
“Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are
doing in my classroom,” said Professor McGonagall, turning her back
firmly on Professor Umbridge. Many of the students exchanged looks
of glee. “As I was saying, today we shall be practicing the altogether
more difficult vanishment of mice. Now, the Vanishing Spell —”
“Hem, hem.”
“I wonder,” said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on
Professor Umbridge, “how you expect to gain an idea of my usual
teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not
generally permit people to talk when I am talking.”
Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in
the face. She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her
clipboard and began scribbling furiously. Looking supremely uncon-
cerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more.
“As I was saying, the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with
the complexity of the animal to be vanished. The snail, as an inverte-
brate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal,


offers a much greater one. This is not, therefore, magic you can accom-
plish with your mind on your dinner. So — you know the incantation,
let me see what you can do. . . .”
“How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with
Umbridge!” Harry said to Ron under his voice, but he was grinning;
his anger with Professor McGonagall had quite evaporated.
Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around
the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she thought
that Professor McGonagall would not permit it. She did, however,
take many more notes while she sat in her corner, and when Professor
McGonagall finally told them all to pack away, rose with a grim ex-
pression on her face.
“Well, it’s a start,” said Ron, holding up a long, wriggling mouse
tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around.
As they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw Professor Umbridge
approach the teacher’s desk; he nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione
in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop.
“How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?” Professor Um-
bridge asked.
“Thirty-nine years this December,” said Professor McGonagall
brusquely, snapping her bag shut.
Professor Umbridge made a note.
“Very well,” she said, “you will receive the results of your inspection
in ten days’ time.”
“I can hardly wait,” said Professor McGonagall in a coldly indiffer-
ent voice, and she strode off toward the door. “Hurry up, you three,”
she added, sweeping Harry, Ron, and Hermione before her. Harry
could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he re-
ceived one in return.
He had thought that the next time he would see Umbridge would
be in his detention that evening, but he was wrong. When they walked
down the lawns toward the forest for Care of Magical Creatures, they


CHAPTER FIFTEEN
found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside Professor
Grubbly-Plank.
“You do not usually take this class, is that correct?” Harry heard her
ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive
bowtruckles were scrabbling around for wood lice like so many living
twigs.
“Quite correct,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her
back and bouncing on the balls of her feet. “I am a substitute teacher
standing in for Professor Hagrid.”
Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione. Malfoy
was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; he would surely love this op-
portunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry.
“Hmm,” said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, though
Harry could still hear her quite clearly, “I wonder — the headmaster
seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter —
can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid’s very extended leave
of absence?”
Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly.
“ ’Fraid I can’t,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank breezily. “Don’t
know anything more about it than you do. Got an owl from Dumble-
dore, would I like a couple of weeks teaching work, accepted — that’s
as much as I know. Well . . . shall I get started then?”
“Yes, please do,” said Professor Umbridge, scribbling upon her
clipboard.
Umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered among
the students, questioning them on magical creatures. Most people
were able to answer well and Harry’s spirits lifted somewhat; at least
the class was not letting Hagrid down.
“Overall,” said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor Grubbly-
Plank’s side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, “how do
you, as a temporary member of staff — an objective outsider, I suppose

322
THE HOGWARTS
HIGH INQUISITOR
you might say — how do you find Hogwarts? Do you feel you receive
enough support from the school management?”
“Oh, yes, Dumbledore’s excellent,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank
heartily. “No, I’m very happy with the way things are run, very happy
indeed.”
Looking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny note on her
clipboard and went on, “And what are you planning to cover with this
class this year — assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not
return?”
“Oh, I’ll take them through the creatures that most often come up
in O.W.L.,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank. “Not much left to do —
they’ve studied unicorns and nifflers, I thought we’d cover porlocks and
kneazles, make sure they can recognize crups and knarls, you know. . . .”
“Well, you seem to know what you’re doing, at any rate,” said Pro-
fessor Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard. Harry
did not like the emphasis she put on “you” and liked it even less when
she put her next question to Goyle: “Now, I hear there have been in-
juries in this class?”
Goyle gave a stupid grin. Malfoy hastened to answer the question.
“That was me,” he said. “I was slashed by a hippogriff.”
“A hippogriff?” said Professor Umbridge, now scribbling frantically.
“Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him
to do,” said Harry angrily.
Both Ron and Hermione groaned. Professor Umbridge turned her
head slowly in Harry’s direction.
“Another night’s detention, I think,” she said softly. “Well, thank
you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that’s all I need
here. You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten
days.”
“Jolly good,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Um-
bridge set off back across the lawn to the castle.

It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge’s office that night,
his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had
wrapped around it. He expected the common room to be empty when
he returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him. He
was pleased to see them, especially as Hermione was disposed to be
sympathetic rather than critical.
“Here,” she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid
toward him, “soak your hand in that, it’s a solution of strained and
pickled murtlap tentacles, it should help.”
Harry placed his bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experi-
enced a wonderful feeling of relief. Crookshanks curled around his
legs, purring loudly, and then leapt into his lap and settled down.
“Thanks,” he said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks’s ears
with his left hand.
“I still reckon you should complain about this,” said Ron in a low
voice.
“No,” said Harry flatly.
“McGonagall would go nuts if she knew —”
“Yeah, she probably would,” said Harry. “And how long d’you
reckon it’d take Umbridge to pass another Decree saying anyone who
complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?”
Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a
moment he closed it again in a defeated sort of way.
“She’s an awful woman,” said Hermione in a small voice. “Awful.
You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in . . . we’ve got to
do something about her.”
“I suggested poison,” said Ron grimly.
“No . . . I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is,
and how we’re not going to learn any defense from her at all,” said
Hermione.

324
THE HOGWARTS
HIGH INQUISITOR
“Well, what can we do about that?” said Ron, yawning. “ ’S too late,
isn’t it? She got the job, she’s here to stay, Fudge’ll make sure of that.”
“Well,” said Hermione tentatively. “You know, I was thinking to-
day. . . .” She shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on,
“I was thinking that — maybe the time’s come when we should just —
just do it ourselves.”
“Do what ourselves?” said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand
in the essence of murtlap tentacles.
“Well — learn Defense Against the Dark Arts ourselves,” said Her-
mione.
“Come off it,” groaned Ron. “You want us to do extra work? D’you
realize Harry and I are behind on homework again and it’s only the
second week?”
“But this is much more important than homework!” said Hermione.
Harry and Ron goggled at her.
“I didn’t think there was anything in the universe more important
than homework,” said Ron.
“Don’t be silly, of course there is!” said Hermione, and Harry saw,
with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the
kind of fervor that S.P.E.W. usually inspired in her. “It’s about prepar-
ing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge’s first lesson, for what’s
waiting out there. It’s about making sure we really can defend our-
selves. If we don’t learn anything for a whole year —”
“We can’t do much by ourselves,” said Ron in a defeated voice. “I
mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and
practice them, I suppose —”
“No, I agree, we’ve gone past the stage where we can just learn
things out of books,” said Hermione. “We need a teacher, a proper
one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we’re go-
ing wrong.”
“If you’re talking about Lupin . . .” Harry began.
“No, no, I’m not talking about Lupin,” said Hermione. “He’s too

325
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
busy with the Order and anyway, the most we could see him is during
Hogsmeade weekends and that’s not nearly often enough.”
“Who, then?” said Harry, frowning at her.
Hermione heaved a very deep sigh.
“Isn’t it obvious?” she said. “I’m talking about you, Harry.”
There was a moment’s silence. A light night breeze rattled the win-
dowpanes behind Ron and the fire guttered.
“About me what?” said Harry.
“I’m talking about you teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
Harry stared at her. Then he turned to Ron, ready to exchange the
exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated
on far-fetched schemes like S.P.E.W. To Harry’s consternation, how-
ever, Ron did not look exasperated. He was frowning slightly, appar-
ently thinking. Then he said, “That’s an idea.”
“What’s an idea?” said Harry.
“You,” said Ron. “Teaching us to do it.”
“But . . .”
Harry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his leg.
“But I’m not a teacher, I can’t —”
“Harry, you’re the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark
Arts,” said Hermione.
“Me?” said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. “No I’m
not, you’ve beaten me in every test —”
“Actually, I haven’t,” said Hermione coolly. “You beat me in our
third year — the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who
actually knew the subject. But I’m not talking about test results,
Harry. Look what you’ve done!”
“How d’you mean?”
“You know what, I’m not sure I want someone this stupid teaching
me,” Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned to Harry.
“Let’s think,” he said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. “Uh . . .
first year — you saved the Stone from You-Know-Who.”

326
THE HOGWARTS
HIGH INQUISITOR
“But that was luck,” said Harry, “that wasn’t skill —”
“Second year,” Ron interrupted, “you killed the basilisk and de-
stroyed Riddle.”
“Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn’t turned up I —”
“Third year,” said Ron, louder still, “you fought off about a hun-
dred dementors at once —”
“You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn’t —”
“Last year,” Ron said, almost shouting now, “you fought off You-
Know-Who again —”
“Listen to me!” said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and
Hermione were both smirking now. “Just listen to me, all right? It
sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck — I
didn’t know what I was doing half the time, I didn’t plan any of it, I
just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help —”
Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his temper
rise; he wasn’t even sure why he was feeling so angry.
“Don’t sit there grinning like you know better than I do, I was
there, wasn’t I?” he said heatedly. “I know what went on, all right? And
I didn’t get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defense
Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because — because help
came at the right time, or because I guessed right — but I just blun-
dered through it all, I didn’t have a clue what I was doing — STOP
LAUGHING!”
The bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed. He be-
came aware that he was on his feet, though he couldn’t remember
standing up. Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa; Ron and
Hermione’s smiles had vanished.
“You don’t know what it’s like! You — neither of you — you’ve never
had to face him, have you? You think it’s just memorizing a bunch of
spells and throwing them at him, like you’re in class or something?
The whole time you know there’s nothing between you and dying ex-
cept your own — your own brain or guts or whatever — like you can

327
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
think straight when you know you’re about a second from being mur-
dered, or tortured, or watching your friends die — they’ve never
taught us that in their classes, what it’s like to deal with things like
that — and you two sit there acting like I’m a clever little boy to be
standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up —
you just don’t get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would
have been if Voldemort hadn’t needed me —”
“We weren’t saying anything like that, mate,” said Ron, looking
aghast. “We weren’t having a go at Diggory, we didn’t — you’ve got
the wrong end of the —”
He looked helplessly at Hermione, whose face was stricken.
“Harry,” she said timidly, “don’t you see? This . . . this is exactly
why we need you. . . . We need to know what it’s r-really like . . . fac-
ing him . . . facing V-Voldemort.”
It was the first time she had ever said Voldemort’s name, and it was
this, more than anything else, that calmed Harry. Still breathing hard,
he sank back into his chair, becoming aware as he did so that his hand
was throbbing horribly again. He wished he had not smashed the
bowl of murtlap essence.
“Well . . . think about it,” said Hermione quietly. “Please?”
Harry could not think of anything to say. He was feeling ashamed
of his outburst already. He nodded, hardly aware of what he was
agreeing to.
Hermione stood up.
“Well, I’m off to bed,” she said in a voice that was clearly as natural
as she could make it. “Erm . . . ’night.”
Ron had gotten to his feet too.
“Coming?” he said awkwardly to Harry.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “In . . . in a minute. I’ll just clear this up.”
He indicated the smashed bowl on the floor. Ron nodded and left.
“Reparo,” Harry muttered, pointing his wand at the broken pieces


HIGH INQUISITOR
of china. They flew back together, good as new, but there was no re-
turning the murtlap essence to the bowl.
He was suddenly so tired that he was tempted to sink back into his
armchair and sleep there, but instead he got to his feet and followed
Ron upstairs. His restless night was punctuated once more by dreams
of long corridors and locked doors, and he awoke next day with his
scar prickling again.

IN THE HOG’S HEAD
H
ermione made no mention of Harry giving Defense Against
the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original
suggestion. Harry’s detentions with Umbridge were finally over (he
doubted whether the words now etched on the back of his hand
would ever fade entirely); Ron had had four more Quidditch practices
and not been shouted at during the last two; and all three of them had
managed to vanish their mice in Transfiguration (Hermione had actu-
ally progressed to vanishing kittens), before the subject was broached
again, on a wild, blustery evening at the end of September, when the
three of them were sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients
for Snape.
“I was wondering,” Hermione said suddenly, “whether you’d
thought any more about Defense Against the Dark Arts, Harry.”
“ ’Course I have,” said Harry grumpily. “Can’t forget it, can we,
with that hag teaching us —”
“I meant the idea Ron and I had” — Ron cast her an alarmed,
threatening kind of look; she frowned at him — “oh, all right, the
idea I had, then — about you teaching us.”

330
IN THE HOG’S HEAD
Harry did not answer at once. He pretended to be perusing a page
of Asiatic Anti-Venoms, because he did not want to say what was in his
mind.
The fact was that he had given the matter a great deal of thought
over the past fortnight. Sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it
had on the night Hermione had proposed it, but at others, he had
found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his
various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters — found
himself, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons. . . .
“Well,” he said slowly, when he could not pretend to find Asiatic
anti-venoms interesting much longer, “yeah, I — I’ve thought about
it a bit.”
“And?” said Hermione eagerly.
“I dunno,” said Harry, playing for time. He looked up at Ron.
“I thought it was a good idea from the start,” said Ron, who
seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure that
Harry was not going to start shouting again.
Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair.
“You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn’t
you?”
“Yes, Harry,” said Hermione gently, “but all the same, there’s no
point pretending that you’re not good at Defense Against the Dark
Arts, because you are. You were the only person last year who could
throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus,
you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can’t, Viktor al-
ways said —”
Ron looked around at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck; rub-
bing it, he said, “Yeah? What did Vicky say?”
“Ho ho,” said Hermione in a bored voice. “He said Harry knew
how to do stuff even he didn’t, and he was in the final year at
Durmstrang.”
Ron was looking at Hermione suspiciously.


CHAPTER SIXTEEN
“You’re not still in contact with him, are you?”
“So what if I am?” said Hermione coolly, though her face was a lit-
tle pink. “I can have a pen pal if I —”
“He didn’t only want to be your pen pal,” said Ron accusingly.
Hermione shook her head exasperatedly and, ignoring Ron, who
was continuing to watch her, said to Harry, “Well, what do you think?
Will you teach us?”
“Just you and Ron, yeah?”
“Well,” said Hermione, now looking a mite anxious again. “Well
. . . now, don’t fly off the handle again, Harry, please. . . . But I really
think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn. I mean, we’re
talking about defending ourselves against V-Voldemort — oh, don’t
be pathetic, Ron — it doesn’t seem fair if we don’t offer the chance to
other people.”
Harry considered this for a moment, then said, “Yeah, but I doubt
anyone except you two would want to be taught by me. I’m a nutter,
remember?”
“Well, I think you might be surprised how many people would be
interested in hearing what you’ve got to say,” said Hermione seriously.
“Look,” she leaned toward him; Ron, who was still watching her with
a frown on his face, leaned forward to listen too, “you know the first
weekend in October’s a Hogsmeade weekend? How would it be if we
tell anyone who’s interested to meet us in the village and we can talk
it over?”
“Why do we have to do it outside school?” said Ron.
“Because,” said Hermione, returning to the diagram of the Chinese
Chomping Cabbage she was copying, “I don’t think Umbridge would
be very happy if she found out what we were up to.”
Harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogs-
meade, but there was one thing worrying him. Sirius had maintained
a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of

332
IN THE HOG’S HEAD
September; Harry knew they had made him angry by saying that they
did not want him to come — but he still worried from time to time
that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway.
What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up
the street toward them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of
Draco Malfoy?
“Well, you can’t blame him for wanting to get out and about,” said
Ron, when Harry discussed his fears with him and Hermione. “I
mean, he’s been on the run for over two years, hasn’t he, and I know
that can’t have been a laugh, but at least he was free, wasn’t he? And
now he’s just shut up all the time with that lunatic elf.”
Hermione scowled at Ron, but otherwise ignored the slight on
Kreacher.
“The trouble is,” she said to Harry, “until V-Voldemort — oh for
heaven’s sake, Ron — comes out into the open, Sirius is going to have
to stay hidden, isn’t he? I mean, the stupid Ministry isn’t going to re-
alize Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledore’s been
telling the truth about him all along. And once the fools start catch-
ing real Death Eaters again it’ll be obvious Sirius isn’t one . . . I mean,
he hasn’t got the Mark, for one thing.”
“I don’t reckon he’d be stupid enough to turn up,” said Ron brac-
ingly. “Dumbledore’d go mad if he did and Sirius listens to Dumble-
dore even if he doesn’t like what he hears.”
When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, “Listen,
Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might
want to learn some proper Defense Against the Dark Arts, and there
are a couple who seem interested. We’ve told them to meet us in
Hogsmeade.”
“Right,” said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius.
“Don’t worry, Harry,” Hermione said quietly. “You’ve got enough
on your plate without Sirius too.”
She was quite right, of course; he was barely keeping up with his

333
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
homework, though he was doing much better now that he was no
longer spending every evening in detention with Umbridge. Ron was
even further behind with his work than Harry, because while they
both had Quidditch practices twice a week, Ron also had prefect du-
ties. However, Hermione, who was taking more subjects than either of
them, had not only finished all her homework but was also finding
time to knit more elf clothes. Harry had to admit that she was getting
better; it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the
hats and the socks.
The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. Af-
ter breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their
names to the long list of students who had permission from their par-
ents or guardian to visit the village. With a slight pang, Harry re-
membered that if it hadn’t been for Sirius, he would not have been
going at all.
When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as
though trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry. Then he
gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on,
out onto the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day.
“Er — why was Filch sniffing you?” asked Ron, as he, Harry, and
Hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates.
“I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,” said
Harry with a small laugh. “I forgot to tell you . . .”
And he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch
bursting in seconds later, demanding to see the letter. To his slight sur-
prise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more, in-
deed, than he did himself.
“He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But
who had tipped him off?”
“I dunno,” said Harry, shrugging. “Maybe Malfoy, he’d think it was
a laugh.”
They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged


IN THE HOG’S HEAD
boars and turned left onto the road into the village, the wind whip-
ping their hair into their eyes.
“Malfoy?” said Hermione, very skeptically. “Well . . . yes . . .
maybe . . .”
And she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of
Hogsmeade.
“Where are we going anyway?” Harry asked. “The Three Broom-
sticks?”
“Oh — no,” said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, “no, it’s al-
ways packed and really noisy. I’ve told the others to meet us in the
Hog’s Head, that other pub, you know the one, it’s not on the main
road. I think it’s a bit . . . you know . . . dodgy . . . but students don’t
normally go in there, so I don’t think we’ll be overheard.”
They walked down the main street past Zonko’s Joke Shop, where
they were unsurprised to see Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, past the
post office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up
a side street at the top of which stood a small inn. A battered wooden
sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture upon it of
a wild boar’s severed head leaking blood onto the white cloth around
it. The sign creaked in the wind as they approached. All three of them
hesitated outside the door.
“Well, come on,” said Hermione slightly nervously. Harry led the
way inside.
It was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose large bar gave an
impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness. The Hog’s Head bar
comprised one small, dingy, and very dirty room that smelled strongly
of something that might have been goats. The bay windows were so
encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the
room, which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough
wooden tables. The floor seemed at first glance to be earthy, though as
Harry stepped onto it he realized that there was stone beneath what
seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries.

335
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year:
“Yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head,” he had said, explaining
how he had won a dragons egg from a hooded stranger there. At the
time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the
stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw
that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog’s
Head. There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in
dirty gray bandages, though he was still managing to gulp endless
glasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his mouth.
Two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows;
Harry might have thought them dementors if they had not been talk-
ing in strong Yorkshire accents; in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace
sat a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes. They could just
see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly.
“I don’t know about this, Hermione,” Harry muttered, as they
crossed to the bar. He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled
witch. “Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that?”
Hermione cast an appraising eye at the veiled figure.
“Umbridge is shorter than that woman,” she said quietly. “And
anyway, even if Umbridge does come in here there’s nothing she can
do to stop us, Harry, because I’ve double- and triple-checked the
school rules. We’re not out-of-bounds; I specifically asked Professor
Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog’s Head,
and he said yes, but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses.
And I’ve looked up everything I can think of about study groups and
homework groups and they’re definitely allowed. I just don’t think it’s
a good idea if we parade what we’re doing.”
“No,” said Harry dryly, “especially as it’s not exactly a homework
group you’re planning, is it?”
The barman sidled toward them out of a back room. He was a
grumpy-looking old man with a great deal of long gray hair and
beard. He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry.

336
IN THE HOG’S HEAD
“What?” he grunted.
“Three butterbeers, please,” said Hermione.
The man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very
dusty, very dirty bottles, which he slammed on the bar.
“Six Sickles,” he said.
“I’ll get them,” said Harry quickly, passing over the silver. The bar-
man’s eyes traveled over Harry, resting for a fraction of a second on his
scar. Then he turned away and deposited Harry’s money in an ancient
wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione retreated to the farthest table from the bar and
sat down, looking around, while the man in the dirty gray bandages
rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking
drink from the barman.
“You know what?” Ron murmured, looking over at the bar with
enthusiasm. “We could order anything we liked in here, I bet that
bloke would sell us anything, he wouldn’t care. I’ve always wanted to
try firewhisky —”
“You — are — a — prefect,” snarled Hermione.
“Oh,” said Ron, the smile fading from his face. “Yeah . . .”
“So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?” Harry asked,
wrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig.
“Just a couple of people,” Hermione repeated, checking her watch
and then looking anxiously toward the door. “I told them to be here
about now and I’m sure they all know where it is — oh look, this
might be them now —”
The door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight
split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the
incoming rush of a crowd of people.
First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely fol-
lowed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry’s stomach did a back
flip) Cho and one of her usually giggling girlfriends, then (on her own
and looking so dreamy that she might have walked in by accident)

Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, and Angelina John-
son, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-
Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, and a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait
down her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw
boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Cor-
ner, and Terry Boot; Ginny, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with
an upturned nose whom Harry recognized vaguely as being a member
of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and bringing up the rear, Fred and
George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were
carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko’s merchandise.
“A couple of people?” said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. “A couple
of people?”
“Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,” said Hermione happily.
“Ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs?”
The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag
so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed. Possibly he had
never seen his pub so full.
“Hi,” said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his companions
quickly. “Could we have . . . twenty-five butterbeers, please?”
The barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down
his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very
important, he started passing up dusty butterbeers from under the
bar.
“Cheers,” said Fred, handing them out. “Cough up, everyone, I
haven’t got enough gold for all of these. . . .”
Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their
beers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins. He could
not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible
thought occurred to him that they might be expecting some kind of
speech, at which he rounded on Hermione.
“What have you been telling people?” he said in a low voice. “What
are they expecting?”

“I’ve told you, they just want to hear what you’ve got to say,” said
Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously
that she added quickly, “You don’t have to do anything yet, I’ll speak
to them first.”
“Hi, Harry,” said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite
Harry.
Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was excep-
tionally dry. Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron’s right.
Her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but
gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look that told Harry plainly that,
given her way, she would not be here at all.
In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron, and
Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Love-
good gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a
chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry.
“Er,” said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of
nerves. “Well — er — hi.”
The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes con-
tinued to dart back regularly to Harry.
“Well . . . erm . . . well, you know why you’re here. Erm . . . well,
Harry here had the idea — I mean” — Harry had thrown her a sharp
look — “I had the idea — that it might be good if people who
wanted to study Defense Against the Dark Arts — and I mean, really
study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with
us” — (Hermione’s voice became suddenly much stronger and more
confident) — “because nobody could call that Defense Against the
Dark Arts” — “Hear, hear,” said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione
looked heartened — “well, I thought it would be good if we, well,
took matters into our own hands.”
She paused, looked sideways at Harry, and went on, “And by that I
mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just theory but
the real spells —”

339
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
“You want to pass your Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. too
though, I bet?” said Michael Corner.
“Of course I do,” said Hermione at once. “But I want more than
that, I want to be properly trained in Defense because . . . because . . .”
She took a great breath and finished, “Because Lord Voldemort’s
back.”
The reaction was immediate and predictable. Cho’s friend shrieked
and slopped butterbeer down herself, Terry Boot gave a kind of invol-
untary twitch, Padma Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp
that he managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked
fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry.
“Well . . . that’s the plan anyway,” said Hermione. “If you want to
join us, we need to decide how we’re going to —”
“Where’s the proof You-Know-Who’s back?” said the blond Huffle-
puff player in a rather aggressive voice.
“Well, Dumbledore believes it —” Hermione began.
“You mean, Dumbledore believes him,” said the blond boy, nod-
ding at Harry.
“Who are you?” said Ron rather rudely.
“Zacharias Smith,” said the boy, “and I think we’ve got the right to
know exactly what makes him say You-Know-Who’s back.”
“Look,” said Hermione, intervening swiftly, “that’s really not what
this meeting was supposed to be about —”
“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry.
It had just dawned upon him why there were so many people there.
He felt that Hermione should have seen this coming. Some of these
people — maybe even most of them — had turned up in the hope of
hearing Harry’s story firsthand.
“What makes me say You-Know-Who’s back?” he asked, looking
Zacharias straight in the face. “I saw him. But Dumbledore told the
whole school what happened last year, and if you didn’t believe him,

340
IN THE HOG’S HEAD
you don’t believe me, and I’m not wasting an afternoon trying to con-
vince anyone.”
The whole group seemed to have held its breath while Harry spoke.
Harry had the impression that even the barman was listening in. He
was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag; it was becoming steadily
dirtier.
Zacharias said dismissively, “All Dumbledore told us last year was
that Cedric Diggory got killed by You-Know-Who and that you
brought Diggory’s body back to Hogwarts. He didn’t give us details,
he didn’t tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we’d all
like to know —”
“If you’ve come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort
murders someone I can’t help you,” Harry said. His temper, always so
close to the surface these days, was rising again. He did not take his
eyes from Zacharias Smith’s aggressive face, determined not to look at
Cho. “I don’t want to talk about Cedric Diggory, all right? So if that’s
what you’re here for, you might as well clear out.”
He cast an angry look in Hermione’s direction. This was, he felt, all
her fault; she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of
course they had all turned up to see just how wild his story was. . . .
But none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though he
continued to gaze intently at Harry.
“So,” said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again. “So . . .
like I was saying . . . if you want to learn some defense, then we need
to work out how we’re going to do it, how often we’re going to meet,
and where we’re going to —”
“Is it true,” interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back,
looking at Harry, “that you can produce a Patronus?”
There was a murmur of interest around the group at this.
“Yeah,” said Harry slightly defensively.
“A corporeal Patronus?”

341
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
The phrase stirred something in Harry’s memory.
“Er — you don’t know Madam Bones, do you?” he asked.
The girl smiled.
“She’s my auntie,” she said. “I’m Susan Bones. She told me about
your hearing. So — is it really true? You make a stag Patronus?”
“Yes,” said Harry.
“Blimey, Harry!” said Lee, looking deeply impressed. “I never knew
that!”
“Mum told Ron not to spread it around,” said Fred, grinning at
Harry. “She said you got enough attention as it was.”
“She’s not wrong,” mumbled Harry and a couple of people
laughed. The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat.
“And did you kill a basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore’s of-
fice?” demanded Terry Boot. “That’s what one of the portraits on the
wall told me when I was in there last year. . . .”
“Er — yeah, I did, yeah,” said Harry.
Justin Finch-Fletchley whistled, the Creevey brothers exchanged
awestruck looks, and Lavender Brown said “wow” softly. Harry was
feeling slightly hot around the collar now; he was determinedly look-
ing anywhere but at Cho.
“And in our first year,” said Neville to the group at large, “he saved
that Sorcerous Stone —”
“Sorcerer’s,” hissed Hermione.
“Yes, that, from You-Know-Who,” finished Neville.
Hannah Abbott’s eyes were as round as Galleons.
“And that’s not to mention,” said Cho (Harry’s eyes snapped onto
her, she was looking at him, smiling; his stomach did another somer-
sault), “all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament
last year — getting past dragons and merpeople and acromantulas and
things. . . .”
There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table.

342
IN THE HOG’S HEAD
Harry’s insides were squirming. He was trying to arrange his face so
that he did not look too pleased with himself. The fact that Cho had
just praised him made it much, much harder for him to say the thing
he had sworn to himself he would tell them.
“Look,” he said and everyone fell silent at once, “I . . . I don’t want
to sound like I’m trying to be modest or anything, but . . . I had a lot
of help with all that stuff. . . .”
“Not with the dragon, you didn’t,” said Michael Corner at once.
“That was a seriously cool bit of flying. . . .”
“Yeah, well —” said Harry, feeling it would be churlish to disagree.
“And nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer,”
said Susan Bones.
“No,” said Harry, “no, okay, I know I did bits of it without help,
but the point I’m trying to make is —”
“Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff?” said
Zacharias Smith.
“Here’s an idea,” said Ron loudly, before Harry could speak, “why
don’t you shut your mouth?”
Perhaps the word “weasel” had affected Ron particularly strongly;
in any case, he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like
nothing better than to thump him. Zacharias flushed.
“Well, we’ve all turned up to learn from him, and now he’s telling
us he can’t really do any of it,” he said.
“That’s not what he said,” snarled Fred Weasley.
“Would you like us to clean out your ears for you?” inquired
George, pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from in-
side one of the Zonko’s bags.
“Or any part of your body, really, we’re not fussy where we stick
this,” said Fred.
“Yes, well,” said Hermione hastily, “moving on . . . the point is, are
we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry?”

343
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
There was a murmur of general agreement. Zacharias folded his
arms and said nothing, though perhaps this was because he was too
busy keeping an eye on the instrument in George’s hand.
“Right,” said Hermione, looking relieved that something had at
last been settled. “Well, then, the next question is how often we do it.
I really don’t think there’s any point in meeting less than once a
week —”
“Hang on,” said Angelina, “we need to make sure this doesn’t clash
with our Quidditch practice.”
“No,” said Cho, “nor with ours.”
“Nor ours,” added Zacharias Smith.
“I’m sure we can find a night that suits everyone,” said Hermione,
slightly impatiently, “but you know, this is rather important, we’re
talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort’s
Death Eaters —”
“Well said!” barked Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry had been ex-
pecting to speak long before this. “Personally I think this is really im-
portant, possibly more important than anything else we’ll do this year,
even with our O.W.L.s coming up!”
He looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry,
“Surely not!” When nobody spoke, he went on, “I, personally, am at a
loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher upon us
at this critical period. Obviously they are in denial about the return of
You-Know-Who, but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively pre-
vent us from using defensive spells —”
“We think the reason Umbridge doesn’t want us trained in Defense
Against the Dark Arts,” said Hermione, “is that she’s got some . . .
some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school
as a kind of private army. She thinks he’d mobilize us against the
Ministry.”
Nearly everybody looked stunned at this news; everybody except

344
IN THE HOG’S HEAD
Luna Lovegood, who piped up, “Well, that makes sense. After all,
Cornelius Fudge has got his own private army.”
“What?” said Harry, completely thrown by this unexpected piece
of information.
“Yes, he’s got an army of heliopaths,” said Luna solemnly.
“No, he hasn’t,” snapped Hermione.
“Yes, he has,” said Luna.
“What are heliopaths?” asked Neville, looking blank.
“They’re spirits of fire,” said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening
so that she looked madder than ever. “Great tall flaming creatures that
gallop across the ground burning everything in front of —”
“They don’t exist, Neville,” said Hermione tartly.
“Oh yes they do!” said Luna angrily.
“I’m sorry, but where’s the proof of that?” snapped Hermione.
“There are plenty of eyewitness accounts, just because you’re so
narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose
before you —”
“Hem, hem,” said Ginny in such a good imitation of Professor Um-
bridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed.
“Weren’t we trying to decide how often we’re going to meet and get
Defense lessons?”
“Yes,” said Hermione at once, “yes, we were, you’re right. . . .”
“Well, once a week sounds cool,” said Lee Jordan.
“As long as —” began Angelina.
“Yes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,” said Hermione in a tense
voice. “Well, the other thing to decide is where we’re going to
meet. . . .”
This was rather more difficult; the whole group fell silent.
“Library?” suggested Katie Bell after a few moments.
“I can’t see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in
the library,” said Harry.

345
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
“Maybe an unused classroom?” said Dean.
“Yeah,” said Ron, “McGonagall might let us have hers, she did
when Harry was practicing for the Triwizard. . . .”
But Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would not be so ac-
commodating this time. For all that Hermione had said about study
and homework groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling this
one might be considered a lot more rebellious.
“Right, well, we’ll try to find somewhere,” said Hermione. “We’ll
send a message round to everybody when we’ve got a time and a place
for the first meeting.”
She rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill,
then hesitated, rather as though she was steeling herself to say
something.
“I-I think everybody should write their name down, just so we
know who was here. But I also think,” she took a deep breath, “that
we all ought to agree not to shout about what we’re doing. So if you
sign, you’re agreeing not to tell Umbridge — or anybody else — what
we’re up to.”
Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully put down his
signature, but Harry noticed at once that several people looked less
than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list.
“Er . . .” said Zacharias slowly, not taking the parchment that
George was trying to pass him. “Well . . . I’m sure Ernie will tell me
when the meeting is.”
But Ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing too. Hermione
raised her eyebrows at him.
“I — well, we are prefects,” Ernie burst out. “And if this list was
found . . . well, I mean to say . . . you said yourself, if Umbridge finds
out . . .”
“You just said this group was the most important thing you’d do
this year,” Harry reminded him.
“I — yes,” said Ernie, “yes, I do believe that, it’s just . . .”

346
IN THE HOG’S HEAD
“Ernie, do you really think I’d leave that list lying around?” said
Hermione testily.
“No. No, of course not,” said Ernie, looking slightly less anxious.
“I — yes, of course I’ll sign.”
Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though Harry saw Cho’s
friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her name.
When the last person — Zacharias — had signed, Hermione took
the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag. There was an
odd feeling in the group now. It was as though they had just signed
some kind of contract.
“Well, time’s ticking on,” said Fred briskly, getting to his feet.
“George, Lee, and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase,
we’ll be seeing you all later.”
In twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave too. Cho
made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leav-
ing, her long dark curtain of hair swinging forward to hide her face,
but her friend stood beside her, arms folded, clicking her tongue, so
that Cho had little choice but to leave with her. As her friend ushered
her through the door, Cho looked back and waved at Harry.
“Well, I think that went quite well,” said Hermione happily, as she,
Harry, and Ron walked out of the Hog’s Head into the bright sunlight
a few moments later, Harry and Ron still clutching their bottles of
butterbeer.
“That Zacharias bloke’s a wart,” said Ron, who was glowering after
the figure of Smith just discernible in the distance.
“I don’t like him much either,” admitted Hermione, “but he over-
heard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he
seemed really interested in coming, so what could I say? But the more
people the better really — I mean, Michael Corner and his friends
wouldn’t have come if he hadn’t been going out with Ginny —”
Ron, who had been draining the last few drops from his butterbeer
bottle, gagged and sprayed butterbeer down his front.

347
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
“He’s WHAT?” said Ron, outraged, his ears now resembling curls
of raw beef. “She’s going out with — my sister’s going — what d’you
mean, Michael Corner?”
“Well, that’s why he and his friends came, I think — well, they’re
obviously interested in learning defense, but if Ginny hadn’t told
Michael what was going on —”
“When did this — when did she — ?”
“They met at the Yule Ball and they got together at the end of last
year,” said Hermione composedly. They had turned into the High
Street and she paused outside Scrivenshaft’s Quill Shop, where there
was a handsome display of pheasant-feather quills in the window.
“Hmm . . . I could do with a new quill.”
She turned into the shop. Harry and Ron followed her.
“Which one was Michael Corner?” Ron demanded furiously.
“The dark one,” said Hermione.
“I didn’t like him,” said Ron at once.
“Big surprise,” said Hermione under her breath.
“But,” said Ron, following Hermione along a row of quills in cop-
per pots, “I thought Ginny fancied Harry!”
Hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head.
“Ginny used to fancy Harry, but she gave up on him months ago.
Not that she doesn’t like you, of course,” she added kindly to Harry
while she examined a long black-and-gold quill.
Harry, whose head was still full of Cho’s parting wave, did not find
this subject quite as interesting as Ron, who was positively quivering
with indignation, but it did bring something home to him that until
now he had not really registered.
“So that’s why she talks now?” he asked Hermione. “She never used
to talk in front of me.”
“Exactly,” said Hermione. “Yes, I think I’ll have this one. . . .”
She went up to the counter and handed over fifteen Sickles and two
Knuts, Ron still breathing down her neck.

348
IN THE HOG’S HEAD
“Ron,” she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet, “this is
exactly why Ginny hasn’t told you she’s seeing Michael, she knew
you’d take it badly. So don’t harp on about it, for heaven’s sake.”
“What d’you mean, who’s taking anything badly? I’m not going to
harp on about anything . . .”
Ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the
street. Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry and then said in an under-
tone, while Ron was muttering imprecations about Michael Corner,
“And talking about Michael and Ginny . . . what about Cho and
you?”
“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly.
It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him; a
burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold —
had he been that obvious?
“Well,” said Hermione, smiling slightly, “she just couldn’t keep her
eyes off you, could she?”
Harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of
Hogsmeade was.

arry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done
all term. He and Ron spent much of Sunday catching up
with all their homework again, and although this could hardly be
called fun, the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than
sitting hunched over tables in the common room, they took their work
outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of
the lake. Hermione, who of course was up to date with all her work,
brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting nee-
dles so that they flashed and clicked in midair beside her, producing
more hats and scarves.
The knowledge that they were doing something to resist Umbridge
and the Ministry, and that he was a key part of the rebellion, gave
Harry a feeling of immense satisfaction. He kept reliving Saturday’s
meeting in his mind: all those people, coming to him to learn Defense
Against the Dark Arts . . . and the looks on their faces as they had
heard some of the things he had done . . . and Cho praising his per-
formance in the Triwizard Tournament. . . . The knowledge that all


NUMBER TWENTY-FOUR
those people did not think him a lying weirdo, but someone to be ad-
mired, buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on Monday
morning, despite the imminent prospect of all his least favorite classes.
He and Ron headed downstairs from their dormitory together, dis-
cussing Angelina’s idea that they were to work on a new move called
the Sloth Grip Roll during that night’s Quidditch practice, and not
until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they no-
tice the addition to the room that had already attracted the attention
of a small group of people.
A large sign had been affixed to the Gryffindor notice board, so
large that it covered everything else on there — the lists of second-
hand spellbooks for sale, the regular reminders of school rules from
Argus Filch, the Quidditch team training schedule, the offers to barter
certain Chocolate Frog cards for others, the Weasleys’ new advertise-
ment for testers, the dates of the Hogsmeade weekends, and the lost-
and-found notices. The new sign was printed in large black letters and
there was a highly official-looking seal at the bottom beside a neat
and curly signature.
— by order of —

Clubs are henceforth disbanded.

Harry and Ron read the notice over the heads of some anxious-
looking second years.
“Does this mean they’re going to shut down the Gobstones Club?”
one of them asked his friend.
“I reckon you’ll be okay with Gobstones,” Ron said darkly, making
the second year jump. “I don’t think we’re going to be as lucky,
though, do you?” he asked Harry as the second years hurried away.
Harry was reading the notice through again. The happiness that
had filled him since Saturday was gone. His insides were pulsing with
rage.
“This isn’t a coincidence,” he said, his hands forming fists. “She
knows.”
“She can’t,” said Ron at once.
“There were people listening in that pub. And let’s face it, we don’t
know how many of the people who turned up we can trust. . . . Any
of them could have run off and told Umbridge. . . .”
And he had thought they believed him, thought they even admired
him . . .
“Zacharias Smith!” said Ron at once, punching a fist into his hand.
“Or — I thought that Michael Corner had a really shifty look too —”


“I wonder if Hermione’s seen this yet?” Harry said, looking around
at the door to the girls’ dormitories.
“Let’s go and tell her,” said Ron. He bounded forward, pulled open
the door, and set off up the spiral staircase.
He was on the sixth stair when it happened. There was a loud, wail-
ing, klaxonlike sound and the steps melted together to make a long,
smooth stone slide. There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep
running, arms working madly like windmills, then he toppled over
backward and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on
his back at Harry’s feet.
“Er — I don’t think we’re allowed in the girls’ dormitories,” said
Harry, pulling Ron to his feet and trying not to laugh.
Two fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide.
“Oooh, who tried to get upstairs?” they giggled happily, leaping to
their feet and ogling Harry and Ron.
“Me,” said Ron, who was still rather disheveled. “I didn’t realize
that would happen. It’s not fair!” he added to Harry, as the girls
headed off for the portrait hole, still giggling madly. “Hermione’s al-
lowed in our dormitory, how come we’re not allowed — ?”
“Well, it’s an old-fashioned rule,” said Hermione, who had just slid
neatly onto a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet,
“but it says in Hogwarts, A History that the founders thought boys
were less trustworthy than girls. Anyway, why were you trying to get
in there?”
“To see you — look at this!” said Ron, dragging her over to the no-
tice board.
Hermione’s eyes slid rapidly down the notice. Her expression be-
came stony.
“Someone must have blabbed to her!” Ron said angrily.
“They can’t have done,” said Hermione in a low voice.
“You’re so naive,” said Ron, “you think just because you’re all hon-
orable and trustworthy —”

353
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
“No, they can’t have done because I put a jinx on that piece of
parchment we all signed,” said Hermione grimly. “Believe me, if any-
one’s run off and told Umbridge, we’ll know exactly who they are and
they will really regret it.”
“What’ll happen to them?” said Ron eagerly.
“Well, put it this way,” said Hermione, “it’ll make Eloise Midgen’s
acne look like a couple of cute freckles. Come on, let’s get down to
breakfast and see what the others think. . . . I wonder whether this has
been put up in all the Houses?”
It was immediately apparent on entering the Great Hall that Um-
bridge’s sign had not only appeared in Gryffindor Tower. There was a
peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra measure of move-
ment in the Hall as people scurried up and down their tables confer-
ring on what they had read. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had barely
taken their seats when Neville, Dean, Fred, George, and Ginny de-
scended upon them.
“Did you see it?”
“D’you reckon she knows?”
“What are we going to do?”
They were all looking at Harry. He glanced around to make sure
there were no teachers near them.
“We’re going to do it anyway, of course,” he said quietly.
“Knew you’d say that,” said George, beaming and thumping Harry
on the arm.
“The prefects as well?” said Fred, looking quizzically at Ron and
Hermione.
“Of course,” said Hermione coolly.
“Here comes Ernie and Hannah Abbott,” said Ron, looking over
his shoulder. “And those Ravenclaw blokes and Smith . . . and no one
looks very spotty.”
Hermione looked alarmed.
“Never mind spots, the idiots can’t come over here now, it’ll look

really suspicious — sit down!” she mouthed to Ernie and Hannah,
gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the Hufflepuff table. “Later!
We’ll — talk — to — you — later!”
“I’ll tell Michael,” said Ginny impatiently, swinging herself off her
bench. “The fool, honestly . . .”
She hurried off toward the Ravenclaw table; Harry watched her go.
Cho was sitting not far away, talking to the curly-haired friend she
had brought along to the Hog’s Head. Would Umbridge’s notice scare
her off meeting them again?
But the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were
leaving the Great Hall for History of Magic.
“Harry! Ron!”
It was Angelina and she was hurrying toward them looking per-
fectly desperate.
“It’s okay,” said Harry quietly, when she was near enough to hear
him. “We’re still going to —”
“You realize she’s including Quidditch in this?” Angelina said over
him. “We have to go and ask permission to re-form the Gryffindor
team!”
“What?” said Harry.
“No way,” said Ron, appalled.
“You read the sign, it mentions teams too! So listen, Harry . . . I am
saying this for the last time. . . . Please, please don’t lose your temper
with Umbridge again or she might not let us play anymore!”
“Okay, okay,” said Harry, for Angelina looked as though she was on
the verge of tears. “Don’t worry, I’ll behave myself. . . .”
“Bet Umbridge is in History of Magic,” said Ron grimly, as they set
off for Binns’s lesson. “She hasn’t inspected Binns yet. . . . Bet you
anything she’s there. . . .”
But he was wrong; the only teacher present when they entered was
Professor Binns, floating an inch or so above his chair as usual and
preparing to continue his monotonous drone on giant wars. Harry

did not even attempt to follow what he was saying today; he doodled
idly on his parchment ignoring Hermione’s frequent glares and
nudges, until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up
angrily.
“What?”
She pointed at the window. Harry looked around. Hedwig was
perched on the narrow window ledge, gazing through the thick glass
at him, a letter tied to her leg. Harry could not understand it; they had
just had breakfast, why on earth hadn’t she delivered the letter then, as
usual? Many of his classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other
too.
“Oh, I’ve always loved that owl, she’s so beautiful,” Harry heard
Lavender sigh to Parvati.
He glanced around at Professor Binns who continued to read his
notes, serenely unaware that the class’s attention was even less focused
upon him than usual. Harry slipped quietly off his chair, crouched
down, and hurried along the row to the window, where he slid the
catch and opened it very slowly.
He had expected Hedwig to hold out her leg so that he could re-
move the letter and then fly off to the Owlery, but the moment the
window was open wide enough she hopped inside, hooting dolefully.
He closed the window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns,
crouched low again, and sped back to his seat with Hedwig on his
shoulder. He regained his seat, transferred Hedwig to his lap, and
made to remove the letter tied to her leg.
It was only then that he realized that Hedwig’s feathers were oddly
ruffled; some were bent the wrong way, and she was holding one of
her wings at an odd angle.
“She’s hurt!” Harry whispered, bending his head low over her.
Hermione and Ron leaned in closer; Hermione even put down her
quill. “Look — there’s something wrong with her wing —”
Hedwig was quivering; when Harry made to touch the wing she

gave a little jump, all her feathers on end as though she was inflating
herself, and gazed at him reproachfully.
“Professor Binns,” said Harry loudly, and everyone in the class
turned to look at him. “I’m not feeling well.”
Professor Binns raised his eyes from his notes, looking amazed, as
always, to find the room in front of him full of people.
“Not feeling well?” he repeated hazily.
“Not at all well,” said Harry firmly, getting to his feet while con-
cealing Hedwig behind his back. “So I think I’ll need to go to the hos-
pital wing.”
“Yes,” said Professor Binns, clearly very much wrong-footed. “Yes
. . . yes, hospital wing . . . well, off you go, then, Perkins . . .”
Once outside the room Harry returned Hedwig to his shoulder and
hurried off up the corridor, pausing to think only when he was out of
sight of Binns’s door. His first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig
would have been Hagrid, of course, but as he had no idea where
Hagrid was, his only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly-
Plank and hope she would help.
He peered out of a window at the blustery, overcast grounds. There
was no sign of her anywhere near Hagrid’s cabin; if she was not teach-
ing, she was probably in the staffroom. He set off downstairs, Hedwig
hooting feebly as she swayed on his shoulder.
Two stone gargoyles flanked the staffroom door. As Harry ap-
proached, one of them croaked, “You should be in class, sunny Jim.”
“This is urgent,” said Harry curtly.
“Ooooh, urgent, is it?” said the other gargoyle in a high-pitched
voice. “Well, that’s put us in our place, hasn’t it?”
Harry knocked; he heard footsteps and then the door opened and
he found himself face-to-face with Professor McGonagall.
“You haven’t been given another detention!” she said at once, her
square spectacles flashing alarmingly.
“No, Professor!” said Harry hastily.

357
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
“Well then, why are you out of class?”
“It’s urgent, apparently,” said the second gargoyle snidely.
“I’m looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank,” Harry explained. “It’s
my owl, she’s injured.”
“Injured owl, did you say?”
Professor Grubbly-Plank appeared at Professor McGonagall’s
shoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the Daily Prophet.
“Yes,” said Harry, lifting Hedwig carefully off his shoulder, “she
turned up after the other post owls and her wing’s all funny, look —”
Professor Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth
and took Hedwig from Harry while Professor McGonagall watched.
“Hmm,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, her pipe waggling slightly
as she talked. “Looks like something’s attacked her. Can’t think what
would have done it, though. . . . Thestrals will sometimes go for
birds, of course, but Hagrid’s got the Hogwarts thestrals well trained
not to touch owls . . .”
Harry neither knew nor cared what thestrals were, he just wanted
to know that Hedwig was going to be all right. Professor McGonagall,
however, looked sharply at Harry and said, “Do you know how far
this owl’s traveled, Potter?”
“Er,” said Harry. “From London, I think.”
He met her eyes briefly and knew that she understood “London” to
mean “number twelve, Grimmauld Place” by the way her eyebrows
had joined in the middle.
Professor Grubbly-Plank pulled a monocle out of the inside of her
robes and screwed it into her eye to examine Hedwig’s wing closely. “I
should be able to sort this out if you leave her with me, Potter,” she
said. “She shouldn’t be flying long distances for a few days, in any case.”
“Er — right — thanks,” said Harry, just as the bell rang for break.
“No problem,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank gruffly, turning back
into the staffroom.

“Just a moment, Wilhelmina!” said Professor McGonagall. “Pot-
ter’s letter!”
“Oh yeah!” said Harry, who had momentarily forgotten the scroll
tied to Hedwig’s leg. Professor Grubbly-Plank handed it over and then
disappeared into the staffroom carrying Hedwig, who was staring at
Harry as though unable to believe he would give her away like this.
Feeling slightly guilty, he turned to go, but Professor McGonagall
called him back.
“Potter!”
“Yes, Professor?”
She glanced up and down the corridor; there were students coming
from both directions.
“Bear in mind,” she said quickly and quietly, her eyes on the scroll
in his hand, “that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts
may be being watched, won’t you?”
“I —” said Harry, but the flood of students rolling along the corri-
dor was almost upon him. Professor McGonagall gave him a curt nod
and retreated into the staffroom, leaving Harry to be swept out into
the courtyard with the crowd. Here he spotted Ron and Hermione al-
ready standing in a sheltered corner, their cloak collars turned up
against the wind. Harry slit open the scroll as he hurried toward them
and found five words in Sirius’s handwriting:
Today, same time, same place.
“Is Hedwig okay?” asked Hermione anxiously, the moment he was
within earshot.
“Where did you take her?” asked Ron.
“To Grubbly-Plank,” said Harry. “And I met McGonagall. . . .
Listen. . . .”
And he told them what Professor McGonagall had said. To his

359
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
surprise, neither of the others looked shocked; on the contrary, they
exchanged significant looks.
“What?” said Harry, looking from Ron to Hermione and back
again.
“Well, I was just saying to Ron . . . what if someone had tried to in-
tercept Hedwig? I mean, she’s never been hurt on a flight before, has
she?”
“Who’s the letter from anyway?” asked Ron, taking the note from
Harry.
“Snuffles,” said Harry quietly.
“ ‘Same time, same place’? Does he mean the fire in the common
room?”
“Obviously,” said Hermione, also reading the note. She looked un-
easy. “I just hope nobody else has read this. . . .”
“But it was still sealed and everything,” said Harry, trying to con-
vince himself as much as her. “And nobody would understand what it
meant if they didn’t know where we’d spoken to him before, would
they?”
“I don’t know,” said Hermione anxiously, hitching her bag back
over her shoulder as the bell rang again. “It wouldn’t be exactly diffi-
cult to reseal the scroll by magic. . . . And if anyone’s watching the
Floo Network . . . but I don’t really see how we can warn him not to
come without that being intercepted too!”
They trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for Potions, all
three of them lost in thought, but as they reached the bottom of the
stairs they were recalled to themselves by the voice of Draco Malfoy,
who was standing just outside Snape’s classroom door, waving around
an official-looking piece of parchment and talking much louder than
was necessary so that they could hear every word.
“Yeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to
continue playing straightaway, I went to ask her first thing this morn-
ing. Well, it was pretty much automatic, I mean, she knows my father

360

really well, he’s always popping in and out of the Ministry. . . . It’ll be
interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing,
wont it?”
“Don’t rise,” Hermione whispered imploringly to Harry and Ron,
who were both watching Malfoy, faces set and fists clenched. “It’s
what he wants. . . .”
“I mean,” said Malfoy, raising his voice a little more, his gray eyes
glittering malevolently in Harry and Ron’s direction, “if it’s a question
of influence with the Ministry, I don’t think they’ve got much chance.
. . . From what my father says, they’ve been looking for an excuse to
sack Arthur Weasley for years. . . . And as for Potter . . . My father
says it’s a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St.
Mungo’s. . . . apparently they’ve got a special ward for people whose
brains have been addled by magic. . . .”
Malfoy made a grotesque face, his mouth sagging open and his eyes
rolling. Crabbe and Goyle gave their usual grunts of laughter, Pansy
Parkinson shrieked with glee.
Something collided hard with Harry’s shoulder, knocking him
sideways. A split second later he realized that Neville had just charged
past him, heading straight for Malfoy.
“Neville, no!”
Harry leapt forward and seized the back of Neville’s robes; Neville
struggled frantically, his fists flailing, trying desperately to get at Mal-
foy who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked.
“Help me!” Harry flung at Ron, managing to get an arm around
Neville’s neck and dragging him backward, away from the Slytherins.
Crabbe and Goyle were now flexing their arms, closing in front of
Malfoy, ready for the fight. Ron hurried forward and seized Neville’s
arms; together, he and Harry succeeded in dragging Neville back into
the Gryffindor line. Neville’s face was scarlet; the pressure Harry was
exerting on his throat rendered him quite incomprehensible, but odd
words spluttered from his mouth.

361
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
“Not. . . funny . . . don’t . . . Mungo’s . . . show . . . him . . .”
The dungeon door opened. Snape appeared there. His black eyes
swept up the Gryffindor line to the point where Harry and Ron were
wrestling with Neville.
“Fighting, Potter, Weasley, Longbottom?” Snape said in his cold,
sneering voice. “Ten points from Gryffindor. Release Longbottom,
Potter, or it will be detention. Inside, all of you.”
Harry let go of Neville, who stood panting and glaring at him.
“I had to stop you,” Harry gasped, picking up his bag. “Crabbe and
Goyle would’ve torn you apart.”
Neville said nothing, he merely snatched up his own bag and
stalked off into the dungeon.
“What in the name of Merlin,” said Ron slowly, as they followed
Neville, “was that about?”
Harry did not answer. He knew exactly why the subject of people
who were in St. Mungo’s because of magical damage to their brains
was highly distressing to Neville, but he had sworn to Dumbledore
that he would not tell anyone Neville’s secret. Even Neville did not
know that Harry knew.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their usual seats at the back of the
class and pulled out parchment, quills, and their copies of One Thou-
sand Magical Herbs and Fungi. The class around them was whispering
about what Neville had just done, but when Snape closed the dun-
geon door with an echoing bang everybody fell silent immediately.
“You will notice,” said Snape in his low, sneering voice, “that we
have a guest with us today.”
He gestured toward the dim corner of the dungeon, and Harry saw
Professor Umbridge sitting there, clipboard on her knee. He glanced
sideways at Ron and Hermione, his eyebrows raised. Snape and Um-
bridge, the two teachers he hated most . . . it was hard to decide
which he wanted to triumph over the other.

“We are continuing with our Strengthening Solutions today, you
will find your mixtures as you left them last lesson, if correctly made
they should have matured well over the weekend — instructions” —
he waved his wand again — “on the board. Carry on.”
Professor Umbridge spent the first half hour of the lesson making
notes in her corner. Harry was very interested in hearing her question
Snape, so interested, that he was becoming careless with his potion
again.
“Salamander blood, Harry!” Hermione moaned, grabbing his wrist
to prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time. “Not
pomegranate juice!”
“Right,” said Harry vaguely, putting down the bottle and continu-
ing to watch the corner. Umbridge had just gotten to her feet. “Ha,”
he said softly, as she strode between two lines of desks toward Snape,
who was bending over Dean Thomas’s cauldron.
“Well, the class seems fairly advanced for their level,” she said
briskly to Snape’s back. “Though I would question whether it is ad-
visable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think
the Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus.”
Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her.
“Now . . . how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?” she
asked, her quill poised over her clipboard.
“Fourteen years,” Snape replied. His expression was unfathomable.
His eyes on Snape, Harry added a few drops to his potion; it hissed
menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange.
“You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I
believe?” Professor Umbridge asked Snape.
“Yes,” said Snape quietly.
“But you were unsuccessful?”
Snape’s lip curled.
“Obviously.”

363
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Professor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard.
“And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark
Arts post since you first joined the school, I believe?”
“Yes,” said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips. He looked very
angry.
“Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused
to appoint you?” asked Umbridge.
“I suggest you ask him,” said Snape jerkily.
“Oh I shall,” said Professor Umbridge with a sweet smile.
“I suppose this is relevant?” Snape asked, his black eyes narrowed.
“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge. “Yes, the Ministry wants a
thorough understanding of teachers’ — er — backgrounds. . . .”
She turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began ques-
tioning her about the lessons. Snape looked around at Harry and their
eyes met for a second. Harry hastily dropped his gaze to his potion,
which was now congealing foully and giving off a strong smell of
burned rubber.
“No marks again, then, Potter,” said Snape maliciously, emptying
Harry’s cauldron with a wave of his wand. “You will write me an essay
on the correct composition of this potion, indicating how and why
you went wrong, to be handed in next lesson, do you understand?”
“Yes,” said Harry furiously. Snape had already given them home-
work, and he had Quidditch practice this evening; this would mean
another couple of sleepless nights. It did not seem possible that he had
awoken that morning feeling very happy. All he felt now was a fervent
desire for this day to end as soon as possible.
“Maybe I’ll skive off Divination,” he said glumly as they stood
again in the courtyard after lunch, the wind whipping at the hems of
robes and brims of hats. “I’ll pretend to be ill and do Snape’s essay in-
stead, then I won’t have to stay up half the night. . . .”
“You can’t skive off Divination,” said Hermione severely.

“Hark who’s talking, you walked out of Divination, you hate
Trelawney!” said Ron indignantly.
“I don’t hate her,” said Hermione loftily. “I just think she’s an ab-
solutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud. . . . But Harry’s already
missed History of Magic and I don’t think he ought to miss anything
else today!”
There was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an hour later
Harry took his seat in the hot, over-perfumed atmosphere of the Div-
ination classroom feeling angry at everybody. Professor Trelawney was
handing out copies of The Dream Oracle yet again; he would surely be
much better employed doing Snape’s punishment essay than sitting
here trying to find meaning in a lot of made-up dreams.
It seemed, however, that he was not the only person in Divination
who was in a temper. Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the Or-
acle down on the table between Harry and Ron and swept away, her
lips pursed; she threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and
Dean, narrowly avoiding Seamus’s head, and thrust the final one into
Neville’s chest with such force that he slipped off his pouf.
“Well, carry on!” said Professor Trelawney loudly, her voice high
pitched and somewhat hysterical. “You know what to do! Or am I such
a substandard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book?”
The class stared perplexedly at her and then at each other. Harry,
however, thought he knew what was the matter. As Professor
Trelawney flounced back to the high-backed teacher’s chair, her mag-
nified eyes full of angry tears, he leaned his head closer to Ron’s and
muttered, “I think she’s got the results of her inspection back.”
“Professor?” said Parvati Patil in a hushed voice (she and Lavender
had always rather admired Professor Trelawney). “Professor, is there
anything — er — wrong?”
“Wrong!” cried Professor Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emo-
tion. “Certainly not! I have been insulted, certainly. . . . Insinuations

365
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
have been made against me. . . . Unfounded accusations levelled . . .
but no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not. . . .”
She took a great shuddering breath and looked away from Parvati,
angry tears spilling from under her glasses.
“I say nothing,” she choked, “of sixteen years’ devoted service. . . .
It has passed, apparently, unnoticed. . . . But I shall not be insulted,
no, I shall not!”
“But Professor, who’s insulting you?” asked Parvati timidly.
“The establishment!” said Professor Trelawney in a deep, dramatic,
wavering voice. “Yes, those with eyes too clouded by the Mundane to
See as I See, to Know as I Know . . . Of course, we Seers have always
been feared, always persecuted. . . . It is — alas — our fate. . . .”
She gulped, dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of her shawl,
and then pulled a small, embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve,
into which she blew her nose very hard with a sound like Peeves blow-
ing a raspberry. Ron sniggered. Lavender shot him a disgusted look.
“Professor,” said Parvati, “do you mean . . . is it something Profes-
sor Umbridge . . . ?”
“Do not speak to me about that woman!” cried Professor
Trelawney, leaping to her feet, her beads rattling and her spectacles
flashing. “Kindly continue with your work!”
And she spent the rest of the lesson striding among them, tears still
leaking from behind her glasses, muttering what sounded like threats
under her breath.
“. . . may well choose to leave . . . the indignity of it . . . on proba-
tion . . . we shall see . . . how she dares . . .”
“You and Umbridge have got something in common,” Harry told
Hermione quietly when they met again in Defense Against the Dark
Arts. “She obviously reckons Trelawney’s an old fraud too. . . . Looks
like she’s put her on probation.”
Umbridge entered the room as he spoke, wearing her black velvet
bow and an expression of great smugness.

“Good afternoon, class.”
“Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,” they chanted drearily.
“Wands away, please . . .”
But there was no answering flurry of movement this time; nobody
had bothered to take out their wands.
“Please turn to page thirty-four of Defensive Magical Theory and read
the third chapter, entitled ‘The Case for Non-Offensive Responses to
Magical Attack.’ There will be —”
“— no need to talk,” Harry, Ron, and Hermione said together un-
der their breaths.
“No Quidditch practice,” said Angelina in hollow tones when Harry,
Ron, and Hermione entered the common room that night after
dinner.
“But I kept my temper!” said Harry, horrified. “I didn’t say any-
thing to her, Angelina, I swear, I —”
“I know, I know,” said Angelina miserably. “She just said she
needed a bit of time to consider.”
“Consider what?” said Ron angrily. “She’s given the Slytherins per-
mission, why not us?”
But Harry could imagine how much Umbridge was enjoying hold-
ing the threat of no Gryffindor Quidditch team over their heads and
could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that
weapon over them too soon.
“Well,” said Hermione, “look on the bright side — at least now
you’ll have time to do Snape’s essay!”
“That’s a bright side, is it?” snapped Harry, while Ron stared in-
credulously at Hermione. “No Quidditch practice and extra Potions?”
Harry slumped down into a chair, dragged his Potions essay reluc-
tantly from his bag, and set to work.
It was very hard to concentrate; even though he knew that Sirius
was not due in the fire until much later he could not help glancing

into the flames every few minutes just in case. There was also an in-
credible amount of noise in the room: Fred and George appeared fi-
nally to have perfected one type of Skiving Snackbox, which they were
taking turns to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd.
First, Fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew, at
which he would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in
front of them. Then he would force down the purple end of the chew,
at which the vomiting would immediately cease. Lee Jordan, who was
assisting the demonstration, was lazily vanishing the vomit at regular
intervals with the same Vanishing Spell Snape kept using on Harry’s
potions.
What with the regular sounds of retching, cheering, and Fred and
George taking advance orders from the crowd, Harry was finding it
exceptionally difficult to focus on the correct method for Strengthen-
ing Solutions. Hermione was not helping matters; the cheers and
sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred and George’s bucket were
punctuated by loud and disapproving sniffs that Harry found, if any-
thing, more distracting.
“Just go and stop them, then!” he said irritably, after crossing out
the wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time.
“I can’t, they’re not technically doing anything wrong,” said Her-
mione through gritted teeth. “They’re quite within their rights to eat
the foul things themselves, and I can’t find a rule that says the other
idiots aren’t entitled to buy them, not unless they’re proven to be dan-
gerous in some way, and it doesn’t look as though they are. . . .”
She, Harry, and Ron watched George projectile-vomit into the
bucket, gulp down the rest of the chew, and straighten up, beaming
with his arms wide to protracted applause.
“You know, I don’t get why Fred and George only got three O.W.L.s
each,” said Harry, watching as Fred, George, and Lee collected gold
from the eager crowd. “They really know their stuff. . . .”

368
EDUCATIONAL DECREE

“Oh, they only know flashy stuff that’s no real use to anyone,” said
Hermione disparagingly.
“No real use?” said Ron in a strained voice. “Hermione, they’ve got
about twenty-six Galleons already. . . .”
It was a long while before the crowd around the Weasleys dispersed,
and then Fred, Lee, and George sat up counting their takings even
longer, so that it was well past midnight when Harry, Ron, and
Hermione finally had the common room to themselves again. At long
last, Fred closed the doorway to the boys’ dormitories behind him,
rattling his box of Galleons ostentatiously so that Hermione scowled.
Harry, who was making very little progress with his Potions essay, de-
cided to give it up for the night. As he put his books away, Ron, who
was dozing lightly in an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke,
looked blearily into the fire and said, “Sirius!”
Harry whipped around; Sirius’s untidy dark head was sitting in the
fire again.
“Hi,” he said, grinning.
“Hi,” chorused Harry, Ron, and Hermione, all three kneeling
down upon the hearthrug. Crookshanks purred loudly and ap-
proached the fire, trying, despite the heat, to put his face close to
Sirius’s.
“How’re things?” said Sirius.
“Not that good,” said Harry, as Hermione pulled Crookshanks
back to stop him singeing his whiskers. “The Ministry’s forced
through another decree, which means we’re not allowed to have Quid-
ditch teams —”
“— or secret Defense Against the Dark Arts groups?” said Sirius.
There was a short pause.
“How did you know about that?” Harry demanded.
“You want to choose your meeting places more carefully,” said Sir-
ius, grinning still more broadly. “The Hog’s Head, I ask you . . .”

369
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
“Well, it was better than the Three Broomsticks!” said Hermione
defensively. “That’s always packed with people —”
“— which means you’d have been harder to overhear,” said Sirius.
“You’ve got a lot to learn, Hermione.”
“Who overheard us?” Harry demanded.
“Mundungus, of course,” said Sirius, and when they all looked
puzzled he laughed. “He was the witch under the veil.”
“That was Mundungus?” Harry said, stunned. “What was he doing
in the Hog’s Head?”
“What do you think he was doing?” said Sirius impatiently. “Keep-
ing an eye on you, of course.”
“I’m still being followed?” asked Harry angrily.
“Yeah, you are,” said Sirius, “and just as well, isn’t it, if the first
thing you’re going to do on your weekend off is organize an illegal de-
fense group.”
But he looked neither angry nor worried; on the contrary, he was
looking at Harry with distinct pride.
“Why was Dung hiding from us?” asked Ron, sounding disap-
pointed. “We’d’ve liked to’ve seen him.”
“He was banned from the Hog’s Head twenty years ago,” said Sirius,
“and that barman’s got a long memory. We lost Moody’s spare Invisi-
bility Cloak when Sturgis was arrested, so Dung’s been dressing as a
witch a lot lately. . . . Anyway . . . First of all, Ron — I’ve sworn to
pass on a message from your mother.”
“Oh yeah?” said Ron, sounding apprehensive.
“She says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an ille-
gal secret Defense Against the Dark Arts group. She says you’ll be ex-
pelled for sure and your future will be ruined. She says there will be
plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are
too young to be worrying about that right now. She also” — Sirius’s
eyes turned to the other two — “advises Harry and Hermione not to
proceed with the group, though she accepts that she has no authority

over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has
their best interests at heart. She would have written all this to you, but
if the owl had been intercepted you’d all have been in real trouble, and
she can’t say it for herself because she’s on duty tonight.”
“On duty doing what?” said Ron quickly.
“Never you mind, just stuff for the Order,” said Sirius. “So it’s
fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her I passed it
all on, because I don’t think she trusts me to.”
There was another pause in which Crookshanks, mewing, at-
tempted to paw Sirius’s head, and Ron fiddled with a hole in the
hearthrug.
“So you want me to say I’m not going to take part in the defense
group?” he muttered finally.
“Me? Certainly not!” said Sirius, looking surprised. “I think it’s an
excellent idea!”
“You do?” said Harry, his heart lifting.
“Of course I do!” said Sirius. “D’you think your father and I
would’ve lain down and taken orders from an old hag like Umbridge?”
“But — last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take
risks —”
“Last year all the evidence was that someone inside Hogwarts was
trying to kill you, Harry!” said Sirius impatiently. “This year we know
that there’s someone outside Hogwarts who’d like to kill us all, so I
think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea!”
“And if we do get expelled?” Hermione asked, a quizzical look on
her face.
“Hermione, this whole thing was your idea!” said Harry, staring at
her.
“I know it was. . . . I just wondered what Sirius thought,” she said,
shrugging.
“Well, better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting
safely in school without a clue,” said Sirius.

“Hear, hear,” said Harry and Ron enthusiastically.
“So,” said Sirius, “how are you organizing this group? Where are
you meeting?”
“Well, that’s a bit of a problem now,” said Harry. “Dunno where
we’re going to be able to go. . . .”
“How about the Shrieking Shack?” suggested Sirius.
“Hey, that’s an idea!” said Ron excitedly, but Hermione made a
skeptical noise and all three of them looked at her, Sirius’s head turn-
ing in the flames.
“Well, Sirius, it’s just that there were only four of you meeting in the
Shrieking Shack when you were at school,” said Hermione, “and all of
you could transform into animals and I suppose you could all have
squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if you’d wanted to. But there
are twenty-eight of us and none of us is an Animagus, so we wouldn’t
need so much an Invisibility Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee —”
“Fair point,” said Sirius, looking slightly crestfallen. “Well, I’m sure
you’ll come up with somewhere. . . . There used to be a pretty roomy
secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor, you
might have enough space to practice jinxes in there —”
“Fred and George told me it’s blocked,” said Harry, shaking his
head. “Caved in or something.”
“Oh . . .” said Sirius, frowning. “Well, I’ll have a think and get
back to —”
He broke off. His face was suddenly tense, alarmed. He turned
sideways, apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fireplace.
“Sirius?” said Harry anxiously.
But he had vanished. Harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then
turned to look at Ron and Hermione.
“Why did he — ?”
Hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet, still staring at
the fire.

A hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as though to
catch hold of something; a stubby, short-fingered hand covered in
ugly old-fashioned rings. . . .
The three of them ran for it; at the door of the boys’ dormitory
Harry looked back. Umbridge’s hand was still making snatching
movements amongst the flames, as though she knew exactly where
Sirius’s hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it.

U
mbridge has been reading your mail, Harry. There’s no other
explanation.”
“You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig?” he said, outraged.
“I’m almost certain of it,” said Hermione grimly. “Watch your frog,
it’s escaping.”
Harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping
hopefully toward the other side of the table — “Accio!”— and it
zoomed gloomily back into his hand.
Charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a pri-
vate chat: There was generally so much movement and activity that
the danger of being overheard was very slight. Today, with the room
full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy down-
pour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows,
Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s whispered discussion about how Um-
bridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed.
“I’ve been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering
Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie,” Hermione whis-
pered. “I mean, once your letter had been read, it would have been

374
DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY
quite clear you weren’t ordering them, so you wouldn’t have been in
trouble at all — it’s a bit of a feeble joke, isn’t it? But then I thought,
what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? Well then,
it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it — tip off Filch,
let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a
way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it — I don’t think
Filch would object, when’s he ever stuck up for a student’s rights?
Harry, you’re squashing your frog.”
Harry looked down; he was indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly
its eyes were popping; he replaced it hastily upon the desk.
“It was a very, very close call last night,” said Hermione. “I just
wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was. Silencio!”
The bullfrog on which she was practicing her Silencing Charm was
struck dumb mid-croak and glared at her reproachfully.
“If she’d caught Snuffles . . .”
Harry finished the sentence for her.
“He’d probably be back in Azkaban this morning.” He waved his
wand without really concentrating; his bullfrog swelled like a green
balloon and emitted a high-pitched whistle.
“Silencio!” said Hermione hastily, pointing her wand at Harry’s
frog, which deflated silently before them. “Well, he mustn’t do it
again, that’s all. I just don’t know how we’re going to let him know. We
can’t send him an owl.”
“I don’t reckon he’ll risk it again,” said Ron. “He’s not stupid, he
knows she nearly got him. Silencio!”
The large and ugly raven in front of him let out a derisive caw.
“Silencio! SILENCIO !”
The raven cawed more loudly.
“It’s the way you’re moving your wand,” said Hermione, watching
Ron critically. “You don’t want to wave it, it’s more a sharp jab.”
“Ravens are harder than frogs,” said Ron testily.
“Fine, let’s swap,” said Hermione, seizing Ron’s raven and replacing

375
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
it with her own fat bullfrog. “Silencio!” The raven continued to open
and close its sharp beak, but no sound came out.
“Very good, Miss Granger!” said Professor Flitwick’s squeaky little
voice and Harry, Ron, and Hermione all jumped. “Now, let me see
you try, Mr. Weasley!”
“Wha — ? Oh — oh, right,” said Ron, very flustered. “Er — Silencio!”
He jabbed at the bullfrog so hard that he poked it in the eye; the
frog gave a deafening croak and leapt off the desk.
It came as no surprise to any of them that Harry and Ron were
given additional practice of the Silencing Charm for homework.
They were allowed to remain inside over break due to the down-
pour outside. They found seats in a noisy and overcrowded classroom
on the first floor in which Peeves was floating dreamily up near the
chandelier, occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of somebody’s
head. They had barely sat down when Angelina came struggling to-
ward them through the groups of gossiping students.
“I’ve got permission!” she said. “To re-form the Quidditch team!”
“Excellent!” said Ron and Harry together.
“Yeah,” said Angelina, beaming. “I went to McGonagall and I think
she might have appealed to Dumbledore — anyway, Umbridge had
to give in. Ha! So I want you down at the pitch at seven o’clock
tonight, all right, because we’ve got to make up time, you realize we’re
only three weeks away from our first match?”
She squeezed away from them, narrowly dodged an ink pellet from
Peeves, which hit a nearby first year instead, and vanished from sight.
Ron’s smile slipped slightly as he looked out of the window, which
was now opaque with hammering rain.
“Hope this clears up . . . What’s up with you, Hermione?”
She too was gazing at the window, but not as though she really saw
it. Her eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on her face.
“Just thinking . . .” she said, still frowning at the rain-washed
window.

376
DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY
“About Siri . . . Snuffles?” said Harry.
“No . . . not exactly . . .” said Hermione slowly. “More . . . won-
dering . . . I suppose we’re doing the right thing . . . I think . . . aren’t
we?
Harry and Ron looked at each other.
“Well, that clears that up,” said Ron. “It would’ve been really an-
noying if you hadn’t explained yourself properly.”
Hermione looked at him as though she had only just realized he
was there.
“I was just wondering,” she said, her voice stronger now, “whether
we’re doing the right thing, starting this Defense Against the Dark
Arts group.”
“What!” said Harry and Ron together.
“Hermione, it was your idea in the first place!” said Ron
indignantly.
“I know,” said Hermione, twisting her fingers together. “But after
talking to Snuffles . . .”
“But he’s all for it!” said Harry.
“Yes,” said Hermione, staring at the window again. “Yes, that’s
what made me think maybe it wasn’t a good idea after all. . . .”
Peeves floated over them on his stomach, peashooter at the ready;
automatically all three of them lifted their bags to cover their heads
until he had passed.
“Let’s get this straight,” said Harry angrily, as they put their bags
back on the floor, “Sirius agrees with us, so you don’t think we should
do it anymore?”
Hermione looked tense and rather miserable. Now staring at her
own hands she said, “Do you honestly trust his judgment?”
“Yes, I do!” said Harry at once. “He’s always given us great advice!”
An ink pellet whizzed past them, striking Katie Bell squarely in
the ear. Hermione watched Katie leap to her feet and start throw-
ing things at Peeves; it was a few moments before Hermione spoke

377
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
again and it sounded as though she was choosing her words very
carefully.
“You don’t think he has become . . . sort of . . . reckless . . . since
he’s been cooped up in Grimmauld Place? You don’t think he’s . . .
kind of . . . living through us?”
“What d’you mean, ‘living through us’?” Harry retorted.
“I mean . . . well, I think he’d love to be forming secret defense
societies right under the nose of someone from the Ministry. . . . I
think he’s really frustrated at how little he can do where he is . . . so
I think he’s keen to kind of . . . egg us on.”
Ron looked utterly perplexed.
“Sirius is right,” he said, “you do sound just like my mother.”
Hermione bit her lip and did not answer. The bell rang just as
Peeves swooped down upon Katie and emptied an entire ink bottle
over her head.
The weather did not improve as the day wore on, so that at seven
o’clock that evening, when Harry and Ron went down to the Quid-
ditch pitch for practice, they were soaked through within minutes,
their feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass. The sky was a deep,
thundery gray and it was a relief to gain the warmth and light of the
changing rooms, even if they knew the respite was only temporary.
They found Fred and George debating whether to use one of their
own Skiving Snackboxes to get out of flying.
“— but I bet she’d know what we’d done,” Fred said out of the cor-
ner of his mouth. “If only I hadn’t offered to sell her some Puking
Pastilles yesterday —”
“We could try the Fever Fudge,” George muttered, “no one’s seen
that yet —”
“Does it work?” inquired Ron hopefully, as the hammering of rain
on the roof intensified and wind howled around the building.
“Well, yeah,” said Fred, “your temperature’ll go right up —”

378
DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY
“— but you get these massive pus-filled boils too,” said George,
“and we haven’t worked out how to get rid of them yet.”
“I can’t see any boils,” said Ron, staring at the twins.
“No, well, you wouldn’t,” said Fred darkly, “they’re not in a place
we generally display to the public —”
“— but they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the —”
“All right, everyone, listen up,” said Angelina loudly, emerging
from the Captain’s office. “I know it’s not ideal weather, but there’s a
good chance we’ll be playing Slytherin in conditions like this so it’s a
good idea to work out how we’re going to cope with them. Harry,
didn’t you do something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them
up when we played Hufflepuff in that storm?”
“Hermione did it,” said Harry. He pulled out his wand, tapped his
glasses and said, “Impervius!”
“I think we all ought to try that,” said Angelina. “If we could just
keep the rain off our faces it would really help visibility — all to-
gether, come on — Impervius! Okay. Let’s go.”
They all stowed their wands back in the inside pockets of their
robes, shouldered their brooms, and followed Angelina out of the
changing rooms.
They squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the
pitch; visibility was still very poor even with the Impervius Charm;
light was fading fast and curtains of rain were sweeping the grounds.
“All right, on my whistle,” shouted Angelina.
Harry kicked off from the ground, spraying mud in all directions,
and shot upward, the wind pulling him slightly off course. He had no
idea how he was going to see the Snitch in this weather; he was hav-
ing enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were
practicing; a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he
had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it. Unfortunately Angelina did
not see this; in fact, she did not appear to be able to see anything;
none of them had a clue what the others were doing. The wind was

379
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
picking up; even at a distance Harry could hear the swishing, pound-
ing sounds of the rain pummeling the surface of the lake.
Angelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before conceding de-
feat. She led her sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing
rooms, insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time, though
without any real conviction in her voice. Fred and George were look-
ing particularly annoyed; both were bandy-legged and winced with
every movement. Harry could hear them complaining in low voices as
he toweled his hair dry.
“I think a few of mine have ruptured,” said Fred in a hollow voice.
“Mine haven’t,” said George, wincing. “They’re throbbing like mad
. . . feel bigger if anything . . .”
“OUCH!” said Harry.
He pressed the towel to his face, his eyes screwed tight with pain.
The scar on his forehead had seared again, more painfully than in
months.
“What’s up?” said several voices.
Harry emerged from behind his towel; the changing room was
blurred because he was not wearing his glasses; but he could still tell
that everyone’s face was turned toward him.
“Nothing,” he muttered, “I — poked myself in the eye, that’s
all. . . .”
But he gave Ron a significant look and the two of them hung back
as the rest of the team filed back outside, muffled in their cloaks, their
hats pulled low over their ears.
“What happened?” said Ron, the moment that Alicia had disap-
peared through the door. “Was it your scar?”
Harry nodded.
“But . . .” Looking scared, Ron strode across to the window and
stared out into the rain, “He — he can’t be near us now, can he?”
“No,” Harry muttered, sinking onto a bench and rubbing his

380
DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY
forehead. “He’s probably miles away. It hurt because . . . he’s . . .
angry.”
Harry had not meant to say that at all, and heard the words as
though a stranger had spoken them — yet he knew at once that they
were true. He did not know how he knew it, but he did; Voldemort,
wherever he was, whatever he was doing, was in a towering temper.
“Did you see him?” said Ron, looking horrified. “Did you . . . get a
vision, or something?”
Harry sat quite still, staring at his feet, allowing his mind and his
memory to relax in the aftermath of the pain. . . .
A confused tangle of shapes, a howling rush of voices . . .
“He wants something done, and it’s not happening fast enough,”
he said.
Again, he felt surprised to hear the words coming out of his mouth,
and yet quite certain that they were true.
“But . . . how do you know?” said Ron.
Harry shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands, pressing
down upon them with his palms. Little stars erupted in them. He felt
Ron sit down on the bench beside him and knew Ron was staring at
him.
“Is this what it was about last time?” said Ron in a hushed voice.
“When your scar hurt in Umbridge’s office? You-Know-Who was
angry?”
Harry shook his head.
“What is it, then?”
Harry was thinking himself back. He had been looking into Um-
bridge’s face. . . . His scar had hurt . . . and he had had that odd feel-
ing in his stomach . . . a strange, leaping feeling . . . a happy feeling.
. . . But, of course, he had not recognized it for what it was, as he had
been feeling so miserable himself. . . .
“Last time, it was because he was pleased,” he said. “Really pleased.

381
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
He thought . . . something good was going to happen. And the night
before we came back to Hogwarts . . .” He thought back to the mo-
ment when his scar had hurt so badly in his and Ron’s bedroom in
Grimmauld Place. “He was furious. . . .”
He looked around at Ron, who was gaping at him.
“You could take over from Trelawney, mate,” he said in an awed
voice.
“I’m not making prophecies,” said Harry.
“No, you know what you’re doing?” Ron said, sounding both scared
and impressed. “Harry, you’re reading You-Know-Who’s mind. . . .”
“No,” said Harry, shaking his head. “It’s more like . . . his mood, I
suppose. I’m just getting flashes of what mood he’s in. . . . Dumble-
dore said something like this was happening last year. . . . He said that
when Voldemort was near me, or when he was feeling hatred, I could
tell. Well, now I’m feeling it when he’s pleased too. . . .”
There was a pause. The wind and rain lashed at the building.
“You’ve got to tell someone,” said Ron.
“I told Sirius last time.”
“Well, tell him about this time!”
“Can’t, can I?” said Harry grimly. “Umbridge is watching the owls
and the fires, remember?”
“Well then, Dumbledore —”
“I’ve just told you, he already knows,” said Harry shortly, getting to
his feet, taking his cloak off his peg, and swinging it around himself.
“There’s no point telling him again.”
Ron did up the fastening of his own cloak, watching Harry
thoughtfully.
“Dumbledore’d want to know,” he said.
Harry shrugged.
“C’mon . . . we’ve still got Silencing Charms to practice . . .”
They hurried back through the dark grounds, sliding and stum-
bling up the muddy lawns, not talking. Harry was thinking hard.

382
DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY
What was it that Voldemort wanted done that was not happening
quickly enough?
“He’s got other plans . . . plans he can put into operation very quietly
indeed . . . stuff he can only get by stealth . . . like a weapon. Something
he didn’t have last time.”
He had not thought about those words in weeks; he had been too
absorbed in what was going on at Hogwarts, too busy dwelling on the
ongoing battles with Umbridge, the injustice of all the Ministry inter-
ference. . . . But now they came back to him and made him wonder.
. . . Voldemort’s anger would make sense if he was no nearer laying
hands on the weapon, whatever it was. . . . Had the Order thwarted
him, stopped him from seizing it? Where was it kept? Who had it now?
“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” said Ron’s voice and Harry came back to
his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the
common room.
It appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early, leaving Crook-
shanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly, knitted
elf hats lying on a table by the fire. Harry was rather grateful that she
was not around because he did not much want to discuss his scar
hurting and have her urge him to go to Dumbledore too. Ron kept
throwing him anxious glances, but Harry pulled out his Potions book
and set to work to finish his essay, though he was only pretending to
concentrate and, by the time that Ron said he was going to bed too,
had written hardly anything.
Midnight came and went while Harry was reading and rereading a
passage about the uses of scurvy-grass, lovage, and sneezewort and not
taking in a word of it. . . .
These plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and
are therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts, where
the wizard is desirous of producing hot-headedness and recklessness. . . .
. . . Hermione said Sirius was becoming reckless cooped up in
Grimmauld Place. . . .

383
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
. . . moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and are therefore
much used . . .
. . . the Daily Prophet would think his brain was inflamed if they
found out that he knew what Voldemort was feeling . . .
. . . therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts . . .
. . . confusing was the word, all right; why did he know what Volde-
mort was feeling? What was this weird connection between them,
which Dumbledore had never been able to explain satisfactorily?
. . . where the wizard is desirous . . .
. . . how he would like to sleep . . .
. . . of producing hot-headedness . . .
. . . It was warm and comfortable in his armchair before the fire,
with the rain still beating heavily on the windowpanes and Crook-
shanks purring and the crackling of the flames. . . .
The book slipped from Harry’s slack grip and landed with a dull
thud on the hearthrug. His head fell sideways. . . .
He was walking once more along a windowless corridor, his foot-
steps echoing in the silence. As the door at the end of the passage
loomed larger his heart beat fast with excitement. . . . If he could only
open it . . . enter beyond . . .
He stretched out his hand. . . . His fingertips were inches from it. . . .
“Harry Potter, sir!”
He awoke with a start. The candles had all been extinguished in the
common room, but there was something moving close by.
“Whozair?” said Harry, sitting upright in his chair. The fire was al-
most extinguished, the room very dark.
“Dobby has your owl, sir!” said a squeaky voice.
“Dobby?” said Harry thickly, peering through the gloom toward
the source of the voice.
Dobby the house-elf was standing beside the table on which
Hermione had left her half a dozen knitted hats. His large, pointed
ears were now sticking out from beneath what looked like all the hats

384
DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY
that Hermione had ever knitted; he was wearing one on top of the
other, so that his head seemed elongated by two or three feet, and on
the very topmost bobble sat Hedwig, hooting serenely and obviously
cured.
“Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potter’s owl!” said the elf
squeakily, with a look of positive adoration on his face. “Professor
Grubbly-Plank says she is all well now, sir!”
He sank into a deep bow so that his pencil-like nose brushed the
threadbare surface of the hearthrug and Hedwig gave an indignant
hoot and fluttered onto the arm of Harry’s chair.
“Thanks, Dobby!” said Harry, stroking Hedwig’s head and blinking
hard, trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream. . . .
It had been very vivid. . . . Looking back at Dobby, he noticed that the
elf was also wearing several scarves and innumerable socks, so that his
feet looked far too big for his body.
“Er . . . have you been taking all the clothes Hermione’s been leav-
ing out?”
“Oh no, sir,” said Dobby happily, “Dobby has been taking some for
Winky too, sir.”
“Yeah, how is Winky?” asked Harry.
Dobby’s ears drooped slightly.
“Winky is still drinking lots, sir,” he said sadly, his enormous round
green eyes, large as tennis balls, downcast. “She still does not care for
clothes, Harry Potter. Nor do the other house-elves. None of them
will clean Gryffindor Tower anymore, not with the hats and socks hid-
den everywhere, they finds them insulting, sir. Dobby does it all him-
self, sir, but Dobby does not mind, sir, for he always hopes to meet
Harry Potter and tonight, sir, he has got his wish!” Dobby sank into a
deep bow again. “But Harry Potter does not seem happy,” Dobby
went on, straightening up again and looking timidly at Harry.
“Dobby heard him muttering in his sleep. Was Harry Potter having
bad dreams?”

385
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
“Not really bad,” said Harry, yawning and rubbing his eyes. “I’ve
had worse.”
The elf surveyed Harry out of his vast, orblike eyes. Then he said
very seriously, his ears drooping, “Dobby wishes he could help Harry
Potter, for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much, much
happier now. . . .”
Harry smiled.
“You can’t help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer. . . .”
He bent and picked up his Potions book. He’d have to try and fin-
ish the essay tomorrow. He closed the book and as he did so the fire-
light illuminated the thin white scars on the back of his hand — the
result of his detention with Umbridge.
“Wait a moment — there is something you can do for me, Dobby,”
said Harry slowly.
The elf looked around, beaming.
“Name it, Harry Potter, sir!”
“I need to find a place where twenty-eight people can practice De-
fense Against the Dark Arts without being discovered by any of the
teachers. Especially,” Harry clenched his hand on the book, so that
the scars shone pearly white, “Professor Umbridge.”
He expected the elf ’s smile to vanish, his ears to droop; he expected
him to say that this was impossible, or else that he would try, but his
hopes were not high. . . . What he had not expected was for Dobby to
give a little skip, his ears waggling happily, and clap his hands together.
“Dobby knows the perfect place, sir!” he said happily. “Dobby
heard tell of it from the other house-elves when he came to Hogwarts,
sir. It is known by us as the Come and Go Room, sir, or else as the
Room of Requirement!”
“Why?” said Harry curiously.
“Because it is a room that a person can only enter,” said Dobby se-
riously, “when they have real need of it. Sometimes it is there, and
sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the

386
DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY
seeker’s needs. Dobby has used it, sir,” said the elf, dropping his voice
and looking guilty, “when Winky has been very drunk. He has hidden
her in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to
butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her on while she
sleeps it off, sir. . . . And Dobby knows Mr. Filch has found extra
cleaning materials there when he has run short, sir, and —”
“— and if you really needed a bathroom,” said Harry, suddenly re-
membering something Dumbledore had said at the Yule Ball the pre-
vious Christmas, “would it fill itself with chamber pots?”
“Dobby expects so, sir,” said Dobby, nodding earnestly. “It is a
most amazing room, sir.”
“How many people know about it?” said Harry, sitting up straighter
in his chair.
“Very few, sir. Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it,
sir, but often they never finds it again, for they do not know that it is
always there waiting to be called into service, sir.”
“It sounds brilliant,” said Harry, his heart racing. “It sounds per-
fect, Dobby. When can you show me where it is?”
“Anytime, Harry Potter, sir,” said Dobby, looking delighted at
Harry’s enthusiasm. “We could go now, if you like!”
For a moment Harry was tempted to go now; he was halfway out
of his seat, intending to hurry upstairs for his Invisibility Cloak when,
not for the first time, a voice very much like Hermione’s whispered in
his ear: reckless. It was, after all, very late, he was exhausted and had
Snape’s essay to finish.
“Not tonight, Dobby,” said Harry reluctantly, sinking back into his
chair. “This is really important. . . . I don’t want to blow it, it’ll need
proper planning. . . . Listen, can you just tell me exactly where this
Room of Requirement is and how to get in there?”
Their robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across
the flooded vegetable patch to double Herbology, where they could


CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
hardly hear what Professor Sprout was saying over the hammering of
raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof. The afternoon’s
Care of Magical Creatures lesson was to be relocated from the storm-
swept grounds to a free classroom on the ground floor and, to their
intense relief, Angelina sought out her team at lunch to tell them that
Quidditch practice was canceled.
“Good,” said Harry quietly, when she told him, “because we’ve
found somewhere to have our first Defense meeting. Tonight, eight
o’clock, seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy
being clubbed by those trolls. Can you tell Katie and Alicia?”
She looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others;
Harry returned hungrily to his sausages and mash. When he looked
up to take a drink of pumpkin juice, he found Hermione watching
him.
“What?” he said thickly.
“Well . . . it’s just that Dobby’s plans aren’t always that safe. Don’t
you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm?”
“This room isn’t just some mad idea of Dobby’s; Dumbledore
knows about it too, he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball.”
Hermione’s expression cleared.
“Dumbledore told you about it?”
“Just in passing,” said Harry, shrugging.
“Oh well, that’s all right then,” said Hermione briskly and she
raised no more objections.
Together with Ron they had spent most of the day seeking out
those people who had signed their names to the list in the Hog’s Head
and telling them where to meet that evening. Somewhat to Harry’s
disappointment, it was Ginny who managed to find Cho Chang and
her friend first; however, by the end of dinner he was confident that
the news had been passed to every one of the twenty-five people who
had turned up in the Hog’s Head.
At half-past seven Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the Gryffindor

388
DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY
common room, Harry clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in
his hand. Fifth years were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine
o’clock, but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they
made their way up to the seventh floor.
“Hold it,” said Harry warningly, unfolding the piece of parchment
at the top of the last staircase, tapping it with his wand, and mutter-
ing, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”
A map of Hogwarts appeared upon the blank surface of the parch-
ment. Tiny black moving dots, labeled with names, showed where
various people were.
“Filch is on the second floor,” said Harry, holding the map close to
his eyes and scanning it closely, “and Mrs. Norris is on the fourth.”
“And Umbridge?” said Hermione anxiously.
“In her office,” said Harry, pointing. “Okay, let’s go.”
They hurried along the corridor to the place Dobby had described
to Harry, a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry de-
picting Barnabas the Barmy’s foolish attempt to train trolls for the
ballet.
“Okay,” said Harry quietly, while a moth-eaten troll paused in his
relentless clubbing of the would-be ballet teacher to watch. “Dobby
said to walk past this bit of wall three times, concentrating hard on
what we need.”
They did so, turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank
stretch of wall, then at the man-size vase on its other side. Ron had
screwed up his eyes in concentration, Hermione was whispering
something under her breath, Harry’s fists were clenched as he stared
ahead of him.
We need somewhere to learn to fight. . . . he thought. Just give us a
place to practice . . . somewhere they can’t find us . . .
“Harry,” said Hermione sharply, as they wheeled around after their
third walk past.
A highly polished door had appeared in the wall. Ron was staring

389
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
at it, looking slightly wary. Harry reached out, seized the brass handle,
pulled open the door, and led the way into a spacious room lit with
flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors
below.
The walls were lined with wooden bookcases, and instead of chairs
there were large silk cushions on the floor. A set of shelves at the far
end of the room carried a range of instruments such as Sneakoscopes,
Secrecy Sensors, and a large, cracked Foe-Glass that Harry was sure
had hung, the previous year, in the fake Moody’s office.
“These will be good when we’re practicing Stunning,” said Ron
enthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his foot.
“And just look at these books!” said Hermione excitedly, running a
finger along the spines of the large leather-bound tomes. “A Com-
pendium of Common Curses and Their Counter-Actions . . . The Dark
Arts Outsmarted . . . Self-Defensive Spellwork . . . wow . . .” She looked
around at Harry, her face glowing, and he saw that the presence of
hundreds of books had finally convinced Hermione that what they
were doing was right. “Harry, this is wonderful, there’s everything we
need here!”
And without further ado she slid Jinxes for the Jinxed from its shelf,
sank onto the nearest cushion, and began to read.
There was a gentle knock on the door. Harry looked around;
Ginny, Neville, Lavender, Parvati, and Dean had arrived.
“Whoa,” said Dean, staring around, impressed. “What is this
place?”
Harry began to explain, but before he had finished more people
had arrived, and he had to start all over again. By the time eight
o’clock arrived, every cushion was occupied. Harry moved across to
the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a
satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at him.
Hermione carefully marked her page of Jinxes for the Jinxed and set the
book aside.


“Well,” said Harry, slightly nervously. “This is the place we’ve
found for practices, and you’ve — er — obviously found it okay —”
“It’s fantastic!” said Cho, and several people murmured their
agreement.
“It’s bizarre,” said Fred, frowning around at it. “We once hid from
Filch in here, remember, George? But it was just a broom cupboard
then. . . .”
“Hey, Harry, what’s this stuff?” asked Dean from the rear of the
room, indicating the Sneakoscopes and the Foe-Glass.
“Dark Detectors,” said Harry, stepping between the cushions to
reach them. “Basically they all show when Dark wizards or enemies
are around, but you don’t want to rely on them too much, they can be
fooled. . . .”
He gazed for a moment into the cracked Foe-Glass; shadowy fig-
ures were moving around inside it, though none was recognizable. He
turned his back on it.
“Well, I’ve been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first
and — er —” He noticed a raised hand. “What, Hermione?”
“I think we ought to elect a leader,” said Hermione.
“Harry’s leader,” said Cho at once, looking at Hermione as though
she were mad, and Harry’s stomach did yet another back flip.
“Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly,” said Hermione,
unperturbed. “It makes it formal and it gives him authority. So —
everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader?”
Everybody put up their hands, even Zacharias Smith, though he
did it very halfheartedly.
“Er — right, thanks,” said Harry, who could feel his face burning.
“And — what, Hermione?”
“I also think we ought to have a name,” she said brightly, her hand
still in the air. “It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity,
don’t you think?”
“Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League?” said Angelina hopefully.

391
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
“Or the Ministry of Magic Are Morons Group?” suggested Fred.
“I was thinking,” said Hermione, frowning at Fred, “more of a
name that didn’t tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to
it safely outside meetings.”
“The Defense Association?” said Cho. “The D.A. for short, so no-
body knows what we’re talking about?”
“Yeah, the D.A.’s good,” said Ginny. “Only let’s make it stand for
Dumbledore’s Army because that’s the Ministry’s worst fear, isn’t it?”
There was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at
this.
“All in favor of the D.A.?” said Hermione bossily, kneeling up on
her cushion to count. “That’s a majority — motion passed!”
She pinned the piece of paper with all of their names on it on the
wall and wrote DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY across the top in large
letters.
“Right,” said Harry, when she had sat down again, “shall we get
practicing then? I was thinking, the first thing we should do is Expel-
liarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm. I know it’s pretty basic but
I’ve found it really useful —”
“Oh please,” said Zacharias Smith, rolling his eyes and folding his
arms. “I don’t think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against
You-Know-Who, do you?”
“I’ve used it against him,” said Harry quietly. “It saved my life last
June.”
Smith opened his mouth stupidly. The rest of the room was very
quiet.
“But if you think it’s beneath you, you can leave,” Harry said.
Smith did not move. Nor did anybody else.
“Okay,” said Harry, his mouth slightly drier than usual with all
those eyes upon him, “I reckon we should all divide into pairs and
practice.”
It felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as

392
DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY
seeing them followed. Everybody got to their feet at once and divided
up. Predictably, Neville was left partnerless.
“You can practice with me,” Harry told him. “Right — on the
count of three, then — one, two, three —”
The room was suddenly full of shouts of “Expelliarmus!”: Wands
flew in all directions, missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them
flying into the air. Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went
spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks, and
landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry re-
trieved it with a Summoning Charm. Glancing around he thought he
had been right to suggest that they practice the basics first; there was
a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding
in disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump
backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over
them.
“Expelliarmus!” said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his
wand fly out of his hand.
“I DID IT!” said Neville gleefully. “I’ve never done it before — I
DID IT!”
“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out
that in a real duel situation Neville’s opponent was unlikely to be star-
ing in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side.
“Listen, Neville, can you take it in turns to practice with Ron and
Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how
the rest are doing?”
Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd
was happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth
to disarm Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his
hand, yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not
have to look far for the solution of the mystery, however; Fred and
George were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point
their wands at his back.

393
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye.
“Couldn’t resist . . .”
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who
were doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner;
she was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or un-
willing to jinx her. Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnec-
essarily, giving his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey
brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all
the books leaping off the shelves around them. Luna Lovegood was
similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchley’s wand
spinning out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to
stand on end.
“Okay, stop!” Harry shouted. “Stop! STOP !”
I need a whistle, he thought, and immediately spotted one lying on
top of the nearest row of books. He caught it up and blew hard. Every-
one lowered their wands.
“That wasn’t bad,” said Harry, “but there’s definite room for im-
provement.” Zacharias Smith glared at him. “Let’s try again. . . .”
He moved off around the room again, stopping here and there to
make suggestions. Slowly the general performance improved. He
avoided going near Cho and her friend for a while, but after walking
twice around every other pair in the room felt he could not ignore
them any longer.
“Oh no,” said Cho rather wildly as he approached. “Expelliarmious!
I mean, Expellimellius! I — oh, sorry, Marietta!”
Her curly-haired friend’s sleeve had caught fire; Marietta extin-
guished it with her own wand and glared at Harry as though it was his
fault.
“You made me nervous, I was doing all right before then!” Cho told
Harry ruefully.
“That was quite good,” Harry lied, but when she raised her eye-

394
DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY
brows he said, “Well, no, it was lousy, but I know you can do it prop-
erly, I was watching from over there. . . .”
She laughed. Her friend Marietta looked at them rather sourly and
turned away.
“Don’t mind her,” Cho muttered. “She doesn’t really want to be
here but I made her come with me. Her parents have forbidden her to
do anything that might upset Umbridge, you see — her mum works
for the Ministry.”
“What about your parents?” asked Harry.
“Well, they’ve forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge
too,” said Cho, drawing herself up proudly. “But if they think I’m not
going to fight You-Know-Who after what happened to Cedric —”
She broke off, looking rather confused, and an awkward silence fell
between them; Terry Boot’s wand went whizzing past Harry’s ear and
hit Alicia Spinnet hard on the nose.
“Well, my father is very supportive of any anti-Ministry action!”
said Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry; evidently she
had been eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin Finch-
Fletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had
flown up over his head. “He’s always saying he’d believe anything of
Fudge, I mean, the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated!
And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible
poisons, which he feeds secretly to anybody who disagrees with him.
And then there’s his Umgubular Slashkilter —”
“Don’t ask,” Harry muttered to Cho as she opened her mouth,
looking puzzled. She giggled.
“Hey, Harry,” Hermione called from the other end of the room,
“have you checked the time?”
He looked down at his watch and received a shock — it was al-
ready ten past nine, which meant they needed to get back to their
common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by

395
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Filch for being out-of-bounds. He blew his whistle; everybody
stopped shouting, “Expelliarmus!” and the last couple of wands clat-
tered to the floor.
“Well, that was pretty good,” said Harry, “but we’ve overrun, we’d
better leave it here. Same time, same place next week?”
“Sooner!” said Dean Thomas eagerly and many people nodded in
agreement.
Angelina, however, said quickly, “The Quidditch season’s about to
start, we need team practices too!”
“Let’s say next Wednesday night, then,” said Harry, “and we can
decide on additional meetings then. . . . Come on, we’d better get
going. . . .”
He pulled out the Marauder’s Map again and checked it carefully
for signs of teachers on the seventh floor. He let them all leave in
threes and fours, watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they re-
turned safely to their dormitories: the Hufflepuffs to the basement
corridor that also led to the kitchens, the Ravenclaws to a tower on the
west side of the castle, and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the
seventh floor and the Fat Lady’s portrait.
“That was really, really good, Harry,” said Hermione, when finally
it was just her, Harry, and Ron left.
“Yeah, it was!” said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the
door and watched it melt back into stone behind them. “Did you see
me disarm Hermione, Harry?”
“Only once,” said Hermione, stung. “I got you loads more than
you got me —”
“I did not only get you once, I got you at least three times —”
“Well, if you’re counting the one where you tripped over your own
feet and knocked the wand out of my hand —”
They argued all the way back to the common room, but Harry was
not listening to them. He had one eye on the Marauder’s Map, but he
was also thinking of how Cho had said he made her nervous. . . .


H
arry felt as though he were carrying some kind of talisman
inside his chest over the following two weeks, a glowing se-
cret that supported him through Umbridge’s classes and even made it
possible for him to smile blandly as he looked into her horrible
bulging eyes. He and the D.A. were resisting her under her very nose,
doing the very thing that she and the Ministry most feared, and when-
ever he was supposed to be reading Wilbert Slinkhard’s book during
her lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most re-
cent meetings, remembering how Neville had successfully disarmed
Hermione, how Colin Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx af-
ter three meetings’ hard effort, how Parvati Patil had produced such a
good Reductor Curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the
Sneakoscopes to dust.
He was finding it almost impossible to fix a regular night of the
week for D.A. meetings, as they had to accommodate three separate
Quidditch teams’ practices, which were often rearranged depending on
the weather conditions; but Harry was not sorry about this, he had a
feeling that it was probably better to keep the timing of their meetings

397
CHAPTER NINETEEN
unpredictable. If anyone was watching them, it would be hard to make
out a pattern.
Hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating
the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they
needed to change it at short notice, because it would look so suspi-
cious if people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great
Hall to talk to each other too often. She gave each of the members of
the D.A. a fake Galleon (Ron became very excited when he saw the
basket at first, convinced that she was actually giving out gold).
“You see the numerals around the edge of the coins?” Hermione
said, holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meet-
ing. The coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches.
“On real Galleons that’s just a serial number referring to the goblin
who cast the coin. On these fake coins, though, the numbers will
change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting. The coins will
grow hot when the date changes, so if you’re carrying them in a pocket
you’ll be able to feel them. We take one each, and when Harry sets the
date of the next meeting he’ll change the numbers on his coin, and be-
cause I’ve put a Protean Charm on them, they’ll all change to mimic
his.”
A blank silence greeted Hermione’s words. She looked around at all
the faces upturned to her, rather disconcerted.
“Well — I thought it was a good idea,” she said uncertainly, “I
mean, even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets, there’s
nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon, is there? But . . . well, if you
don’t want to use them . . .”
“You can do a Protean Charm?” said Terry Boot.
“Yes,” said Hermione.
“But that’s . . . that’s N.E.W.T. standard, that is,” he said weakly.
“Oh,” said Hermione, trying to look modest. “Oh . . . well . . . yes,
I suppose it is. . . .”

398
THE LION AND
THE SERPENT
“How come you’re not in Ravenclaw?” he demanded, staring at
Hermione with something close to wonder. “With brains like yours?”
“Well, the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Raven-
claw during my Sorting,” said Hermione brightly, “but it decided on
Gryffindor in the end. So does that mean we’re using the Galleons?”
There was a murmur of assent and everybody moved forward to
collect one from the basket. Harry looked sideways at Hermione.
“You know what these remind me of?”
“No, what’s that?”
“The Death Eaters’ scars. Voldemort touches one of them, and all
their scars burn, and they know they’ve got to join him.”
“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione quietly. “That is where I got the idea
. . . but you’ll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal
rather than on our members’ skin. . . .”
“Yeah . . . I prefer your way,” said Harry, grinning, as he slipped his
Galleon into his pocket. “I suppose the only danger with these is that
we might accidentally spend them.”
“Fat chance,” said Ron, who was examining his own fake Galleon
with a slightly mournful air. “I haven’t got any real Galleons to con-
fuse it with.”
As the first Quidditch match of the season, Gryffindor versus
Slytherin, drew nearer, their D.A. meetings were put on hold because
Angelina insisted on almost daily practices. The fact that the Quid-
ditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the in-
terest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game. The
Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the out-
come, for they, of course, would be playing both teams over the com-
ing year; and the Heads of House of the competing teams, though
they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretense of sportsman-
ship, were determined to see their side’s victory. Harry realized how
much Professor McGonagall cared about beating Slytherin when she

399
CHAPTER NINETEEN
abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the
match.
“I think you’ve got enough to be getting on with at the moment,”
she said loftily. Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked
directly at Harry and Ron and said grimly, “I’ve become accustomed
to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don’t
want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to
practice, won’t you?”
Snape was no less obviously partisan: He had booked the Quid-
ditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had
difficulty getting on it to play. He was also turning a deaf ear to the
many reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor players in the
corridors. When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with
her eyebrows growing so thick and fast that they obscured her vision
and obstructed her mouth, Snape insisted that she must have at-
tempted a Hair-Thickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to
the fourteen eyewitnesses who insisted that they had seen the
Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx
while she worked in the library.
Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindor’s chances; they had, after all,
never lost to Malfoy’s team. Admittedly Ron was still not performing
to Wood’s standard, but he was working extremely hard to improve.
His greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence when he
made a blunder; if he let in one goal he became flustered and was
therefore likely to miss more. On the other hand, Harry had seen Ron
make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form: During one
memorable practice, he had hung one-handed from his broom and
kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the
length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end. The
rest of the team felt this save compared favorably with one made re-
cently by Barry Ryan, the Irish International Keeper, against Poland’s
top Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski. Even Fred had said that Ron might

400
THE LION AND
THE SERPENT
yet make him and George proud, and that they were seriously consid-
ering admitting that he was related to them, something he assured
Ron they had been trying to deny for four years.
The only thing really worrying Harry was how much Ron was al-
lowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to upset him before they even
got onto the pitch. Harry, of course, had endured their snide com-
ments for more than four years, so whispers of, “Hey, Potty, I heard
Warrington’s sworn to knock you off your broom on Saturday,” far
from chilling his blood, made him laugh. “Warrington’s aim’s so pa-
thetic I’d be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me,”
he retorted, which made Ron and Hermione laugh and wiped the
smirk off Pansy Parkinson’s face.
But Ron had never endured a relentless campaign of insults, jeers, and
intimidation. When Slytherins, some of them seventh years and consid-
erably larger than he was, muttered as they passed in the corridors, “Got
your bed booked in the hospital wing, Weasley?” he did not laugh, but
turned a delicate shade of green. When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron
dropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they were within sight of
each other), Ron’s ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he
was likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time too.
October extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving
rain and November arrived, cold as frozen iron, with hard frosts every
morning and icy drafts that bit at exposed hands and faces. The skies
and the ceiling of the Great Hall turned a pale, pearly gray, the moun-
tains around Hogwarts became snowcapped, and the temperature in
the castle dropped so far that many students wore their thick protec-
tive dragon skin gloves in the corridors between lessons.
The morning of the match dawned bright and cold. When Harry
awoke he looked around at Ron’s bed and saw him sitting bolt up-
right, his arms around his knees, staring fixedly into space.
“You all right?” said Harry.
Ron nodded but did not speak. Harry was reminded forcibly of the

401
CHAPTER NINETEEN
time that Ron had accidentally put a slug-vomiting charm on himself.
He looked just as pale and sweaty as he had done then, not to men-
tion as reluctant to open his mouth.
“You just need some breakfast,” Harry said bracingly. “C’mon.”
The Great Hall was filling up fast when they arrived, the talk
louder and the mood more exuberant than usual. As they passed the
Slytherin table there was an upsurge of noise; Harry looked around
and saw that nearly everyone there was wearing, in addition to the
usual green-and-silver scarves and hats, silver badges in the shape of
what seemed to be crowns. For some reason many of them waved at
Ron, laughing uproariously. Harry tried to see what was written on
the badges as he walked by, but he was too concerned to get Ron past
their table quickly to linger long enough to read them.
They received a rousing welcome at the Gryffindor table, where
everyone was wearing red and gold, but far from raising Ron’s spirits
the cheers seemed to sap the last of his morale; he collapsed onto the
nearest bench looking as though he were facing his final meal.
“I must’ve been mental to do this,” he said in a croaky whisper.
“Mental.”
“Don’t be thick,” said Harry firmly, passing him a choice of cereals.
“You’re going to be fine. It’s normal to be nervous.”
“I’m rubbish,” croaked Ron. “I’m lousy. I can’t play to save my life.
What was I thinking?”
“Get a grip,” said Harry sternly. “Look at that save you made with
your foot the other day, even Fred and George said it was brilliant —”
Ron turned a tortured face to Harry.
“That was an accident,” he whispered miserably. “I didn’t mean to
do it — I slipped off my broom when none of you were looking and
I was trying to get back on and I kicked the Quaffle by accident.”
“Well,” said Harry, recovering quickly from this unpleasant sur-
prise, “a few more accidents like that and the game’s in the bag, isn’t it?”

402
THE LION AND
THE SERPENT
Hermione and Ginny sat down opposite them wearing red-and-
gold scarves, gloves, and rosettes.
“How’re you feeling?” Ginny asked Ron, who was now staring into
the dregs of milk at the bottom of his empty cereal bowl as though se-
riously considering attempting to drown himself in them.
“He’s just nervous,” said Harry.
“Well, that’s a good sign, I never feel you perform as well in exams
if you’re not a bit nervous,” said Hermione heartily.
“Hello,” said a vague and dreamy voice from behind them. Harry
looked up: Luna Lovegood had drifted over from the Ravenclaw table.
Many people were staring at her and a few openly laughing and point-
ing; she had managed to procure a hat shaped like a life-size lion’s
head, which was perched precariously on her head.
“I’m supporting Gryffindor,” said Luna, pointing unnecessarily at
her hat. “Look what it does. . . .”
She reached up and tapped the hat with her wand. It opened its
mouth wide and gave an extremely realistic roar that made everyone
in the vicinity jump.
“It’s good, isn’t it?” said Luna happily. “I wanted to have it chewing
up a serpent to represent Slytherin, you know, but there wasn’t time.
Anyway . . . good luck, Ronald!”
She drifted away. They had not quite recovered from the shock of
Luna’s hat before Angelina came hurrying toward them, accompanied
by Katie and Alicia, whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned to
normal by Madam Pomfrey.
“When you’re ready,” she said, “we’re going to go straight down to
the pitch, check out conditions and change.”
“We’ll be there in a bit,” Harry assured her. “Ron’s just got to have
some breakfast.”
It became clear after ten minutes, however, that Ron was not capa-
ble of eating anything more and Harry thought it best to get him

403
CHAPTER NINETEEN
down to the changing rooms. As they rose from the table, Hermione
got up too, and taking Harry’s arm, she drew him to one side.
“Don’t let Ron see what’s on those Slytherins’ badges,” she whis-
pered urgently.
Harry looked questioningly at her, but she shook her head warn-
ingly; Ron had just ambled over to them, looking lost and desperate.
“Good luck, Ron,” said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing
him on the cheek. “And you, Harry —”
Ron seemed to come to himself slightly as they walked back across
the Great Hall. He touched the spot on his face where Hermione had
kissed him, looking puzzled, as though he was not quite sure what had
just happened. He seemed too distracted to notice much around him,
but Harry cast a curious glance at the crown-shaped badges as they
passed the Slytherin table, and this time he made out the words etched
onto them:
tb^pibv
fp=lro=hfkd
With an unpleasant feeling that this could mean nothing good, he
hurried Ron across the entrance hall, down the stone steps, and out
into the icy air.
The frosty grass crunched under their feet as they hurried down the
sloping lawns toward the stadium. There was no wind at all and the
sky was a uniform pearly white, which meant that visibility would be
good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eyes. Harry
pointed out these encouraging factors to Ron as they walked, but he
was not sure that Ron was listening.
Angelina had changed already and was talking to the rest of the
team when they entered. Harry and Ron pulled on their robes (Ron
attempted to do his up back-to-front for several minutes before Alicia

404
THE LION AND
THE SERPENT
took pity on him and went to help) and then sat down to listen to the
pre-match talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder
as the crowd came pouring out of the castle toward the pitch.
“Okay, I’ve only just found out the final lineup for Slytherin,” said
Angelina, consulting a piece of parchment. “Last year’s Beaters, Der-
rick and Bole, have left now, but it looks as though Montague’s re-
placed them with the usual gorillas, rather than anyone who can fly
particularly well. They’re two blokes called Crabbe and Goyle, I don’t
know much about them —”
“We do,” said Harry and Ron together.
“Well, they don’t look bright enough to tell one end of a broom
from another,” said Angelina, pocketing her parchment, “but then I
was always surprised Derrick and Bole managed to find their way
onto the pitch without signposts.”
“Crabbe and Goyle are in the same mold,” Harry assured her.
They could hear hundreds of footsteps mounting the banked
benches of the spectators’ stands now. Some people were singing,
though Harry could not make out the words. He was starting to feel
nervous, but he knew his butterflies were as nothing to Ron’s, who
was clutching his stomach and staring straight ahead again, his jaw set
and his complexion pale gray.
“It’s time,” said Angelina in a hushed voice, looking at her watch.
“C’mon everyone . . . good luck.”
The team rose, shouldered their brooms, and marched in single file
out of the changing room and into the dazzling sunlight. A roar of
sound greeted them in which Harry could still hear singing, though it
was muffled by the cheers and whistles.
The Slytherin team were standing waiting for them. They too were
wearing those silver crown-shaped badges. The new captain, Mon-
tague, was built along the same lines as Dudley, with massive forearms
like hairy hams. Behind him lurked Crabbe and Goyle, almost as
large, blinking stupidly in the sunlight, swinging their new Beaters’


CHAPTER NINETEEN
bats. Malfoy stood to one side, the sunlight gleaming on his white-
blond head. He caught Harry’s eye and smirked, tapping the crown-
shaped badge on his chest.
“Captains shake hands,” ordered the umpire, Madam Hooch, as
Angelina and Montague reached each other. Harry could tell that
Montague was trying to crush Angelina’s fingers, though she did not
wince. “Mount your brooms. . . .”
Madam Hooch placed her whistle in her mouth and blew.
The balls were released and the fourteen players shot upward; out
of the corner of his eye Harry saw Ron streak off toward the goal
hoops. He zoomed higher, dodging a Bludger, and set off on a wide
lap of the pitch, gazing around for a glint of gold; on the other side of
the stadium, Draco Malfoy was doing exactly the same.
“And it’s Johnson, Johnson with the Quaffle, what a player that girl
is, I’ve been saying it for years but she still won’t go out with me —”
“JORDAN!” yelled Professor McGonagall.
“Just a fun fact, Professor, adds a bit of interest — and she’s ducked
Warrington, she’s passed Montague, she’s — ouch — been hit from
behind by a Bludger from Crabbe. . . . Montague catches the Quaffle,
Montague heading back up the pitch and — nice Bludger there from
George Weasley, that’s a Bludger to the head for Montague, he drops
the Quaffle, caught by Katie Bell, Katie Bell of Gryffindor reverse
passes to Alicia Spinnet and Spinnet’s away —”
Lee Jordan’s commentary rang through the stadium and Harry lis-
tened as hard as he could through the wind whistling in his ears and
the din of the crowd, all yelling and booing and singing —
“— dodges Warrington, avoids a Bludger — close call, Alicia —
and the crowd are loving this, just listen to them, what’s that they’re
singing?”
And as Lee paused to listen the song rose loud and clear from the
sea of green and silver in the Slytherin section of the stands:

406
THE LION AND
THE SERPENT
Weasley cannot save a thing,
He cannot block a single ring,
That’s why Slytherins all sing:
Weasley is our King.
Weasley was born in a bin,
He always lets the Quaffle in,
Weasley will make sure we win,
Weasley is our King.
“— and Alicia passes back to Angelina!” Lee shouted, and as Harry
swerved, his insides boiling at what he had just heard, he knew Lee
was trying to drown out the sound of the singing. “Come on now,
Angelina — looks like she’s got just the Keeper to beat! — SHE
SHOOTS — SHE — aaaah . . .”
Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, had saved the goal; he threw the
Quaffle to Warrington who sped off with it, zigzagging in between
Alicia and Katie; the singing from below grew louder and louder as he
drew nearer and nearer Ron —
Weasley is our King,
Weasley is our King,
He always lets the Quaffle in,
Weasley is our King.
Harry could not help himself: Abandoning his search for the Snitch,
he turned his Firebolt toward Ron, a lone figure at the far end of the
pitch, hovering before the three goal hoops while the massive War-
rington pelted toward him . . .
“— and it’s Warrington with the Quaffle, Warrington heading for
goal, he’s out of Bludger range with just the Keeper ahead —”
A great swell of song rose from the Slytherin stands below:

407
CHAPTER NINETEEN
Weasley cannot save a thing,
He cannot block a single ring . . .
“— so it’s the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper, Weasley, brother
of Beaters, Fred and George, and a promising new talent on the
team — come on, Ron!”
But the scream of delight came from the Slytherin end: Ron had
dived wildly, his arms wide, and the Quaffle had soared between
them, straight through Ron’s central hoop.
“Slytherin score!” came Lee’s voice amid the cheering and booing
from the crowds below. “So that’s ten-nil to Slytherin — bad luck,
Ron . . .”
The Slytherins sang even louder:
WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN,
HE ALWAYS LETS THE QUAFFLE IN . . .
“— and Gryffindor back in possession and it’s Katie Bell tanking
up the pitch —” cried Lee valiantly, though the singing was now so
deafening that he could hardly make himself heard above it.
WEASLEY WILL MAKE SURE WE WIN,
WEASLEY IS OUR KING . . .
“Harry, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” screamed Angelina, soaring
past him to keep up with Katie. “GET GOING!”
Harry realized that he had been stationary in midair for more than
a minute, watching the progress of the match without sparing a
thought for the whereabouts of the Snitch; horrified, he went into a
dive and started circling the pitch again, staring around, trying to ig-
nore the chorus now thundering through the stadium:

408
THE LION AND
THE SERPENT
WEASLEY IS OUR KING,
WEASLEY IS OUR KING . . .
There was no sign of the Snitch anywhere he looked; Malfoy was
still circling the stadium just like Harry. They passed midway around
the pitch going in opposite directions and Harry heard Malfoy
singing loudly,
WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN . . .
“— and it’s Warrington again,” bellowed Lee, “who passes to Pucey,
Pucey’s off past Spinnet, come on now Angelina, you can take him —
turns out you can’t — but nice Bludger from Fred Weasley, I mean,
George Weasley, oh who cares, one of them anyway, and Warrington
drops the Quaffle and Katie Bell — er — drops it too — so that’s
Montague with the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Montague takes the
Quaffle, and he’s off up the pitch, come on now Gryffindor, block him!”
Harry zoomed around the end of the stadium behind the Slytherin
goal hoops, willing himself not to look at what was going on at Ron’s
end; as he sped past the Slytherin Keeper, he heard Bletchley singing
along with the crowd below,
WEASLEY CANNOT SAVE A THING . . .
“— and Pucey’s dodged Alicia again, and he’s heading straight for
goal, stop it, Ron!”
Harry did not have to look to see what had happened: There was a
terrible groan from the Gryffindor end, coupled with fresh screams
and applause from the Slytherins. Looking down, Harry saw the pug-
faced Pansy Parkinson right at the front of the stands, her back to the
pitch as she conducted the Slytherin supporters who were roaring:

409
CHAPTER NINETEEN
THAT’S WHY SLYTHERINS ALL SING:
WEASLEY IS OUR KING.
But twenty-nil was nothing, there was still time for Gryffindor to
catch up or catch the Snitch, a few goals and they would be in the lead
as usual, Harry assured himself, bobbing and weaving through the
other players in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be
Montague’s watch strap. . . .
But Ron let in two more goals. There was an edge of panic in
Harry’s desire to find the Snitch now. If he could just get it soon and
finish the game quickly . . .
“— and Katie Bell of Gryffindor dodges Pucey, ducks Montague,
nice swerve, Katie, and she throws to Johnson, Angelina Johnson
takes the Quaffle, she’s past Warrington, she’s heading for goal, come
on now Angelina — GRYFFINDOR SCORE! It’s forty-ten, forty-
ten to Slytherin and Pucey has the Quaffle. . . .”
Harry could hear Luna’s ludicrous lion hat roaring amidst the
Gryffindor cheers and felt heartened; only thirty points in it, that was
nothing, they could pull back easily. Harry ducked a Bludger that
Crabbe had sent rocketing in his direction and resumed his frantic
scouring of the pitch for the Snitch, keeping one eye on Malfoy in
case he showed signs of having spotted it, but Malfoy, like him, was
continuing to soar around the stadium, searching fruitlessly . . .
“— Pucey throws to Warrington, Warrington to Montague, Mon-
tague back to Pucey — Johnson intervenes, Johnson takes the Quaf-
fle, Johnson to Bell, this looks good — I mean bad — Bell’s hit by a
Bludger from Goyle of Slytherin and it’s Pucey in possession
again . . .”
WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN,
HE ALWAYS LETS THE QUAFFLE IN,
WEASLEY WILL MAKE SURE WE WIN —

410
THE LION AND
THE SERPENT
But Harry had seen it at last: The tiny fluttering Golden Snitch was
hovering feet from the ground at the Slytherin end of the pitch.
He dived. . . .
In a matter of seconds, Malfoy was streaking out of the sky on
Harry’s left, a green-and-silver blur lying flat on his broom. . . .
The Snitch skirted the foot of one of the goal hoops and scooted off
toward the other side of the stands; its change of direction suited Mal-
foy, who was nearer. Harry pulled his Firebolt around, he and Malfoy
were now neck and neck . . .
Feet from the ground, Harry lifted his right hand from his broom,
stretching toward the Snitch . . . to his right, Malfoy’s arm extended
too, reaching, groping . . .
It was over in two breathless, desperate, windswept seconds —
Harry’s fingers closed around the tiny, struggling ball — Malfoy’s fin-
gernails scrabbled the back of Harry’s hand hopelessly — Harry
pulled his broom upward, holding the struggling ball in his hand and
the Gryffindor spectators screamed their approval. . . .
They were saved, it did not matter that Ron had let in those goals,
nobody would remember as long as Gryffindor had won —
WHAM!
A Bludger hit Harry squarely in the small of the back and he flew
forward off his broom; luckily he was only five or six feet above the
ground, having dived so low to catch the Snitch, but he was winded
all the same as he landed flat on his back on the frozen pitch. He heard
Madam Hooch’s shrill whistle, an uproar in the stands compounded
of catcalls, angry yells and jeering, a thud, then Angelina’s frantic
voice.
“Are you all right?”
“ ’Course I am,” said Harry grimly, taking her hand and allowing
her to pull him to his feet. Madam Hooch was zooming toward one
of the Slytherin players above him, though he could not see who it
was at this angle.

411
CHAPTER NINETEEN
“It was that thug, Crabbe,” said Angelina angrily. “He whacked the
Bludger at you the moment he saw you’d got the Snitch — but we
won, Harry, we won!”
Harry heard a snort from behind him and turned around, still
holding the Snitch tightly in his hand: Draco Malfoy had landed close
by; white-faced with fury, he was still managing to sneer.
“Saved Weasley’s neck, haven’t you?” he said to Harry. “I’ve never
seen a worse Keeper . . . but then he was born in a bin. . . . Did you
like my lyrics, Potter?”
Harry did not answer; he turned away to meet the rest of the team
who were now landing one by one, yelling and punching the air in tri-
umph, all except Ron, who had dismounted from his broom over by
the goalposts and was making his way slowly back to the changing
rooms alone.
“We wanted to write another couple of verses!” Malfoy called, as
Katie and Alicia hugged Harry. “But we couldn’t find rhymes for fat
and ugly — we wanted to sing about his mother, see —”
“Talk about sour grapes,” said Angelina, casting Malfoy a disgusted
look.
“— we couldn’t fit in useless loser either — for his father, you
know —”
Fred and George had realized what Malfoy was talking about.
Halfway through shaking Harry’s hand they stiffened, looking around
at Malfoy.
“Leave it,” said Angelina at once, taking Fred by the arm. “Leave it,
Fred, let him yell, he’s just sore he lost, the jumped-up little —”
“— but you like the Weasleys, don’t you, Potter?” said Malfoy,
sneering. “Spend holidays there and everything, don’t you? Can’t see
how you stand the stink, but I suppose when you’ve been dragged up
by Muggles even the Weasleys’ hovel smells okay —”
Harry grabbed hold of George; meanwhile it was taking the com-
bined efforts of Angelina, Alicia, and Katie to stop Fred leaping on

412
THE LION AND
THE SERPENT
Malfoy, who was laughing openly. Harry looked around for Madam
Hooch, but she was still berating Crabbe for his illegal Bludger attack.
“Or perhaps,” said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, “you can re-
member what your mother’s house stank like, Potter, and Weasley’s
pigsty reminds you of it —”
Harry was not aware of releasing George, all he knew was that a
second later both of them were sprinting at Malfoy. He had com-
pletely forgotten the fact that all the teachers were watching: All he
wanted to do was cause Malfoy as much pain as possible. With no
time to draw out his wand, he merely drew back the fist clutching the
Snitch and sank it as hard as he could into Malfoy’s stomach —
“Harry! HARRY! GEORGE! NO !”
He could hear girls’ voices screaming, Malfoy yelling, George
swearing, a whistle blowing, and the bellowing of the crowd around
him, but he did not care, not until somebody in the vicinity yelled
“IMPEDIMENTA!” and only when he was knocked over backward by
the force of the spell did he abandon the attempt to punch every inch
of Malfoy he could reach. . . .
“What do you think you’re doing?” screamed Madam Hooch, as
Harry leapt to his feet again; it was she who had hit him with the Im-
pediment Jinx. She was holding her whistle in one hand and a wand
in the other, her broom lay abandoned several feet away. Malfoy was
curled up on the ground, whimpering and moaning, his nose bloody;
George was sporting a swollen lip; Fred was still being forcibly re-
strained by the three Chasers, and Crabbe was cackling in the back-
ground. “I’ve never seen behavior like it — back up to the castle, both
of you, and straight to your Head of House’s office! Go! Now!”
Harry and George marched off the pitch, both panting, neither say-
ing a word to each other. The howling and jeering of the crowd grew
fainter and fainter until they reached the entrance hall, where they
could hear nothing except the sound of their own footsteps. Harry be-
came aware that something was still struggling in his right hand, the

413
CHAPTER NINETEEN
knuckles of which he had bruised against Malfoy’s jaw; looking down
he saw the Snitch’s silver wings protruding from between his fingers,
struggling for release.
They had barely reached the door of Professor McGonagall’s office
when she came marching along the corridor behind them. She was
wearing a Gryffindor scarf, but tore it from her throat with shaking
hands as she strode toward them, looking livid.
“In!” she said furiously, pointing to the door. Harry and George en-
tered. She strode around behind her desk and faced them, quivering
with rage as she threw the Gryffindor scarf aside onto the floor.
“Well ?” she said. “I have never seen such a disgraceful exhibition.
Two onto one! Explain yourselves!”
“Malfoy provoked us,” said Harry stiffly.
“Provoked you?” shouted Professor McGonagall, slamming a fist
onto her desk so that her tartan biscuit tin slid sideways off it and
burst open, littering the floor with Ginger Newts. “He’d just lost,
hadn’t he, of course he wanted to provoke you! But what on earth he
can have said that justified what you two —”
“He insulted my parents,” snarled George. “And Harry’s mother.”
“But instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch to sort out, you two de-
cided to give an exhibition of Muggle dueling, did you?” bellowed
Professor McGonagall. “Have you any idea what you’ve — ?”
“Hem, hem.”
George and Harry both spun around. Dolores Umbridge was
standing in the doorway wrapped in a green tweed cloak that greatly
enhanced her resemblance to a giant toad, and smiling in the horribly
sickly, ominous way that Harry had come to associate with imminent
misery.
“May I help, Professor McGonagall?” asked Professor Umbridge in
her most poisonously sweet voice.
Blood rushed into Professor McGonagall’s face.

414
THE LION AND
THE SERPENT
“Help?” she repeated in a constricted voice. “What do you mean,
‘help’?”
Professor Umbridge moved forward into the office, still smiling her
sickly smile.
“Why, I thought you might be grateful for a little extra authority.”
Harry would not have been surprised to see sparks fly from Profes-
sor McGonagall’s nostrils.
“You thought wrong,” she said, turning her back on Umbridge.
“Now, you two had better listen closely. I do not care what provoca-
tion Malfoy offered you, I do not care if he insulted every family
member you possess, your behavior was disgusting and I am giving
each of you a week’s worth of detention! Do not look at me like that,
Potter, you deserve it! And if either of you ever —”
“Hem, hem.”
Professor McGonagall closed her eyes as though praying for pa-
tience as she turned her face toward Professor Umbridge again.
“Yes?”
“I think they deserve rather more than detentions,” said Umbridge,
smiling still more broadly.
Professor McGonagall’s eyes flew open. “But unfortunately,” she
said, with an attempt at a reciprocal smile that made her look as
though she had lockjaw, “it is what I think that counts, as they are in
my House, Dolores.”
“Well, actually, Minerva,” simpered Umbridge, “I think you’ll find
that what I think does count. Now, where is it? Cornelius just sent it.
. . . I mean,” she gave a little false laugh as she rummaged in her hand-
bag, “the Minister just sent it. . . . Ah yes . . .”
She had pulled out a piece of parchment that she now unfurled,
clearing her throat fussily before starting to read what it said.
“Hem, hem . . . ‘Educational Decree Number Twenty-five . . .’ ”
“Not another one!” exclaimed Professor McGonagall violently.

415
CHAPTER NINETEEN
“Well, yes,” said Umbridge, still smiling. “As a matter of fact, Min-
erva, it was you who made me see that we needed a further amend-
ment. . . . You remember how you overrode me, when I was unwilling
to allow the Gryffindor Quidditch team to re-form? How you took
the case to Dumbledore, who insisted that the team be allowed to
play? Well, now, I couldn’t have that. I contacted the Minister at once,
and he quite agreed with me that the High Inquisitor has to have the
power to strip pupils of privileges, or she — that is to say, I — would
have less authority than common teachers! And you see now, don’t
you, Minerva, how right I was in attempting to stop the Gryffindor
team re-forming? Dreadful tempers . . . Anyway, I was reading out our
amendment . . . hem, hem . . . ‘The High Inquisitor will henceforth
have supreme authority over all punishments, sanctions, and removal
of privileges pertaining to the students of Hogwarts, and the power to
alter such punishments, sanctions, and removals of privileges as may
have been ordered by other staff members. Signed, Cornelius Fudge,
Minister of Magic, Order of Merlin First Class, etc., etc. . . .’ ”
She rolled up the parchment and put it back into her handbag, still
smiling.
“So . . . I really think I will have to ban these two from playing
Quidditch ever again,” she said, looking from Harry to George and
back again.
Harry felt the Snitch fluttering madly in his hand.
“Ban us?” he said, and his voice sounded strangely distant. “From
playing . . . ever again?”
“Yes, Mr. Potter, I think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick,” said
Umbridge, her smile widening still further as she watched him strug-
gle to comprehend what she had said. “You and Mr. Weasley here.
And I think, to be safe, this young man’s twin ought to be stopped
too — if his teammates had not restrained him, I feel sure he would
have attacked young Mr. Malfoy as well. I will want their broomsticks
confiscated, of course; I shall keep them safely in my office, to make

416
THE LION AND
THE SERPENT
sure there is no infringement of my ban. But I am not unreasonable,
Professor McGonagall,” she continued, turning back to Professor
McGonagall who was now standing as still as though carved from ice,
staring at her. “The rest of the team can continue playing, I saw no
signs of violence from any of them. Well . . . good afternoon to you.”
And with a look of the utmost satisfaction Umbridge left the room,
leaving a horrified silence in her wake.
“Banned,” said Angelina in a hollow voice, late that evening in the
common room. “Banned. No Seeker and no Beaters . . . What on
earth are we going to do?”
It did not feel as though they had won the match at all. Everywhere
Harry looked there were disconsolate and angry faces; the team them-
selves were slumped around the fire, all apart from Ron, who had not
been seen since the end of the match.
“It’s just so unfair,” said Alicia numbly. “I mean, what about
Crabbe and that Bludger he hit after the whistle had been blown? Has
she banned him?”
“No,” said Ginny miserably; she and Hermione were sitting on ei-
ther side of Harry. “He just got lines, I heard Montague laughing
about it at dinner.”
“And banning Fred when he didn’t even do anything!” said Alicia
furiously, pummeling her knee with her fist.
“It’s not my fault I didn’t,” said Fred, with a very ugly look on his
face. “I would’ve pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three
hadn’t been holding me back.”
Harry stared miserably at the dark window. Snow was falling. The
Snitch he had caught earlier was now zooming around and around the
common room; people were watching its progress as though hyp-
notized and Crookshanks was leaping from chair to chair, trying to
catch it.
“I’m going to bed,” said Angelina, getting slowly to her feet.

417
CHAPTER NINETEEN
“Maybe this will all turn out to have been a bad dream. . . . Maybe I’ll
wake up tomorrow and find we haven’t played yet. . . .”
She was soon followed by Alicia and Katie. Fred and George sloped
off to bed some time later, glowering at everyone they passed, and
Ginny went not long after that. Only Harry and Hermione were left
beside the fire.
“Have you seen Ron?” Hermione asked in a low voice.
Harry shook his head.
“I think he’s avoiding us,” said Hermione. “Where do you think
he — ?”
But at that precise moment, there was a creaking sound behind
them as the Fat Lady swung forward and Ron came clambering
through the portrait hole. He was very pale indeed and there was
snow in his hair. When he saw Harry and Hermione he stopped dead
in his tracks.
“Where have you been?” said Hermione anxiously, springing up.
“Walking,” Ron mumbled. He was still wearing his Quidditch
things.
“You look frozen,” said Hermione. “Come and sit down!”
Ron walked to the fireside and sank into the chair farthest from
Harry’s, not looking at him. The stolen Snitch zoomed over their
heads.
“I’m sorry,” Ron mumbled, looking at his feet.
“What for?” said Harry.
“For thinking I can play Quidditch,” said Ron. “I’m going to resign
first thing tomorrow.”
“If you resign,” said Harry testily, “there’ll only be three players left
on the team.” And when Ron looked puzzled, he said, “I’ve been
given a lifetime ban. So’ve Fred and George.”
“What?” Ron yelped.
Hermione told him the full story; Harry could not bear to tell it
again. When she had finished, Ron looked more anguished than ever.

418
THE LION AND
THE SERPENT
“This is all my fault —”
“You didn’t make me punch Malfoy,” said Harry angrily.
“— if I wasn’t so lousy at Quidditch —”
“— it’s got nothing to do with that —”
“— it was that song that wound me up —”
“— it would’ve wound anyone up —”
Hermione got up and walked to the window, away from the argu-
ment, watching the snow swirling down against the pane.
“Look, drop it, will you!” Harry burst out. “It’s bad enough with-
out you blaming yourself for everything!”
Ron said nothing but sat gazing miserably at the damp hem of his
robes. After a while he said in a dull voice, “This is the worst I’ve ever
felt in my life.”
“Join the club,” said Harry bitterly.
“Well,” said Hermione, her voice trembling slightly. “I can think of
one thing that might cheer you both up.”
“Oh yeah?” said Harry skeptically.
“Yeah,” said Hermione, turning away from the pitch-black, snow-
flecked window, a broad smile spreading across her face. “Hagrid’s
back.”

HAGRID’S TALE

arry sprinted up to the boys’ dormitory to fetch the Invisi-
bility Cloak and the Marauder’s Map from his trunk; he was
so quick that he and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes be-
fore Hermione hurried back down from the girls’ dormitories, wear-
ing scarf, gloves, and one of her own knobbly elf hats.
“Well, it’s cold out there!” she said defensively, as Ron clicked his
tongue impatiently.
They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves
hastily in the cloak — Ron had grown so much he now needed to
crouch to prevent his feet showing — then, moving slowly and cau-
tiously, they proceeded down the many staircases, pausing at intervals
to check the map for signs of Filch or Mrs. Norris. They were lucky;
they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick, who was gliding along
absentmindedly humming something that sounded horribly like
“Weasley Is Our King.” They crept across the entrance hall and then
out into the silent, snowy grounds. With a great leap of his heart,
Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up
from Hagrid’s chimney. He set off at a quick march, the other two

420
HAGRID’S TALE
jostling and bumping along behind him, and they crunched excitedly
through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden
front door; when Harry raised his fist and knocked three times, a dog
started barking frantically inside.
“Hagrid, it’s us!” Harry called through the keyhole.
“Shoulda known!” said a gruff voice.
They beamed at one another under the cloak; they could tell that
Hagrid’s voice was pleased. “Bin home three seconds . . . Out the way,
Fang . . . Out the way, yeh dozy dog . . .”
The bolt was drawn back, the door creaked open, and Hagrid’s
head appeared in the gap.
Hermione screamed.
“Merlin’s beard, keep it down!” said Hagrid hastily, staring wildly
over their heads. “Under that cloak, are yeh? Well, get in, get in!”
“I’m sorry!” Hermione gasped, as the three of them squeezed past
Hagrid into the house and pulled the cloak off themselves so he could
see them. “I just — oh, Hagrid !”
“It’s nuthin’, it’s nuthin’!” said Hagrid hastily, shutting the door
behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains, but Hermione
continued to gaze up at him in horror.
Hagrid’s hair was matted with congealed blood, and his left eye had
been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple-and-black bruises.
There were many cuts on his face and hands, some of them still bleed-
ing, and he was moving gingerly, which made Harry suspect broken
ribs. It was obvious that he had only just got home; a thick black trav-
eling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough
to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door.
Hagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man and three times as
broad, was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle
over it.
“What happened to you?” Harry demanded, while Fang danced
around them all, trying to lick their faces.

421
CHAPTER TWENTY
“Told yeh, nuthin’,” said Hagrid firmly. “Want a cuppa?”
“Come off it,” said Ron, “you’re in a right state!”
“I’m tellin’ yeh, I’m fine,” said Hagrid, straightening up and turn-
ing to beam at them all, but wincing. “Blimey, it’s good ter see you
three again — had good summers, did yeh?”
“Hagrid, you’ve been attacked!” said Ron.
“Fer the las’ time, it’s nuthin’!” said Hagrid firmly.
“Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound
of mince instead of a face?” Ron demanded.
“You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,” said Hermi-
one anxiously. “Some of those cuts look nasty.”
“I’m dealin’ with it, all righ’?” said Hagrid repressively.
He walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the
middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying
on it. Underneath was a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger
than the average car tire.
“You’re not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid?” said Ron, leaning
in for a closer look. “It looks poisonous.”
“It’s s’posed ter look like that, it’s dragon meat,” Hagrid said. “An’ I
didn’ get it ter eat.”
He picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face.
Greenish blood trickled down into his beard as he gave a soft moan of
satisfaction.
“Tha’s better. It helps with the stingin’, yeh know.”
“So are you going to tell us what’s happened to you?” Harry asked.
“Can’, Harry. Top secret. More’n me job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”
“Did the giants beat you up, Hagrid?” asked Hermione quietly.
Hagrid’s fingers slipped on the dragon steak, and it slid squelchily
onto his chest.
“Giants?” said Hagrid, catching the steak before it reached his belt
and slapping it back over his face. “Who said anythin’ abou’ giants?

422
HAGRID’S TALE
Who yeh bin talkin’ to? Who’s told yeh what I’ve — who’s said I’ve
bin — eh?”
“We guessed,” said Hermione apologetically.
“Oh, yeh did, did yeh?” said Hagrid, fixing her sternly with the eye
that was not hidden by the steak.
“It was kind of . . . obvious,” said Ron. Harry nodded.
Hagrid glared at them, then snorted, threw the steak onto the table
again and strode back to the kettle, which was now whistling.
“Never known kids like you three fer knowin’ more’n yeh oughta,”
he muttered, splashing boiling water into three of his bucket-shaped
mugs. “An’ I’m not complimentin’ yeh, neither. Nosy, some’d call it.
Interferin’.”
But his beard twitched.
“So you have been to look for giants?” said Harry, grinning as he sat
down at the table.
Hagrid set tea in front of each of them, sat down, picked up his
steak again, and slapped it back over his face.
“Yeah, all righ’,” he grunted, “I have.”
“And you found them?” said Hermione in a hushed voice.
“Well, they’re not that difficult ter find, ter be honest,” said Hagrid.
“Pretty big, see.”
“Where are they?” said Ron.
“Mountains,” said Hagrid unhelpfully.
“So why don’t Muggles — ?”
“They do,” said Hagrid darkly. “O’ny their deaths are always put
down ter mountaineerin’ accidents, aren’ they?”
He adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the
bruising.
“Come on, Hagrid, tell us what you’ve been up to!” said Ron. “Tell
us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about be-
ing attacked by the dementors —”

CHAPTER TWENTY
Hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time;
a large quantity of spit, tea, and dragon blood was sprayed over the
table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid, with a soft
splat, onto the floor.
“Whadda yeh mean, attacked by dementors?” growled Hagrid.
“Didn’t you know?” Hermione asked him, wide-eyed.
“I don’ know anything that’s been happenin’ since I left. I was on a
secret mission, wasn’ I, didn’ wan’ owls followin’ me all over the
place — ruddy dementors! Yeh’re not serious?”
“Yeah, I am, they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my
cousin and me, and then the Ministry of Magic expelled me —”
“WHAT?”
“— and I had to go to a hearing and everything, but tell us about
the giants first.”
“You were expelled ?”
“Tell us about your summer and I’ll tell you about mine.”
Hagrid glared at him through his one open eye. Harry looked right
back, an expression of innocent determination on his face.
“Oh, all righ’,” Hagrid said in a resigned voice.
He bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fang’s mouth.
“Oh, Hagrid, don’t, it’s not hygien —” Hermione began, but Ha-
grid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye. He took
another fortifying gulp of tea and then said, “Well, we set off righ’ af-
ter term ended —”
“Madame Maxime went with you, then?” Hermione interjected.
“Yeah, tha’s right,” said Hagrid, and a softened expression appeared
on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green
steak. “Yeah, it was jus’ the pair of us. An’ I’ll tell yeh this, she’s not
afraid of roughin’ it, Olympe. Yeh know, she’s a fine, well-dressed
woman, an’ knowin’ where we was goin’ I wondered ’ow she’d feel
abou’ clamberin’ over boulders an’ sleepin’ in caves an’ tha’, bu’ she
never complained once.”

HAGRID’S TALE
“You knew where you were going?” Harry asked. “You knew where
the giants were?”
“Well, Dumbledore knew, an’ he told us,” said Hagrid.
“Are they hidden?” asked Ron. “Is it a secret, where they are?”
“Not really,” said Hagrid, shaking his shaggy head. “It’s jus’ that
mos’ wizards aren’ bothered where they are, s’ long as it’s a good long
way away. But where they are’s very difficult ter get ter, fer humans
anyway, so we needed Dumbledore’s instructions. Took us abou’ a
month ter get there —”
“A month?” said Ron, as though he had never heard of a journey
lasting such a ridiculously long time. “But — why couldn’t you just
grab a Portkey or something?”
There was an odd expression in Hagrid’s unobscured eye as he
squinted at Ron; it was almost pitying.
“We’re bein’ watched, Ron,” he said gruffly.
“What d’you mean?”
“Yeh don’ understand,” said Hagrid. “The Ministry’s keepin’ an eye
on Dumbledore an’ anyone they reckon’s in league with him, an’ —”
“We know about that,” said Harry quickly, keen to hear the rest
of Hagrid’s story. “We know about the Ministry watching Dumble-
dore —”
“So you couldn’t use magic to get there?” asked Ron, looking thun-
derstruck. “You had to act like Muggles all the way?”
“Well, not exactly all the way,” said Hagrid cagily. “We jus’ had ter
be careful, ’cause Olympe an’ me, we stick out a bit —”
Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff
and hastily took a gulp of tea.
“— so we’re not hard ter follow. We was pretendin’ we was goin’ on
holiday together, so we got inter France an’ we made like we was
headin’ fer where Olympe’s school is, ’cause we knew we was bein’
tailed by someone from the Ministry. We had to go slow, ’cause I’m
not really s’posed ter use magic an’ we knew the Ministry’d be lookin’

fer a reason ter run us in. But we managed ter give the berk tailin’ us
the slip round abou’ Dee-John —”
“Ooooh, Dijon?” said Hermione excitedly. “I’ve been there on hol-
iday, did you see — ?”
She fell silent at the look on Ron’s face.
“We chanced a bit o’ magic after that, and it wasn’ a bad journey.
Ran inter a couple o’ mad trolls on the Polish border, an’ I had a sligh’
disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, but apart from tha’,
couldn’t’a bin smoother.
“An’ then we reached the place, an’ we started trekkin’ up through
the mountains, lookin’ fer signs of ’em . . .
“We had ter lay off the magic once we got near ’em. Partly ’cause they
don’ like wizards an’ we didn’ want ter put their backs up too soon, and
partly ’cause Dumbledore had warned us You-Know-Who was bound
ter be after the giants an’ all. Said it was odds on he’d sent a messenger
off ter them already. Told us ter be very careful of drawin’ attention ter
ourselves as we got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around.”
Hagrid paused for a long draft of tea.
“Go on!” said Harry urgently.
“Found ’em,” said Hagrid baldly. “Went over a ridge one nigh’ an’
there they was, spread ou’ underneath us. Little fires burnin’ below an’
huge shadows . . . It was like watchin’ bits o’ the mountain movin’.”
“How big are they?” asked Ron in a hushed voice.
“ ’Bout twenty feet,” said Hagrid casually. “Some o’ the bigger ones
mighta bin twenty-five.”
“And how many were there?” asked Harry.
“I reckon abou’ seventy or eighty,” said Hagrid.
“Is that all?” said Hermione.
“Yep,” said Hagrid sadly, “eighty left, an’ there was loads once,
musta bin a hundred diff ’rent tribes from all over the world. But
they’ve bin dyin’ out fer ages. Wizards killed a few, o’ course, but

426
HAGRID’S TALE
mostly they killed each other, an’ now they’re dyin’ out faster than
ever. They’re not made ter live bunched up together like tha’. Dumb-
ledore says it’s our fault, it was the wizards who forced ’em to go an’
made ’em live a good long way from us an’ they had no choice but ter
stick together fer their own protection.”
“So,” said Harry, “you saw them and then what?”
“Well, we waited till morning, didn’ want ter go sneakin’ up on ’em
in the dark, fer our own safety,” said Hagrid. “ ’Bout three in the
mornin’ they fell asleep jus’ where they was sittin’. We didn’ dare sleep.
Fer one thing, we wanted ter make sure none of ’em woke up an’
came up where we were, an’ fer another, the snorin’ was unbelievable.
Caused an avalanche near mornin’.
“Anyway, once it was light we wen’ down ter see ’em.”
“Just like that?” said Ron, looking awestruck. “You just walked
right into a giant camp?”
“Well, Dumbledore’d told us how ter do it,” said Hagrid. “Give the
Gurg gifts, show some respect, yeh know.”
“Give the what gifts?” asked Harry.
“Oh, the Gurg — means the chief.”
“How could you tell which one was the Gurg?” asked Ron.
Hagrid grunted in amusement.
“No problem,” he said. “He was the biggest, the ugliest, an’ the
laziest. Sittin’ there waitin’ ter be brought food by the others. Dead
goats an’ such like. Name o’ Karkus. I’d put him at twenty-two,
twenty-three feet, an’ the weight of a couple o’ bull elephants. Skin
like rhino hide an’ all.”
“And you just walked up to him?” said Hermione breathlessly.
“Well . . . down ter him, where he was lyin’ in the valley. They was
in this dip between four pretty high mountains, see, beside a moun-
tain lake, an’ Karkus was lyin’ by the lake roarin’ at the others ter feed
him an’ his wife. Olympe an’ I went down the mountainside —”

427
CHAPTER TWENTY
“But didn’t they try and kill you when they saw you?” asked Ron
incredulously.
“It was def ’nitely on some of their minds,” said Hagrid, shrugging,
“but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do, which was ter hold our
gift up high an’ keep our eyes on the Gurg an’ ignore the others. So
tha’s what we did. An’ the rest of ’em went quiet an’ watched us pass
an’ we got right up ter Karkus’s feet an’ we bowed an’ put our present
down in front o’ him.”
“What do you give a giant?” asked Ron eagerly. “Food?”
“Nah, he can get food all righ’ fer himself,” said Hagrid. “We took
him magic. Giants like magic, jus’ don’t like us usin’ it against ’em.
Anyway, that firs’ day we gave him a branch o’ Gubraithian fire.”
Hermione said “wow” softly, but Harry and Ron both frowned in
puzzlement.
“A branch of — ?”
“Everlasting fire,” said Hermione irritably, “you ought to know that
by now, Professor Flitwick’s mentioned it at least twice in class!”
“Well anyway,” said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could
answer back, “Dumbledore’d bewitched this branch to burn ever-
more, which isn’ somethin’ any wizard could do, an’ so I lies it down
in the snow by Karkus’s feet and says, ‘A gift to the Gurg of the giants
from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his respectful greetings.’ ”
“And what did Karkus say?” asked Harry eagerly.
“Nothin’,” said Hagrid. “Didn’ speak English.”
“You’re kidding!”
“Didn’ matter,” said Hagrid imperturbably, “Dumbledore had
warned us tha’ migh’ happen. Karkus knew enough to yell fer a cou-
ple o’ giants who knew our lingo an’ they translated fer us.”
“And did he like the present?” asked Ron.
“Oh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it
was,” said Hagrid, turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler

side to his swollen eye. “Very pleased. So then I said, ‘Albus Dumble-
dore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns to-
morrow with another gift.’ ”
“Why couldn’t you speak to them that day?” asked Hermione.
“Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow,” said Hagrid. “Let
’em see we kept our promises. We’ll come back tomorrow with another
present, an’ then we do come back with another present — gives a
good impression, see? An’ gives them time ter test out the firs’ present
an’ find out it’s a good one, an’ get ’em eager fer more. In any case, gi-
ants like Karkus — overload ’em with information an’ they’ll kill yeh
jus’ to simplify things. So we bowed outta the way an’ went off an’
found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in, an’ the fol-
lowin’ mornin’ we went back an’ this time we found Karkus sittin’ up
waitin’ fer us lookin’ all eager.”
“And you talked to him?”
“Oh yeah. Firs’ we presented him with a nice battle helmet —
goblin-made an’ indestructible, yeh know — an’ then we sat down an’
we talked.”
“What did he say?”
“Not much,” said Hagrid. “Listened mostly. But there were good
signs. He’d heard o’ Dumbledore, heard he’d argued against the killin’
of the last giants in Britain. Karkus seemed ter be quite int’rested in
what Dumbledore had ter say. An’ a few o’ the others, ’specially the
ones who had some English, they gathered round an’ listened too. We
were hopeful when we left that day. Promised ter come back next day
with another present.
“But that night it all wen’ wrong.”
“What d’you mean?” said Ron quickly.
“Well, like I say, they’re not meant ter live together, giants,” said
Hagrid sadly. “Not in big groups like that. They can’ help themselves,
they half kill each other every few weeks. The men fight each other an’

429
CHAPTER TWENTY
the women fight each other, the remnants of the old tribes fight each
other, an’ that’s even without squabbles over food an’ the best fires an’
sleepin’ spots. Yeh’d think, seein’ as how their whole race is abou’ fin-
ished, they’d lay off each other, but . . .”
Hagrid sighed deeply
“That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our
cave, lookin’ down on the valley. Went on fer hours, yeh wouldn’ be-
lieve the noise. An’ when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an’ his
head was lyin’ at the bottom o’ the lake.”
“Whose head?” gasped Hermione.
“Karkus’s,” said Hagrid heavily. “There was a new Gurg, Golgo-
math.” He sighed deeply. “Well, we hadn’ bargained on a new Gurg
two days after we’d made friendly contact with the firs’ one, an’ we had
a funny feelin’ Golgomath wouldn’ be so keen ter listen to us, but we
had ter try.”
“You went to speak to him?” asked Ron incredulously. “After you’d
watched him rip off another giant’s head?”
“ ’Course we did,” said Hagrid, “we hadn’ gone all that way ter give
up after two days! We wen’ down with the next present we’d meant ter
give ter Karkus.
“I knew it was no go before I’d opened me mouth. He was sitting
there wearin’ Karkus’s helmet, leerin’ at us as we got nearer. He’s mas-
sive, one o’ the biggest ones there. Black hair an’ matchin’ teeth an’ a
necklace o’ bones. Human-lookin’ bones, some of ’em. Well, I gave it
a go — held out a great roll o’ dragon skin — an’ said A gift fer the
Gurg of the giants —’ Nex’ thing I knew, I was hangin’ upside down
in the air by me feet, two of his mates had grabbed me.”
Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth.
“How did you get out of that?” asked Harry.
“Wouldn’ta done if Olympe hadn’ bin there,” said Hagrid. “She
pulled out her wand an’ did some o’ the fastes’ spellwork I’ve ever seen.

Ruddy marvelous. Hit the two holdin’ me right in the eyes with Con-
junctivitus Curses an’ they dropped me straightaway — bu’ we were
in trouble then, ’cause we’d used magic against ’em, an’ that’s what gi-
ants hate abou’ wizards. We had ter leg it an’ we knew there was no
way we was going ter be able ter march inter camp again.”
“Blimey, Hagrid,” said Ron quietly.
“So how come it’s taken you so long to get home if you were only
there for three days?” asked Hermione.
“We didn’ leave after three days!” said Hagrid, looking outraged.
“Dumbledore was relyin’ on us!”
“But you’ve just said there was no way you could go back!”
“Not by daylight, we couldn’, no. We just had ter rethink a bit.
Spent a couple o’ days lyin’ low up in the cave an’ watchin’. An’ wha’
we saw wasn’ good.”
“Did he rip off more heads?” asked Hermione, sounding squeamish.
“No,” said Hagrid. “I wish he had.”
“What d’you mean?”
“I mean we soon found out he didn’ object ter all wizards — just us.”
“Death Eaters?” said Harry quickly.
“Yep,” said Hagrid darkly. “Couple of ’em were visitin’ him ev’ry
day, bringin’ gifts ter the Gurg, an’ he wasn’ dangling them upside
down.”
“How d’you know they were Death Eaters?” said Ron.
“Because I recognized one of ’em,” Hagrid growled. “Macnair, re-
member him? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, he is. Likes
killin’ as much as Golgomath, no wonder they were gettin’ on so well.”
“So Macnair’s persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who?” said
Hermione desperately.
“Hold yer hippogriffs, I haven’ finished me story yet!” said Hagrid
indignantly, who, considering he had not wanted to tell them any-
thing in the first place, now seemed to be rather enjoying himself. “Me

an’ Olympe talked it over an’ we agreed, jus’ ’cause the Gurg looked
like favorin’ You-Know-Who didn’ mean all of ’em would. We had ter
try an’ persuade some o’ the others, the ones who hadn’ wanted Gol-
gomath as Gurg.”
“How could you tell which ones they were?” asked Ron.
“Well, they were the ones bein’ beaten to a pulp, weren’ they?” said
Hagrid patiently. “The ones with any sense were keepin’ outta Golgo-
math’s way, hidin’ out in caves roun’ the gully jus’ like we were. So we
decided we’d go pokin’ round the caves by night an’ see if we couldn’
persuade a few o’ them.”
“You went poking around dark caves looking for giants?” said Ron
with awed respect in his voice.
“Well, it wasn’ the giants who worried us most,” said Hagrid. “We
were more concerned abou’ the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had told us
before we wen’ not ter tangle with ’em if we could avoid it, an’ the trou-
ble was they knew we was around — ’spect Golgomath told him abou’
us. At night when the giants were sleepin’ an’ we wanted ter be creepin’
inter the caves, Macnair an’ the other one were sneakin’ round the
mountains lookin’ fer us. I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin’ out
at them,” said Hagrid, the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard.
“She was rarin’ ter attack ’em. . . . she’s somethin’ when she’s roused,
Olympe. . . . Fiery, yeh know . . . ’spect it’s the French in her . . .”
Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire. Harry allowed him thirty
seconds’ reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly.
“So what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants?”
“What? Oh . . . oh yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after
Karkus was killed, we crept outta the cave we’d bin hidin’ in and
headed back down inter the gully, keepin’ our eyes skinned fer the
Death Eaters. Got inside a few o’ the caves, no go — then, in abou’
the sixth one, we found three giants hidin’.”
“Cave must’ve been cramped,” said Ron.

HAGRID’S TALE
“Wasn’ room ter swing a kneazle,” said Hagrid.
“Didn’t they attack you when they saw you?” asked Hermione.
“Probably woulda done if they’d bin in any condition,” said Ha-
grid, “but they was badly hurt, all three o’ them. Golgomath’s lot had
beaten ’em unconscious; they’d woken up an’ crawled inter the near-
est shelter they could find. Anyway, one o’ them had a bit of English
an’ ’e translated fer the others, an’ what we had ter say didn’ seem ter
go down too badly. So we kep’ goin’ back, visitin’ the wounded. . . . I
reckon we had abou’ six or seven o’ them convinced at one poin’.”
“Six or seven?” said Ron eagerly. “Well that’s not bad — are they
going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us?”
But Hermione said, “What do you mean ‘at one point,’ Hagrid?”
Hagrid looked at her sadly.
“Golgomath’s lot raided the caves. The ones tha’ survived didn’
wan’ no more ter to do with us after that.”
“So . . . so there aren’t any giants coming?” said Ron, looking
disappointed.
“Nope,” said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his
steak again and applied the cooler side to his face, “but we did wha’ we
meant ter do, we gave ’em Dumbledore’s message an’ some o’ them
heard it an’ I ’spect some o’ them’ll remember it. Jus’ maybe, them that
don’ want ter stay around Golgomath’ll move outta the mountains,
an’ there’s gotta be a chance they’ll remember Dumbledore’s friendly
to ’em. . . . Could be they’ll come . . .”
Snow was filling up the window now. Harry became aware that the
knees of his robes were soaked through; Fang was drooling with his
head in Harry’s lap.
“Hagrid?” said Hermione quietly after a while.
“Mmm?”
“Did you . . . was there any sign of . . . did you hear anything about
your . . . your . . . mother while you were there?”

CHAPTER TWENTY
Hagrid’s unobscured eye rested upon her, and Hermione looked
rather scared.
“I’m sorry . . . I . . . forget it —”
“Dead,” Hagrid grunted. “Died years ago. They told me.”
“Oh . . . I’m . . . I’m really sorry,” said Hermione in a very small
voice.
Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders. “No need,” he said shortly.
“Can’ remember her much. Wasn’ a great mother.”
They were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and
Ron, plainly wanting them to speak.
“But you still haven’t explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,”
Ron said, gesturing toward Hagrid’s bloodstained face.
“Or why you’re back so late,” said Harry. “Sirius says Madame
Maxime got back ages ago —”
“Who attacked you?” said Ron.
“I haven’ bin attacked!” said Hagrid emphatically. “I —”
But the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of
rapping on the door. Hermione gasped; her mug slipped through her
fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. All four of them stared
at the window beside the doorway. The shadow of somebody small
and squat rippled across the thin curtain.
“It’s her!” Ron whispered.
“Get under here!” Harry said quickly; seizing the Invisibility Cloak
he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the
table and dived beneath the cloak as well. Huddled together they
backed away into a corner. Fang was barking madly at the door. Ha-
grid looked thoroughly confused.
“Hagrid, hide our mugs!”
Hagrid seized Harry’s and Ron’s mugs and shoved them under
the cushion in Fang’s basket. Fang was now leaping up at the door;
Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open.
Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her

434
HAGRID’S TALE
green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps. Lips pursed, she
leaned back so as to see Hagrid’s face; she barely reached his navel.
“So,” she said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody
deaf. “You’re Hagrid, are you?”
Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room, her
bulging eyes rolling in every direction.
“Get away,” she snapped, waving her handbag at Fang, who had
bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face.
“Er — I don’ want ter be rude,” said Hagrid, staring at her, “but
who the ruddy hell are you?”
“My name is Dolores Umbridge.”
Her eyes were sweeping the cabin. Twice they stared directly into
the corner where Harry stood, sandwiched between Ron and Her-
mione.
“Dolores Umbridge?” Hagrid said, sounding thoroughly confused.
“I thought you were one o’ them Ministry — don’ you work with
Fudge?”
“I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,” said Umbridge,
now pacing around the cabin, taking in every tiny detail within, from
the haversack against the wall to the abandoned traveling cloak. “I am
now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher —”
“Tha’s brave of yeh,” said Hagrid, “there’s not many’d take tha’ job
anymore —”
“— and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,” said Umbridge, giving no sign
that she had heard him.
“Wha’s that?” said Hagrid, frowning.
“Precisely what I was going to ask,” said Umbridge, pointing at the
broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione’s mug.
“Oh,” said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance toward the corner
where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood hidden, “oh, tha’ was . . . was
Fang. He broke a mug. So I had ter use this one instead.”
Hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking, one

hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye. Umbridge
stood facing him now, taking in every detail of his appearance instead
of the cabin’s.
“I heard voices,” she said quietly.
“I was talkin’ ter Fang,” said Hagrid stoutly.
“And was he talking back to you?”
“Well . . . in a manner o’ speakin’,” said Hagrid, looking uncom-
fortable. “I sometimes say Fang’s near enough human —”
“There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the cas-
tle doors to your cabin,” said Umbridge sleekly.
Hermione gasped; Harry clapped a hand over her mouth. Luckily,
Fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of Professor Umbridge’s
robes, and she did not appear to have heard.
“Well, I on’y jus’ got back,” said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand
at the haversack. “Maybe someone came ter call earlier an’ I missed
em.
“There are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door.”
“Well I . . . I don’ know why that’d be. . . .” said Hagrid, tugging
nervously at his beard and again glancing toward the corner where
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood, as though asking for help.
“Erm . . .”
Umbridge wheeled around and strode the length of the cabin,
looking around carefully. She bent and peered under the bed. She
opened Hagrid’s cupboards. She passed within two inches of where
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood pressed against the wall; Harry ac-
tually pulled in his stomach as she walked by. After looking carefully
inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking she wheeled
around again and said, “What has happened to you? How did you
sustain those injuries?”
Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face, which in
Harry’s opinion was a mistake, because the black-and-purple bruising

HAGRID’S TALE
all around his eye was now clearly visible, not to mention the large
amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face. “Oh, I . . . had a bit
of an accident,” he said lamely.
“What sort of accident?”
“I-I tripped.”
“You tripped,” she repeated coolly.
“Yeah, tha’s right. Over . . . over a friends broomstick. I don’ fly,
meself. Well, look at the size o’ me, I don’ reckon there’s a broomstick
that’d hold me. Friend o’ mine breeds Abraxan horses, I dunno if
you’ve ever seen ’em, big beasts, winged, yeh know, I’ve had a bit of a
ride on one o’ them an’ it was —”
“Where have you been?” asked Umbridge, cutting coolly through
Hagrid’s babbling.
“Where’ve I . . . ?”
“Been, yes,” she said. “Term started more than two months ago.
Another teacher has had to cover your classes. None of your colleagues
has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts. You
left no address. Where have you been?”
There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her with his newly un-
covered eye. Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously.
“I — I’ve been away for me health,” he said.
“For your health,” said Umbridge. Her eyes traveled over Hagrid’s
discolored and swollen face; dragon blood dripped gently onto his
waistcoat in the silence. “I see.”
“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “bit o’ — o’ fresh air, yeh know —”
“Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by,” said
Umbridge sweetly. The small patch of Hagrid’s face that was not black
or purple flushed.
“Well — change o’ scene, yeh know —”
“Mountain scenery?” said Umbridge swiftly.
She knows, Harry thought desperately.

437
CHAPTER TWENTY
“Mountains?” Hagrid repeated, clearly thinking fast. “Nope, South
of France fer me. Bit o’ sun an’ . . . an’ sea.”
“Really?” said Umbridge. “You don’t have much of a tan.”
“Yeah . . . well . . . sensitive skin,” said Hagrid, attempting an in-
gratiating smile. Harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked
out. Umbridge looked at him coldly; his smile faltered. Then she
hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said,
“I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.”
“Righ’,” said Hagrid, nodding.
“You ought to know too that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortu-
nate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers. So I daresay we
shall meet again soon enough.”
She turned sharply and marched back to the door.
“You’re inspectin’ us?” Hagrid echoed blankly, looking after her.
“Oh yes,” said Umbridge softly, looking back at him with her hand
on the door handle. “The Ministry is determined to weed out unsat-
isfactory teachers, Hagrid. Good night.”
She left, closing the door behind her with a snap. Harry made to
pull off the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione seized his wrist.
“Not yet,” she breathed in his ear. “She might not be gone yet.”
Hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way; he stumped across the
room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so.
“She’s goin’ back ter the castle,” he said in a low voice. “Blimey . . .
inspectin’ people, is she?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, pulling the cloak off. “Trelawney’s on probation
already. . . .”
“Um . . . what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class,
Hagrid?” asked Hermione.
“Oh, don’ you worry abou’ that, I’ve got a great load o’ lessons
planned,” said Hagrid enthusiastically, scooping up his dragon steak
from the table and slapping it over his eye again. “I’ve bin keepin’ a

438
HAGRID’S TALE
couple o’ creatures saved fer yer O.W.L. year, you wait, they’re some-
thin’ really special.”
“Erm . . . special in what way?” asked Hermione tentatively.
“I’m not sayin’,” said Hagrid happily. “I don’ want ter spoil the
surprise.”
“Look, Hagrid,” said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretense,
“Professor Umbridge won’t be at all happy if you bring anything to
class that’s too dangerous —”
“Dangerous?” said Hagrid, looking genially bemused. “Don’ be
silly, I wouldn’ give yeh anythin’ dangerous! I mean, all righ’, they can
look after themselves —”
“Hagrid, you’ve got to pass Umbridge’s inspection, and to do that
it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after
porlocks, how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs,
stuff like that!” said Hermione earnestly.
“But tha’s not very interestin’, Hermione,” said Hagrid. “The stuff
I’ve got’s much more impressive, I’ve bin bringin’ ’em on fer years, I
reckon I’ve got the on’y domestic herd in Britain —”
“Hagrid . . . please . . .” said Hermione, a note of real desperation
in her voice. “Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teach-
ers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore. Please, Hagrid, teach us
something dull that’s bound to come up in our O.W.L. . . .”
But Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one-eyed look of
longing toward the vast bed in the corner.
“Lis’en, it’s bin a long day an’ it’s late,” he said, patting Hermione
gently on the shoulder, so that her knees gave way and hit the floor
with a thud. “Oh — sorry —” He pulled her back up by the neck of
her robes. “Look, don’ you go worryin’ abou’ me, I promise yeh I’ve
got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I’m back. . . . Now
you lot had better get back up to the castle, an’ don’ forget ter wipe
yer footprints out behind yeh!”

“I dunno if you got through to him,” said Ron a short while later
when, having checked that the coast was clear, they walked back up to
the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind them
due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they
went.
“Then I’ll go back again tomorrow,” said Hermione determinedly.
“I’ll plan his lessons for him if I have to. I don’t care if she throws out
Trelawney but she’s not taking Hagrid!”

H
ermione plowed her way back to Hagrid’s cabin through two
feet of snow on Sunday morning. Harry and Ron wanted to
go with her, but their mountain of homework had reached an alarm-
ing height again, so they grudgingly remained in the common room,
trying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds out-
side, where students were enjoying themselves skating on the frozen
lake, tobogganing, and worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up
to Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows.
“Oy!” bellowed Ron, finally losing patience and sticking his head
out of the window, “I am a prefect and if one more snowball hits this
window — OUCH!”
He withdrew his head sharply, his face covered in snow.
“It’s Fred and George,” he said bitterly, slamming the window be-
hind him. “Gits . . .”
Hermione returned from Hagrid’s just before lunch, shivering
slightly, her robes damp to the knees.
“So?” said Ron, looking up when she entered. “Got all his lessons
planned for him?”

441
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
“Well, I tried,” she said dully, sinking into a chair beside Harry. She
pulled out her wand and gave it a complicated little wave so that hot
air streamed out of the tip; she then pointed this at her robes, which
began to steam as they dried out. “He wasn’t even there when I ar-
rived, I was knocking for at least half an hour. And then he came
stumping out of the forest —”
Harry groaned. The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of
creatures most likely to get Hagrid the sack. “What’s he keeping in
there? Did he say?” asked Harry.
“No,” said Hermione miserably. “He says he wants them to be a
surprise. I tried to explain about Umbridge, but he just doesn’t get it.
He kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study knarls
than chimaeras — oh I don’t think he’s got a chimaera,” she added at
the appalled look on Harry and Ron’s faces, “but that’s not for lack of
trying from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs. . . . I don’t
know how many times I told him he’d be better off following
Grubbly-Plank’s plan, I honestly don’t think he listened to half of
what I said. He’s in a bit of a funny mood, you know. He still won’t
say how he got all those injuries. . . .”
Hagrid’s reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was
not greeted by enthusiasm from all students. Some, like Fred, George,
and Lee, roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the
Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrid’s enormous hand;
others, like Parvati and Lavender, exchanged gloomy looks and shook
their heads. Harry knew that many of them preferred Professor
Grubbly-Plank’s lessons, and the worst of it was that a very small, un-
biased part of him knew that they had good reason: Grubbly-Plank’s
idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that
somebody might have their head ripped off.
It was with a certain amount of apprehension that Harry, Ron, and
Hermione headed down to Hagrid’s on Tuesday, heavily muffled
against the cold. Harry was worried, not only about what Hagrid

442
THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
might have decided to teach them, but also about how the rest of the
class, particularly Malfoy and his cronies, would behave if Umbridge
was watching them.
However, the High Inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they strug-
gled through the snow toward Hagrid, who stood waiting for them on
the edge of the forest. He did not present a reassuring sight; the
bruises that had been purple on Saturday night were now tinged with
green and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding.
Harry could not understand this: Had Hagrid perhaps been attacked
by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from
healing? As though to complete the ominous picture, Hagrid was
carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder.
“We’re workin’ in here today!” Hagrid called happily to the ap-
proaching students, jerking his head back at the dark trees behind
him. “Bit more sheltered! Anyway, they prefer the dark. . . .”
“What prefers the dark?” Harry heard Malfoy say sharply to
Crabbe and Goyle, a trace of panic in his voice. “What did he say
prefers the dark — did you hear?”
Harry remembered the only occasion on which Malfoy had entered
the forest before now; he had not been very brave then either. He
smiled to himself; after the Quidditch match anything that caused
Malfoy discomfort was all right with him.
“Ready?” said Hagrid happily, looking around at the class. “Right,
well, I’ve bin savin’ a trip inter the forest fer yer fifth year. Thought
we’d go an’ see these creatures in their natural habitat. Now, what
we’re studyin’ today is pretty rare, I reckon I’m probably the on’y per-
son in Britain who’s managed ter train ’em —”
“And you’re sure they’re trained, are you?” said Malfoy, the panic in
his voice even more pronounced now. “Only it wouldn’t be the first
time you’d brought wild stuff to class, would it?”
The Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked
as though they thought Malfoy had a fair point too.

443
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
“ ’Course they’re trained,” said Hagrid, scowling and hoisting the
dead cow a little higher on his shoulder.
“So what happened to your face, then?” demanded Malfoy.
“Mind yer own business!” said Hagrid, angrily. “Now if yeh’ve fin-
ished askin’ stupid questions, follow me!”
He turned and strode straight into the forest. Nobody seemed
much disposed to follow. Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who
sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after Hagrid, leading
the rest of the class.
They walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place
where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight
and there was no snow on the ground at all. Hagrid deposited his half
a cow with a grunt on the ground, stepped back, and turned to face
his class again, most of whom were creeping toward him from tree to
tree, peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at
any moment.
“Gather roun’, gather roun’,” said Hagrid encouragingly. “Now,
they’ll be attracted by the smell o’ the meat but I’m goin’ ter give ’em
a call anyway, ’cause they’ll like ter know it’s me. . . .”
He turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face,
and gave an odd, shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like
the call of some monstrous bird. Nobody laughed; most of them
looked too scared to make a sound.
Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again. A minute passed in which the
class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around
trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming. And then,
as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enor-
mous chest, Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space be-
tween two gnarled yew trees.
A pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing larger through
the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face, neck, and then
skeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerged from the dark-

444
THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
ness. It looked around at the class for a few seconds, swishing its long
black tail, then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead
cow with its pointed fangs.
A great wave of relief broke over Harry. Here at last was proof that
he had not imagined these creatures, that they were real: Hagrid knew
about them too. He looked eagerly at Ron, but Ron was still staring
around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, “Why
doesn’t Hagrid call again?”
Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused
and nervously expectant as Ron’s and were still gazing everywhere but
at the horse standing feet from them. There were only two other peo-
ple who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing
just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of
great distaste on his face, and Neville, whose eyes were following the
swishing progress of the long black tail.
“Oh, an’ here comes another one!” said Hagrid proudly, as a second
black horse appeared out of the dark trees, folded its leathery wings
closer to its body, and dipped its head to gorge on the meat. “Now . . .
put yer hands up, who can see ’em?”
Immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the
mystery of these horses, Harry raised his hand. Hagrid nodded at him.
“Yeah . . . yeah, I knew you’d be able ter, Harry,” he said seriously.
“An’ you too, Neville, eh? An’ —”
“Excuse me,” said Malfoy in a sneering voice, “but what exactly are
we supposed to be seeing?”
For answer, Hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground. The
whole class stared at it for a few seconds, then several people gasped
and Parvati squealed. Harry understood why: Bits of flesh stripping
themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to
look very odd indeed.
“What’s doing it?” Parvati demanded in a terrified voice, retreating
behind the nearest tree. “What’s eating it?”

445
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
“Thestrals,” said Hagrid proudly and Hermione gave a soft “oh!” of
comprehension at Harry’s shoulder. “Hogwarts has got a whole herd
of ’em in here. Now, who knows — ?”
“But they’re really, really unlucky!” interrupted Parvati, looking
alarmed. “They’re supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune
on people who see them. Professor Trelawney told me once —”
“No, no, no,” said Hagrid, chuckling, “tha’s jus’ superstition, that
is, they aren’ unlucky, they’re dead clever an’ useful! ’Course, this lot
don’ get a lot o’ work, it’s mainly jus’ pullin’ the school carriages un-
less Dumbledore’s takin’ a long journey an’ don’ want ter Apparate —
an’ here’s another couple, look —”
Two more horses came quietly out of the trees, one of them passing
very close to Parvati, who shivered and pressed herself closer to the
tree, saying, “I think I felt something, I think it’s near me!”
“Don’ worry, it won’ hurt yeh,” said Hagrid patiently. “Righ’, now,
who can tell me why some o’ you can see them an’ some can’t?”
Hermione raised her hand.
“Go on then,” said Hagrid, beaming at her.
“The only people who can see thestrals,” she said, “are people who
have seen death.”
“Tha’s exactly right,” said Hagrid solemnly, “ten points ter Gryffin-
dor. Now, thestrals —”
“Hem, hem.”
Professor Umbridge had arrived. She was standing a few feet away
from Harry, wearing her green hat and cloak again, her clipboard at
the ready. Hagrid, who had never heard Umbridge’s fake cough be-
fore, was gazing in some concern at the closest thestral, evidently un-
der the impression that it had made the sound.
“Hem, hem.”
“Oh hello!” Hagrid said, smiling, having located the source of the
noise.
“You received the note I sent to your cabin this morning?” said

446
THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
Umbridge, in the same loud, slow voice she had used with him earlier,
as though she was addressing somebody both foreign and very slow.
“Telling you that I would be inspecting your lesson?”
“Oh yeah,” said Hagrid brightly. “Glad yeh found the place all
righ’! Well, as you can see — or, I dunno — can you? We’re doin’
thestrals today —”
“I’m sorry?” said Umbridge loudly, cupping her hand around her
ear and frowning. “What did you say?”
Hagrid looked a little confused.
“Er — thestrals!” he said loudly. “Big — er — winged horses, yeh
know!”
He flapped his gigantic arms hopefully. Professor Umbridge raised
her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on her clipboard,
“ ‘has . . . to . . . resort . . . to . . . crude . . . sign . . . language . . .’ ”
“Well . . . anyway . . .” said Hagrid, turning back to the class and
looking slightly flustered. “Erm . . . what was I sayin’?”
“ ‘Appears . . . to . . . have . . . poor . . . short . . . term . . . memory . . .’ ”
muttered Umbridge, loudly enough for everyone to hear her. Draco
Malfoy looked as though Christmas had come a month early; Hermi-
one, on the other hand, had turned scarlet with suppressed rage.
“Oh yeah,” said Hagrid, throwing an uneasy glance at Umbridge’s
clipboard, but plowing on valiantly. “Yeah, I was gonna tell yeh how
come we got a herd. Yeah, so, we started off with a male an’ five fe-
males. This one,” he patted the first horse to have appeared, “name o’
Tenebrus, he’s my special favorite, firs’ one born here in the forest —”
“Are you aware,” Umbridge said loudly, interrupting him, “that the
Ministry of Magic has classified thestrals as ‘dangerous’?”
Harry’s heart sank like a stone, but Hagrid merely chuckled.
“Thestrals aren’ dangerous! All righ, they might take a bite outta
you if yeh really annoy them —”
“ ‘Shows . . . signs . . . of . . . pleasure . . . at . . . idea . . . of . . . vio-
lence . . . ’ ” muttered Umbridge, scribbling on her clipboard again.

447
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
“No — come on!” said Hagrid, looking a little anxious now. “I
mean, a dog’ll bite if yeh bait it, won’ it — but thestrals have jus’ got
a bad reputation because o’ the death thing — people used ter think
they were bad omens, didn’ they? Jus’ didn’ understand, did they?”
Umbridge did not answer; she finished writing her last note, then
looked up at Hagrid and said, again very loudly and slowly, “Please
continue teaching as usual. I am going to walk” — she mimed walk-
ing — Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson were having silent fits of laughter
— “among the students” — she pointed around at individual mem-
bers of the class — “and ask them questions.” She pointed at her
mouth to indicate talking.
Hagrid stared at her, clearly at a complete loss to understand why
she was acting as though he did not understand normal English.
Hermione had tears of fury in her eyes now.
“You hag, you evil hag!” she whispered, as Umbridge walked to-
ward Pansy Parkinson. “I know what you’re doing, you awful, twisted,
vicious —”
“Erm . . . anyway,” said Hagrid, clearly struggling to regain the
flow of his lesson, “so — thestrals. Yeah. Well, there’s loads o’ good
stuff abou’ them. . . .”
“Do you find,” said Professor Umbridge in a ringing voice to Pansy
Parkinson, “that you are able to understand Professor Hagrid when he
talks?”
Just like Hermione, Pansy had tears in her eyes, but these were tears
of laughter; indeed, her answer was almost incoherent because she was
trying to suppress her giggles. “No . . . because . . . well . . . it sounds
. . . like grunting a lot of the time. . . .”
Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard. The few unbruised bits of
Hagrid’s face flushed, but he tried to act as though he had not heard
Pansy’s answer.
“Er . . . yeah . . . good stuff abou’ thestrals. Well, once they’re

448
THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
tamed, like this lot, yeh’ll never be lost again. ‘Mazin’ senses o’ direc-
tion, jus’ tell ’em where yeh want ter go —”
“Assuming they can understand you, of course,” said Malfoy
loudly, and Pansy Parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles. Pro-
fessor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to
Neville.
“You can see the thestrals, Longbottom, can you?” she said.
Neville nodded.
“Whom did you see die?” she asked, her tone indifferent.
“My . . . my grandad,” said Neville.
“And what do you think of them?” she said, waving her stubby
hand at the horses, who by now had stripped a great deal of the car-
cass down to bone.
“Erm,” said Neville nervously, with a glance at Hagrid. “Well,
they’re . . . er . . . okay. . . .”
“ ‘Students . . . are . . . too . . . intimidated . . . to . . . admit . . . they
. . . are . . . frightened. . . .’ ” muttered Umbridge, making another
note on her clipboard.
“No!” said Neville, looking upset, “no, I’m not scared of them — !”
“It’s quite all right,” said Umbridge, patting Neville on the shoul-
der with what she evidently intended to be an understanding smile,
though it looked more like a leer to Harry. “Well, Hagrid,” she turned
to look up at him again, speaking once more in that loud, slow voice,
“I think I’ve got enough to be getting along with. . . . You will re-
ceive” — she mimed taking something from the air in front of her —
“the results of your inspection” — she pointed at the clipboard — “in
ten days’ time.” She held up ten stubby little fingers, then, her smile
wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath her green hat, she
bustled from their midst, leaving Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson in fits
of laughter, Hermione actually shaking with fury, and Neville looking
confused and upset.


CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
“That foul, lying, twisting old gargoyle!” stormed Hermione half
an hour later, as they made their way back up to the castle through the
channels they had made earlier in the snow. “You see what she’s up to?
It’s her thing about half-breeds all over again — she’s trying to make
out Hagrid’s some kind of dim-witted troll, just because he had a gi-
antess for a mother — and oh, it’s not fair, that really wasn’t a bad les-
son at all — I mean, all right, if it had been Blast-Ended Skrewts
again, but thestrals are fine — in fact, for Hagrid, they’re really good!”
“Umbridge said they’re dangerous,” said Ron.
“Well, it’s like Hagrid said, they can look after themselves,” said
Hermione impatiently, “and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank
wouldn’t usually show them to us before N.E.W.T. level, but, well,
they are very interesting, aren’t they? The way some people can see
them and some can’t! I wish I could.”
“Do you?” Harry asked her quietly.
She looked horrorstruck.
“Oh Harry — I’m sorry — no, of course I don’t — that was a re-
ally stupid thing to say —”
“It’s okay,” he said quickly, “don’t worry. . . .”
“I’m surprised so many people could see them,” said Ron. “Three in
a class —”
“Yeah, Weasley, we were just wondering,” said a malicious voice
nearby. Unheard by any of them in the muffling snow, Malfoy,
Crabbe, and Goyle were walking along right behind them. “D’you
reckon if you saw someone snuff it you’d be able to see the Quaffle
better?”
He, Crabbe, and Goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on
their way to the castle and then broke into a chorus of “Weasley Is
Our King.” Ron’s ears turned scarlet.
“Ignore them, just ignore them,” intoned Hermione, pulling out
her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again, so that

450
THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow be-
tween them and the greenhouses.
December arrived, bringing with it more snow and a positive
avalanche of homework for the fifth years. Ron and Hermione’s pre-
fect duties also became more and more onerous as Christmas ap-
proached. They were called upon to supervise the decoration of the
castle (“You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end
and is trying to strangle you with it,” said Ron), to watch over first
and second years spending their break times inside because of the bit-
ter cold (“And they’re cheeky little snotrags, you know, we definitely
weren’t that rude when we were in first year,” said Ron), and to patrol
the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch, who suspected that the holi-
day spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels (“He’s got
dung for brains, that one,” said Ron furiously). They were so busy that
Hermione had stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that she was
down to her last three.
“All those poor elves I haven’t set free yet, having to stay over dur-
ing Christmas because there aren’t enough hats!”
Harry, who had not had the heart to tell her that Dobby was taking
everything she made, bent lower over his History of Magic essay. In
any case, he did not want to think about Christmas. For the first time
in his school career, he very much wanted to spend the holidays away
from Hogwarts. Between his Quidditch ban and worry about whether
or not Hagrid was going to be put on probation, he felt highly resent-
ful toward the place at the moment. The only thing he really looked
forward to were the D.A. meetings, and they would have to stop over
the holidays, as nearly everybody in the D.A. would be spending the
time with their families. Hermione was going skiing with her parents,
something that greatly amused Ron, who had never before heard of
Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood to their feet to slide down

451
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
mountains. Ron, meanwhile, was going home to the Burrow. Harry
endured several days of jealousy before Ron said, in response to Harry
asking how Ron was going to get home for Christmas, “But you’re
coming too! Didn’t I say? Mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks
ago!
Hermione rolled her eyes, but Harry’s spirits soared: The thought
of Christmas at the Burrow was truly wonderful, only slightly marred
by Harry’s guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holi-
day with Sirius. He wondered whether he could possibly persuade
Mrs. Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities too, but apart
from the fact that he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sir-
ius to leave Grimmauld Place, he could not help but feel that Mrs.
Weasley might not want him; they were so often at loggerheads. Sir-
ius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire,
and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on the constant watch
it would be unwise to attempt to contact him, he did not like to think
of Sirius alone in his mother’s old house, perhaps pulling a lonely
cracker with Kreacher.
Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last D.A.
meeting before the holidays and was very glad he had, because when
the lamps burst into light he saw that Dobby had taken it upon him-
self to decorate the place for Christmas. He could tell the elf had done
it, because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles
from the ceiling, each showing a picture of Harry’s face and bearing
the legend HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS!
Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before
the door creaked open and Luna Lovegood entered, looking dreamy
as always.
“Hello,” she said vaguely, looking around at what remained of the
decorations. “These are nice, did you put them up?”
“No,” said Harry, “it was Dobby the house-elf.”

452
THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
“Mistletoe,” said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white
berries placed almost over Harry’s head. He jumped out from under
it. “Good thinking,” said Luna very seriously. “It’s often infested with
nargles.”
Harry was saved the necessity of asking what nargles were by the
arrival of Angelina, Katie, and Alicia. All three of them were breath-
less and looked very cold.
“Well,” said Angelina dully, pulling off her cloak and throwing it
into a corner, “we’ve replaced you.”
“Replaced me?” said Harry blankly.
“You and Fred and George,” she said impatiently. “We’ve got an-
other Seeker!”
“Who?” said Harry quickly.
“Ginny Weasley,” said Katie.
Harry gaped at her.
“Yeah, I know,” said Angelina, pulling out her wand and flexing her
arm. “But she’s pretty good, actually. Nothing on you, of course,” she
said, throwing him a very dirty look, “but as we can’t have you . . .”
Harry bit back the retort he was longing to utter: Did she imagine
for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hun-
dred times more than she did?
“And what about the Beaters?” he asked, trying to keep his voice
even.
“Andrew Kirke,” said Alicia without enthusiasm, “and Jack Sloper.
Neither of them are brilliant, but compared with the rest of the idiots
who turned up . . .”
The arrival of Ron, Hermione, and Neville brought this depressing
discussion to an end and within five minutes, the room was full
enough to prevent him seeing Angelina’s burning, reproachful looks.
“Okay,” he said, calling them all to order. “I thought this evening
we should just go over the things we’ve done so far, because it’s the last

453
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
meeting before the holidays and there’s no point starting anything
new right before a three-week break —”
“We’re not doing anything new?” said Zacharias Smith, in a dis-
gruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room. “If I’d
known that, I wouldn’t have come. . . .”
“We’re all really sorry Harry didn’t tell you, then,” said Fred loudly.
Several people sniggered. Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the fa-
miliar swooping sensation in his stomach, as though he had missed a
step going downstairs.
“We can practice in pairs,” said Harry. “We’ll start with the Im-
pediment Jinx, just for ten minutes, then we can get out the cushions
and try Stunning again.”
They all divided up obediently; Harry partnered Neville as usual.
The room was soon full of intermittent cries of “Impedimenta!” People
froze for a minute or so, during which their partners would stare
aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work, then would
unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx.
Neville had improved beyond all recognition. After a while, when
Harry had unfrozen three times in a row, he had Neville join Ron and
Hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the
others. When he passed Cho she beamed at him; he resisted the temp-
tation to walk past her several more times.
After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, they laid out cushions
all over the floor and started practicing Stunning again. Space was
really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once; half the
group observed the others for a while, then swapped over. Harry felt
himself positively swelling with pride as he watched them all. True,
Neville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean, at whom he had been
aiming, but it was a much closer miss than usual, and everybody else
had made enormous progress.
At the end of an hour, Harry called a halt.

“You’re getting really good,” he said, beaming around at them.
“When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the
big stuff — maybe even Patronuses.”
There was a murmur of excitement. The room began to clear in the
usual twos and threes; most people wished Harry a Happy Christmas
as they went. Feeling cheerful, he collected up the cushions with Ron
and Hermione and stacked them neatly away. Ron and Hermione left
before he did; he hung back a little, because Cho was still there and he
was hoping to receive a Merry Christmas from her.
“No, you go on,” he heard her say to her friend Marietta, and his
heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his Adam’s
apple.
He pretended to be straightening the cushion pile. He was quite
sure they were alone now and waited for her to speak. Instead, he
heard a hearty sniff.
He turned and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears
pouring down her face.
“Wha — ?”
He didn’t know what to do. She was simply standing there, crying
silently.
“What’s up?” he said feebly.
She shook her head and wiped her eyes on her sleeve. “I’m —
sorry,” she said thickly. “I suppose . . . it’s just . . . learning all this
stuff. . . . It just makes me . . . wonder whether . . . if he’d known it all
. . . he’d still be alive. . . .”
Harry’s heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled some-
where around his navel. He ought to have known. She wanted to talk
about Cedric.
“He did know this stuff,” Harry said heavily. “He was really good
at it, or he could never have got to the middle of that maze. But if
Voldemort really wants to kill you, you don’t stand a chance.”


CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
She hiccuped at the sound of Voldemort’s name, but stared at
Harry without flinching.
“You survived when you were just a baby,” she said quietly.
“Yeah, well,” said Harry wearily, moving toward the door, “I dunno
why, nor does anyone else, so it’s nothing to be proud of.”
“Oh don’t go!” said Cho, sounding tearful again. “I’m really sorry
to get all upset like this. . . . I didn’t mean to. . . .”
She hiccuped again. She was very pretty even when her eyes were
red and puffy. Harry felt thoroughly miserable. He’d have been so
pleased just with a Merry Christmas. . . .
“I know it must be horrible for you,” she said, mopping her eyes on
her sleeve again. “Me mentioning Cedric, when you saw him die. . . .
I suppose you just want to forget about it. . . .”
Harry did not say anything to this; it was quite true, but he felt
heartless saying it.
“You’re a r-really good teacher, you know,” said Cho, with a watery
smile. “I’ve never been able to Stun anything before.”
“Thanks,” said Harry awkwardly.
They looked at each other for a long moment. Harry felt a burning
desire to run from the room and, at the same time, a complete inabil-
ity to move his feet.
“Mistletoe,” said Cho quietly, pointing at the ceiling over his head.
“Yeah,” said Harry. His mouth was very dry. “It’s probably full of
nargles, though.”
“What are nargles?”
“No idea,” said Harry. She had moved closer. His brain seemed to
have been Stunned. “You’d have to ask Loony. Luna, I mean.”
Cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh. She
was even nearer him now. He could have counted the freckles on her
nose.
“I really like you, Harry.”

THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
He could not think. A tingling sensation was spreading throughout
him, paralyzing his arms, legs, and brain.
She was much too close. He could see every tear clinging to her
eyelashes. . . .
He returned to the common room half an hour later to find
Hermione and Ron in the best seats by the fire; nearly everybody else
had gone to bed. Hermione was writing a very long letter; she had al-
ready filled half a roll of parchment, which was dangling from the
edge of the table. Ron was lying on the hearthrug, trying to finish his
Transfiguration homework.
“What kept you?” he asked, as Harry sank into the armchair next
to Hermione’s.
Harry did not answer. He was in a state of shock. Half of him
wanted to tell Ron and Hermione what had just happened, but the
other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave.
“Are you all right, Harry?” Hermione asked, peering at him over
the tip of her quill.
Harry gave a halfhearted shrug. In truth, he didn’t know whether
he was all right or not. “What’s up?” said Ron, hoisting himself up on
his elbow to get a clearer view of Harry. “What’s happened?”
Harry didn’t quite know how to set about telling them, and still
wasn’t sure whether he wanted to. Just as he had decided not to say
anything, Hermione took matters out of his hands.
“Is it Cho?” she asked in a businesslike way. “Did she corner you af-
ter the meeting?”
Numbly surprised, Harry nodded. Ron sniggered, breaking off
when Hermione caught his eye.
“So — er — what did she want?” he asked in a mock casual voice.
“She —” Harry began, rather hoarsely; he cleared his throat and
tried again. “She — er —”


“Did you kiss?” asked Hermione briskly.
Ron sat up so fast that he sent his ink bottle flying all over the rug.
Disregarding this completely he stared avidly at Harry.
“Well?” he demanded.
Harry looked from Ron’s expression of mingled curiosity and hilar-
ity to Hermione’s slight frown, and nodded.
“HA!”
Ron made a triumphant gesture with his fist and went into a rau-
cous peal of laughter that made several timid-looking second years
over beside the window jump. A reluctant grin spread over Harry’s
face as he watched Ron rolling around on the hearthrug. Hermione
gave Ron a look of deep disgust and returned to her letter.
“Well?” Ron said finally, looking up at Harry. “How was it?”
Harry considered for a moment.
“Wet,” he said truthfully.
Ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust,
it was hard to tell.
“Because she was crying,” Harry continued heavily.
“Oh,” said Ron, his smile fading slightly. “Are you that bad at
kissing?”
“Dunno,” said Harry, who hadn’t considered this, and immediately
felt rather worried. “Maybe I am.”
“Of course you’re not,” said Hermione absently, still scribbling
away at her letter.
“How do you know?” said Ron in a sharp voice.
“Because Cho spends half her time crying these days,” said Her-
mione vaguely. “She does it at mealtimes, in the loos, all over the
place.”
“You’d think a bit of kissing would cheer her up,” said Ron,
grinning.
“Ron,” said Hermione in a dignified voice, dipping the point of her

458
THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
quill into her ink pot, “you are the most insensitive wart I have ever
had the misfortune to meet.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” said Ron indignantly. “What sort
of person cries while someone’s kissing them?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, slightly desperately, “who does?”
Hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying ex-
pression on her face.
“Don’t you understand how Cho’s feeling at the moment?” she
asked.
“No,” said Harry and Ron together.
Hermione sighed and laid down her quill.
“Well, obviously, she’s feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying.
Then I expect she’s feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now
she likes Harry, and she can’t work out who she likes best. Then she’ll
be feeling guilty, thinking it’s an insult to Cedric’s memory to be kiss-
ing Harry at all, and she’ll be worrying about what everyone else
might say about her if she starts going out with Harry. And she prob-
ably can’t work out what her feelings toward Harry are anyway, be-
cause he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that’s
all very mixed up and painful. Oh, and she’s afraid she’s going to be
thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she’s been flying so
badly.”
A slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech, then Ron
said, “One person can’t feel all that at once, they’d explode.”
“Just because you’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn’t
mean we all have,” said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again.
“She was the one who started it,” said Harry. “I wouldn’t’ve — she
just sort of came at me — and next thing she’s crying all over me — I
didn’t know what to do —”
“Don’t blame you, mate,” said Ron, looking alarmed at the very
thought.


“You just had to be nice to her,” said Hermione, looking up anx-
iously. “You were, weren’t you?”
“Well,” said Harry, an unpleasant heat creeping up his face, “I sort
of — patted her on the back a bit.”
Hermione looked as though she was restraining herself from rolling
her eyes with extreme difficulty.
“Well, I suppose it could have been worse,” she said. “Are you go-
ing to see her again?”
“I’ll have to, won’t I?” said Harry. “We’ve got D.A. meetings,
haven’t we?”
“You know what I mean,” said Hermione impatiently.
Harry said nothing. Hermione’s words opened up a whole new
vista of frightening possibilities. He tried to imagine going somewhere
with Cho — Hogsmeade, perhaps — and being alone with her for
hours at a time. Of course, she would have been expecting him to ask
her out after what had just happened. . . . The thought made his
stomach clench painfully.
“Oh well,” said Hermione distantly, buried in her letter once more,
“you’ll have plenty of opportunities to ask her. . . .”
“What if he doesn’t want to ask her?” said Ron, who had been
watching Harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face.
“Don’t be silly,” said Hermione vaguely, “Harry’s liked her for ages,
haven’t you, Harry?”
He did not answer. Yes, he had liked Cho for ages, but whenever he
had imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured
a Cho who was enjoying herself, as opposed to a Cho who was sob-
bing uncontrollably into his shoulder.
“Who’re you writing the novel to anyway?” Ron asked Hermione,
trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor.
Hermione hitched it up out of sight.
“Viktor.”

460
THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
“Krum?”
“How many other Viktors do we know?”
Ron said nothing, but looked disgruntled. They sat in silence for
another twenty minutes, Ron finishing his Transfiguration essay with
many snorts of impatience and crossings-out, Hermione writing
steadily to the very end of the parchment, rolling it up carefully and
sealing it, and Harry staring into the fire, wishing more than anything
that Sirius’s head would appear there and give him some advice about
girls. But the fire merely crackled lower and lower, until the red-hot
embers crumbled into ash and, looking around, Harry saw that they
were, yet again, the last in the common room.
“Well, ’night,” said Hermione, yawning widely, and she set off up
the girls’ staircase.
“What does she see in Krum?” Ron demanded as he and Harry
climbed the boys’ stairs.
“Well,” said Harry, considering the matter, “I s’pose he’s older, isn’t
he . . . and he’s an international Quidditch player. . . .”
“Yeah, but apart from that,” said Ron, sounding aggravated. “I
mean he’s a grouchy git, isn’t he?”
“Bit grouchy, yeah,” said Harry, whose thoughts were still on Cho.
They pulled off their robes and put on pajamas in silence; Dean,
Seamus, and Neville were already asleep. Harry put his glasses on his
bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed
around his four-poster; instead he stared at the patch of starry sky vis-
ible through the window next to Neville’s bed. If he had known, this
time last night, that in twenty-four hours’ time he would have kissed
Cho Chang . . .
“ ’Night,” grunted Ron, from somewhere to his right.
“ ’Night,” said Harry.
Maybe next time . . . if there was a next time . . . she’d be a bit
happier. He ought to have asked her out; she had probably been


CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
expecting it and was now really angry with him . . . or was she lying in
bed, still crying about Cedric? He did not know what to think.
Hermione’s explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather
than easier to understand.
That’s what they should teach us here, he thought, turning over onto
his side, how girls’ brains work . . . it’d be more useful than Divination
anyway. . . .
Neville snuffled in his sleep. An owl hooted somewhere out in the
night.
Harry dreamed he was back in the D.A. room. Cho was accusing
him of luring her there under false pretenses; she said that he had
promised her a hundred and fifty Chocolate Frog cards if she showed
up. Harry protested. . . . Cho shouted, “Cedric gave me loads of Choco-
late Frog cards, look !” And she pulled out fistfuls of cards from inside
her robes and threw them into the air, and then turned into
Hermione, who said, “You did promise her, you know, Harry. . . . I
think you’d better give her something else instead. . . . How about your
Firebolt?” And Harry was protesting that he could not give Cho his
Firebolt because Umbridge had it, and anyway the whole thing was
ridiculous, he’d only come to the D.A. room to put up some Christ-
mas baubles shaped like Dobby’s head. . . .
The dream changed. . . .
His body felt smooth, powerful, and flexible. He was gliding be-
tween shining metal bars, across dark, cold stone. . . . He was flat
against the floor, sliding along on his belly. . . . It was dark, yet he
could see objects around him shimmering in strange, vibrant colors.
. . . He was turning his head. . . . At first glance, the corridor was
empty . . . but no . . . a man was sitting on the floor ahead, his chin
drooping onto his chest, his outline gleaming in the dark. . . .
Harry put out his tongue. . . . He tasted the man’s scent on the air.
. . . He was alive but drowsing . . . sitting in front of a door at the end
of the corridor . . .

462
THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
Harry longed to bite the man . . . but he must master the impulse.
. . . He had more important work to do. . . .
But the man was stirring . . . a silvery cloak fell from his legs as he
jumped to his feet; and Harry saw his vibrant, blurred outline tower-
ing above him, saw a wand withdrawn from a belt. . . . He had no
choice. . . . He reared high from the floor and struck once, twice,
three times, plunging his fangs deeply into the man’s flesh, feeling his
ribs splinter beneath his jaws, feeling the warm gush of blood. . . .
The man was yelling in pain . . . then he fell silent. . . . He slumped
backward against the wall. . . . Blood was splattering onto the floor. . . .
His forehead hurt terribly. . . . It was aching fit to burst. . . .
“Harry! HARRY!”
He opened his eyes. Every inch of his body was covered in icy
sweat; his bedcovers were twisted all around him like a straitjacket; he
felt as though a white-hot poker was being applied to his forehead.
“Harry!”
Ron was standing over him looking extremely frightened. There
were more figures at the foot of Harry’s bed. He clutched his head in
his hands; the pain was blinding him. . . . He rolled right over and
vomited over the edge of the mattress.
“He’s really ill,” said a scared voice. “Should we call someone?”
“Harry! Harry!”
He had to tell Ron, it was very important that he tell him. . . . Tak-
ing great gulps of air, Harry pushed himself up in bed, willing himself
not to throw up again, the pain half-blinding him.
“Your dad,” he panted, his chest heaving. “Your dad’s . . . been
attacked. . . .”
“What?” said Ron uncomprehendingly.
“Your dad! He’s been bitten, it’s serious, there was blood
everywhere. . . .”
“I’m going for help,” said the same scared voice, and Harry heard
footsteps running out of the dormitory.


CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
“Harry, mate,” said Ron uncertainly, “you . . . you were just
dreaming. . . .”
“No!” said Harry furiously; it was crucial that Ron understand. “It
wasn’t a dream . . . not an ordinary dream. . . . I was there, I saw it.
. . . I did it. . . .”
He could hear Seamus and Dean muttering but did not care. The
pain in his forehead was subsiding slightly, though he was still sweat-
ing and shivering feverishly. He retched again and Ron leapt backward
out of the way.
“Harry, you’re not well,” he said shakily. “Neville’s gone for
help. . . .”
“I’m fine!” Harry choked, wiping his mouth on his pajamas and
shaking uncontrollably. “There’s nothing wrong with me, it’s your dad
you’ve got to worry about — we need to find out where he is — he’s
bleeding like mad — I was — it was a huge snake. . . .”
He tried to get out of bed but Ron pushed him back into it; Dean
and Seamus were still whispering somewhere nearby. Whether one
minute passed or ten, Harry did not know; he simply sat there shak-
ing, feeling the pain recede very slowly from his scar. . . . Then there
were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs, and he heard Neville’s
voice again.
“Over here, Professor . . .”
Professor McGonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in her tar-
tan dressing gown, her glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her
bony nose.
“What is it, Potter? Where does it hurt?”
He had never been so pleased to see her; it was a member of the Or-
der of the Phoenix he needed now, not someone fussing over him and
prescribing useless potions.
“It’s Ron’s dad,” he said, sitting up again. “He’s been attacked by a
snake and it’s serious, I saw it happen.”

464
THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
“What do you mean, you saw it happen?” said Professor McGona-
gall, her dark eyebrows contracting.
“I don’t know. . . . I was asleep and then I was there. . . .”
“You mean you dreamed this?”
“No!” said Harry angrily. Would none of them understand? “I was
having a dream at first about something completely different, some-
thing stupid . . . and then this interrupted it. It was real, I didn’t imag-
ine it, Mr. Weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a
gigantic snake, there was a load of blood, he collapsed, someone’s got
to find out where he is. . . .”
Professor McGonagall was gazing at him through her lopsided
spectacles as though horrified at what she was seeing.
“I’m not lying, and I’m not mad!” Harry told her, his voice rising to
a shout. “I tell you, I saw it happen!”
“I believe you, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall curtly. “Put on
your dressing-gown — we’re going to see the headmaster.”

H
arry was so relieved that she was taking him seriously that he
did not hesitate, but jumped out of bed at once, pulled on
his dressing gown, and pushed his glasses back onto his nose.
“Weasley, you ought to come too,” said Professor McGonagall.
They followed Professor McGonagall past the silent figures of
Neville, Dean, and Seamus, out of the dormitory, down the spiral
stairs into the common room, through the portrait hole, and off along
the Fat Lady’s moonlit corridor. Harry felt as though the panic inside
him might spill over at any moment; he wanted to run, to yell for
Dumbledore. Mr. Weasley was bleeding as they walked along so se-
dately, and what if those fangs (Harry tried hard not to think “my
fangs”) had been poisonous? They passed Mrs. Norris, who turned her
lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly, but Professor McGona-
gall said, “Shoo!” Mrs. Norris slunk away into the shadows, and in a
few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the en-
trance to Dumbledore’s office.
“Fizzing Whizbee,” said Professor McGonagall.

466
ST. MUNGO’S HOSPITAL
FOR MAGICAL MALADIES
AND INJURIES
The gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside; the wall behind it split
in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continuously up-
ward like a spiral escalator. The three of them stepped onto the mov-
ing stairs; the wall closed behind them with a thud, and they were
moving upward in tight circles until they reached the highly polished
oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin.
Though it was now well past midnight, there were voices coming
from inside the room, a positive babble of them. It sounded as though
Dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people.
Professor McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker,
and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them
all off. The door opened of its own accord and Professor McGonagall
led Harry and Ron inside.
The room was in half darkness; the strange silver instruments
standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emit-
ting puffs of smoke as they usually did. The portraits of old headmas-
ters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their
frames. Behind the door, a magnificent red-and-gold bird the size of a
swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing.
“Oh, it’s you, Professor McGonagall . . . and . . . ah.”
Dumbledore was sitting in a high-backed chair behind his desk; he
leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers
laid out before him. He was wearing a magnificently embroidered
purple-and-gold dressing gown over a snowy-white nightshirt, but
seemed wide awake, his penetrating light-blue eyes fixed intently
upon Professor McGonagall.
“Professor Dumbledore, Potter has had a . . . well, a nightmare,”
said Professor McGonagall. “He says . . .”
“It wasn’t a nightmare,” said Harry quickly.
Professor McGonagall looked around at Harry, frowning slightly.
“Very well, then, Potter, you tell the headmaster about it.”
“I . . . well, I was asleep. . . .” said Harry and even in his terror and

467
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
his desperation to make Dumbledore understand he felt slightly irri-
tated that the headmaster was not looking at him, but examining his
own interlocked fingers. “But it wasn’t an ordinary dream . . . it was
real. . . . I saw it happen. . . .” He took a deep breath, “Ron’s dad —
Mr. Weasley — has been attacked by a giant snake.”
The words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them,
slightly ridiculous, even comic. There was a pause in which Dumble-
dore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling. Ron looked
from Harry to Dumbledore, white-faced and shocked.
“How did you see this?” Dumbledore asked quietly, still not look-
ing at Harry.
“Well . . . I don’t know,” said Harry, rather angrily — what did it
matter? “Inside my head, I suppose —”
“You misunderstand me,” said Dumbledore, still in the same calm
tone. “I mean . . . can you remember — er — where you were posi-
tioned as you watched this attack happen? Were you perhaps standing
beside the victim, or else looking down on the scene from above?”
This was such a curious question that Harry gaped at Dumbledore;
it was almost as though he knew . . .
“I was the snake,” he said. “I saw it all from the snake’s point of
view. . . .”
Nobody else spoke for a moment, then Dumbledore, now looking
at Ron, who was still whey-faced, said in a new and sharper voice, “Is
Arthur seriously injured?”
“Yes,” said Harry emphatically — why were they all so slow on the
uptake, did they not realize how much a person bled when fangs that
long pierced their side? And why could Dumbledore not do him the
courtesy of looking at him?
But Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry jumped, and ad-
dressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling.
“Everard?” he said sharply. “And you too, Dilys!”
A sallow-faced wizard with short, black bangs and an elderly witch


with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him, both of whom
seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps, opened their eyes
immediately.
“You were listening?” said Dumbledore.
The wizard nodded, the witch said, “Naturally.”
“The man has red hair and glasses,” said Dumbledore. “Everard,
you will need to raise the alarm, make sure he is found by the right
people —”
Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead
of emerging in neighboring pictures (as usually happened at Hog-
warts), neither reappeared; one frame now contained nothing but a
backdrop of dark curtain, the other a handsome leather armchair.
Harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on
the walls, though snoring and drooling most convincingly, kept
sneaking peeks at him under their eyelids, and he suddenly under-
stood who had been talking when they had knocked.
“Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts’s most celebrated Heads,”
Dumbledore said, now sweeping around Harry, Ron, and Professor
McGonagall and approaching the magnificent sleeping bird on his
perch beside the door. “Their renown is such that both have portraits
hanging in other important Wizarding institutions. As they are free to
move between their own portraits they can tell us what may be hap-
pening elsewhere. . . .”
“But Mr. Weasley could be anywhere!” said Harry.
“Please sit down, all three of you,” said Dumbledore, as though
Harry had not spoken. “Everard and Dilys may not be back for several
minutes. . . . Professor McGonagall, if you could draw up extra
chairs . . .”
Professor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her
dressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air,
straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz
armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured back at Harry’s hearing.

469
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
Harry sat down, watching Dumbledore over his shoulder. Dumble-
dore was now stroking Fawkes’s plumed golden head with one finger.
The phoenix awoke immediately. He stretched his beautiful head high
and observed Dumbledore through bright, dark eyes.
“We will need,” said Dumbledore very quietly to the bird, “a
warning.”
There was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone.
Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver in-
struments whose function Harry had never known, carried it over to
his desk, sat down facing them again, and tapped it gently with the tip
of his wand.
The instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking
noises. Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule sil-
ver tube at the top. Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow
furrowed, and after a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady
stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air. . . . A serpent’s
head grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide. Harry won-
dered whether the instrument was confirming his story: He looked
eagerly at Dumbledore for a sign that he was right, but Dumbledore
did not look up.
“Naturally, naturally,” murmured Dumbledore apparently to him-
self, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of
surprise. “But in essence divided?”
Harry could make neither head nor tail of this question. The
smoke serpent, however, split itself instantly into two snakes, both
coiling and undulating in the dark air. With a look of grim satisfaction
Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand:
The clinking noise slowed and died, and the smoke serpents grew
faint, became a formless haze, and vanished.
Dumbledore replaced the instrument upon its spindly little table;
Harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him
with their eyes, then, realizing that Harry was watching them, hastily

pretend to be sleeping again. Harry wanted to ask what the strange sil-
ver instrument was for, but before he could do so, there was a shout
from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had
reappeared in his portrait, panting slightly.
“Dumbledore!”
“What news?” said Dumbledore at once.
“I yelled until someone came running,” said the wizard, who was
mopping his brow on the curtain behind him, “said I’d heard some-
thing moving downstairs — they weren’t sure whether to believe me
but went down to check — you know there are no portraits down
there to watch from. Anyway, they carried him up a few minutes later.
He doesn’t look good, he’s covered in blood, I ran along to Elfrida
Cragg’s portrait to get a good view as they left —”
“Good,” said Dumbledore as Ron made a convulsive movement, “I
take it Dilys will have seen him arrive, then —”
And moments later, the silver-ringletted witch had reappeared in
her picture too; she sank, coughing, into her armchair and said, “Yes,
they’ve taken him to St. Mungo’s, Dumbledore. . . . They carried him
past under my portrait. . . . He looks bad. . . .”
“Thank you,” said Dumbledore. He looked around at Professor
McGonagall.
“Minerva, I need you to go and wake the other Weasley children.”
“Of course. . . .”
Professor McGonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door; Harry
cast a sideways glance at Ron, who was now looking terrified.
“And Dumbledore — what about Molly?” said Professor McGona-
gall, pausing at the door.
“That will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a
lookout for anybody approaching,” said Dumbledore. “But she may
already know . . . that excellent clock of hers . . .”
Harry knew Dumbledore was referring to the clock that told, not
the time, but the whereabouts and conditions of the various Weasley


CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
family members, and with a pang he thought that Mr. Weasley’s hand
must, even now, be pointing at “mortal peril.” But it was very late. . . .
Mrs. Weasley was probably asleep, not watching the clock. . . . And
he felt cold as he remembered Mrs. Weasley’s boggart turning into
Mr. Weasley’s lifeless body, his glasses askew, blood running down his
face. . . . But Mr. Weasley wasn’t going to die. . . . He couldn’t. . . .
Dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind Harry and
Ron. He emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle, which he
placed carefully upon his desk. He raised his wand and murmured
“Portus”; for a moment the kettle trembled, glowing with an odd blue
light, then it quivered to a rest, as solidly black as ever.
Dumbledore marched over to another portrait, this time of a
clever-looking wizard with a pointed beard, who had been painted
wearing the Slytherin colors of green and silver and was apparently
sleeping so deeply that he could not hear Dumbledore’s voice when he
attempted to rouse him.
“Phineas. Phineas.”
And now the subjects of the portraits lining the room were no
longer pretending to be asleep; they were shifting around in their
frames, the better to watch what was happening. When the clever-
looking wizard continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his
name too.
“Phineas! Phineas! PHINEAS!”
He could not pretend any longer; he gave a theatrical jerk and
opened his eyes wide.
“Did someone call?”
“I need you to visit your other portrait again, Phineas,” said Dum-
bledore. “I’ve got another message.”
“Visit my other portrait?” said Phineas in a reedy voice, giving a
long, fake yawn (his eyes traveling around the room and focusing
upon Harry). “Oh no, Dumbledore, I am too tired tonight. . . .”
Something about Phineas’s voice was familiar to Harry. Where had

472

AND INJURIES
he heard it before? But before he could think, the portraits on the sur-
rounding walls broke into a storm of protest.
“Insubordination, sir!” roared a corpulent, red-nosed wizard, bran-
dishing his fists. “Dereliction of duty!”
“We are honor-bound to give service to the present Headmaster of
Hogwarts!” cried a frail-looking old wizard whom Harry recognized as
Dumbledore’s predecessor, Armando Dippet. “Shame on you, Phineas!”
“Shall I persuade him, Dumbledore?” called a gimlet-eyed witch,
raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod.
“Oh, very well,” said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing this wand
slightly apprehensively, “though he may well have destroyed my pic-
ture by now, he’s done most of the family —”
“Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,” said Dumbledore, and
Harry realized immediately where he had heard Phineas’s voice before:
issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grim-
mauld Place. “You are to give him the message that Arthur Weasley
has been gravely injured and that his wife, children, and Harry Potter
will be arriving at his house shortly. Do you understand?”
“Arthur Weasley, injured, wife and children and Harry Potter
coming to stay,” recited Phineas in a bored voice. “Yes, yes . . . very
well. . . .”
He sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from
view at the very moment that the study door opened again. Fred,
George, and Ginny were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall, all
three of them looking disheveled and shocked, still in their night
things.
“Harry — what’s going on?” asked Ginny, who looked frightened.
“Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad hurt —”
“Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Or-
der of the Phoenix,” said Dumbledore before Harry could speak. “He
has been taken to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and In-
juries. I am sending you back to Sirius’s house, which is much more

473
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
convenient for the hospital than the Burrow. You will meet your
mother there.”
“How’re we going?” asked Fred, looking shaken. “Floo powder?”
“No,” said Dumbledore, “Floo powder is not safe at the moment,
the Network is being watched. You will be taking a Portkey.” He indi-
cated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk. “We are just waiting
for Phineas Nigellus to report back. . . . I wish to be sure that the coast
is clear before sending you —”
There was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office, leaving
behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor.
“It is Fawkes’s warning,” said Dumbledore, catching the feather as
it fell. “She must know you’re out of your beds. . . . Minerva, go and
head her off — tell her any story —”
Professor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan.
“He says he’ll be delighted,” said a bored voice behind Dumble-
dore; the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his
Slytherin banner. “My great-great-grandson has always had odd taste
in houseguests. . . .”
“Come here, then,” Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys.
“And quickly, before anyone else joins us . . .”
Harry and the others gathered around Dumbledore’s desk.
“You have all used a Portkey before?” asked Dumbledore, and they
nodded, each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle.
“Good. On the count of three then . . . one . . . two . . .”
It happened in a fraction of a second: In the infinitesimal pause be-
fore Dumbledore said “three,” Harry looked up at him — they were
very close together — and Dumbledore’s clear blue gaze moved from
the Portkey to Harry’s face.
At once, Harry’s scar burned white-hot, as though the old wound
had burst open again — and unbidden, unwanted, but terrifyingly
strong, there rose within Harry a hatred so powerful he felt, for that


AND INJURIES
instant, that he would like nothing better than to strike — to bite —
to sink his fangs into the man before him —
“. . . three.”
He felt a powerful jerk behind his navel, the ground vanished from
beneath his feet, his hand was glued to the kettle; he was banging into
the others as all sped forward in a swirl of colors and a rush of wind,
the kettle pulling them onward and then —
His feet hit the ground so hard that his knees buckled, the kettle
clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said,
“Back again, the blood traitor brats, is it true their father’s dying . . . ?”
“OUT!” roared a second voice.
Harry scrambled to his feet and looked around; they had arrived in
the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
The only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle,
which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper. Kreacher was dis-
appearing through the door to the hall, looking back at them malevo-
lently as he hitched up his loincloth; Sirius was hurrying toward them
all, looking anxious. He was unshaven and still in his day clothes;
there was also a slightly Mundungus-like whiff of stale drink about
him.
“What’s going on?” he said, stretching out a hand to help Ginny
up. “Phineas Nigellus said Arthur’s been badly injured —”
“Ask Harry,” said Fred.
“Yeah, I want to hear this for myself,” said George.
The twins and Ginny were staring at him. Kreacher’s footsteps had
stopped on the stairs outside.
“It was —” Harry began; this was even worse than telling McGona-
gall and Dumbledore. “I had a — a kind of — vision. . . .”
And he told them all that he had seen, though he altered the story
so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the
snake attacked, rather than from behind the snake’s own eyes. . . .

475
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
Ron, who was still very white, gave him a fleeting look, but did not
speak. When Harry had finished, Fred, George, and Ginny continued
to stare at him for a moment. Harry did not know whether he was
imagining it or not, but he fancied there was something accusatory in
their looks. Well, if they were going to blame him for just seeing the
attack, he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the
snake at the time. . . .
“Is Mum here?” said Fred, turning to Sirius.
“She probably doesn’t even know what’s happened yet,” said Sirius.
“The important thing was to get you away before Umbridge could in-
terfere. I expect Dumbledore’s letting Molly know now.”
“We’ve got to go to St. Mungo’s,” said Ginny urgently. She looked
around at her brothers; they were of course still in their pajamas. “Sir-
ius, can you lend us cloaks or anything — ?”
“Hang on, you can’t go tearing off to St. Mungo’s!” said Sirius.
“ ’Course we can go to St. Mungo’s if we want,” said Fred, with a
mulish expression, “he’s our dad!”
“And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was at-
tacked before the hospital even let his wife know?”
“What does that matter?” said George hotly.
“It matters because we don’t want to draw attention to the fact that
Harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles
away!” said Sirius angrily. “Have you any idea what the Ministry
would make of that information?”
Fred and George looked as though they could not care less what the
Ministry made of anything. Ron was still white-faced and silent.
Ginny said, “Somebody else could have told us. . . . We could have
heard it somewhere other than Harry. . . .”
“Like who?” said Sirius impatiently. “Listen, your dad’s been hurt
while on duty for the Order and the circumstances are fishy enough
without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened, you
could seriously damage the Order’s —”

476
ST. MUNGO’S HOSPITAL
FOR MAGICAL MALADIES
AND INJURIES
“We don’t care about the dumb Order!” shouted Fred.
“It’s our dad dying we’re talking about!” yelled George.
“Your father knew what he was getting into, and he won’t thank
you for messing things up for the Order!” said Sirius angrily in his
turn. “This is how it is — this is why you’re not in the Order — you
don’t understand — there are things worth dying for!”
“Easy for you to say, stuck here!” bellowed Fred. “I don’t see you
risking your neck!”
The little color remaining in Sirius’s face drained from it. He
looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit Fred, but
when he spoke, it was in a voice of determined calm. “I know it’s hard,
but we’ve all got to act as though we don’t know anything yet. We’ve
got to stay put, at least until we hear from your mother, all right?”
Fred and George still looked mutinous. Ginny, however, took a few
steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it. Harry looked at Ron,
who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and shrug,
and they sat down too. The twins glared at Sirius for another minute,
then took seats on either side of Ginny.
“That’s right,” said Sirius encouragingly, “come on, let’s all . . . let’s
all have a drink while we’re waiting. Accio Butterbeer!”
He raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying
toward them out of the pantry, skidded along the table, scattering the
debris of Sirius’s meal, and stopped neatly in front of the six of them.
They all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the crack-
ling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table.
Harry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands.
His stomach was full of horrible hot, bubbling guilt. They would not
be here if it were not for him; they would all still be asleep in bed. And
it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured
that Mr. Weasley was found, because there was also the inescapable
business of it being he who had attacked Mr. Weasley in the first
place. . . .

477
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
Don’t be stupid, you haven’t got fangs, he told himself, trying to keep
calm, though the hand on his butterbeer bottle was shaking. You were
lying in bed, you weren’t attacking anyone. . . .
But then, what just happened in Dumbledore’s office? he asked him-
self. I felt like I wanted to attack Dumbledore too. . . .
He put the bottle down on the table a little harder than he meant
to, so that it slopped over onto the table. No one took any notice.
Then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of
them and as they gave cries of shock, a scroll of parchment fell with a
thud onto the table, accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail
feather.
“Fawkes!” said Sirius at once, snatching up the parchment. “That’s
not Dumbledore’s writing — it must be a message from your
mother — here —”
He thrust the letter into George’s hand, who ripped it open and
read aloud, “Dad is still alive. I am setting out for St. Mungo’s now. Stay
where you are. I will send news as soon as I can. Mum.”
George looked around the table.
“Still alive . . .” he said slowly. “But that makes it sound . . .”
He did not need to finish the sentence. It sounded to Harry too as
though Mr. Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death.
Still exceptionally pale, Ron stared at the back of his mother’s letter as
though it might speak words of comfort to him. Fred pulled the
parchment out of George’s hands and read it for himself, then looked
up at Harry, who felt his hand shaking on his butterbeer bottle again
and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling.
If Harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one he could
not remember it. Sirius suggested once that they all go to bed, but
without any real conviction, and the Weasleys’ looks of disgust were
answer enough. They mostly sat in silence around the table, watching
the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax, now and
then raising bottles to their lips, speaking only to check the time, to

478

FOR MAGICAL MALADIES
AND INJURIES
wonder aloud what was happening, and to reassure one another that
if there was bad news, they would know straightaway, for Mrs.
Weasley must long since have arrived at St. Mungo’s.
Fred fell into a doze, his head sagging sideways onto his shoulder.
Ginny was curled like a cat on her chair, but her eyes were open;
Harry could see them reflecting the firelight. Ron was sitting with his
head in his hands, whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell.
And he and Sirius looked at each other every so often, intruders upon
the family grief, waiting . . . waiting . . .
And then, at ten past five in the morning by Ron’s watch, the
kitchen door swung open and Mrs. Weasley entered the kitchen. She
was extremely pale, but when they all turned to look at her, Fred, Ron,
and Harry half-rising from their chairs, she gave a wan smile.
“He’s going to be all right,” she said, her voice weak with tiredness.
“He’s sleeping. We can all go and see him later. Bill’s sitting with him
now, he’s going to take the morning off work.”
Fred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face. George
and Ginny got up, walked swiftly over to their mother, and hugged
her. Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his butterbeer
in one.
“Breakfast!” said Sirius loudly and joyfully, jumping to his feet.
“Where’s that accursed house-elf? Kreacher! KREACHER!”
But Kreacher did not answer the summons.
“Oh, forget it, then,” muttered Sirius, counting the people in front
of him. “So it’s breakfast for — let’s see — seven . . . Bacon and eggs,
I think, and some tea, and toast —”
Harry hurried over to the stove to help. He did not want to intrude
upon the Weasleys’ happiness, and he dreaded the moment when
Mrs. Weasley would ask him to recount his vision. However, he had
barely taken plates from the dresser when Mrs. Weasley lifted them
out of his hands and pulled him into a hug.
“I don’t know what would have happened if it hadn’t been for you,

479
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
Harry,” she said in a muffled voice. “They might not have found
Arthur for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to
you he’s alive and Dumbledore’s been able to think up a good cover
story for Arthur being where he was, you’ve no idea what trouble he
would have been in otherwise, look at poor Sturgis. . . .”
Harry could hardly stand her gratitude, but fortunately she soon
released him to turn to Sirius and thank him for looking after her chil-
dren through the night. Sirius said that he was very pleased to have
been able to help, and hoped they would all stay with him as long as
Mr. Weasley was in hospital.
“Oh, Sirius, I’m so grateful. . . . They think he’ll be there a little
while and it would be wonderful to be nearer . . . Of course, that
might mean we’re here for Christmas. . . .”
“The more the merrier!” said Sirius with such obvious sincerity that
Mrs. Weasley beamed at him, threw on an apron, and began to help
with breakfast.
“Sirius,” Harry muttered, unable to stand it a moment longer.
“Can I have a quick word? Er — now?”
He walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed. Without pre-
amble Harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had,
including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had at-
tacked Mr. Weasley.
When he paused for breath, Sirius said, “Did you tell Dumbledore
this?”
“Yes,” said Harry impatiently, “but he didn’t tell me what it meant.
Well, he doesn’t tell me anything anymore. . . .”
“I’m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry
about,” said Sirius steadily.
“But that’s not all,” said Harry in a voice only a little above a whis-
per. “Sirius, I . . . I think I’m going mad. . . . Back in Dumbledore’s
office, just before we took the Portkey . . . for a couple of seconds


AND INJURIES
there I thought I was a snake, I felt like one — my scar really hurt
when I was looking at Dumbledore — Sirius, I wanted to attack
him —”
He could only see a sliver of Sirius’s face; the rest was in darkness.
“It must have been the aftermath of the vision, that’s all,” said Sir-
ius. “You were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and —”
“It wasn’t that,” said Harry, shaking his head. “It was like some-
thing rose up inside me, like there’s a snake inside me —”
“You need to sleep,” said Sirius firmly. “You’re going to have break-
fast and then go upstairs to bed, and then you can go and see Arthur
after lunch with the others. You’re in shock, Harry; you’re blaming
yourself for something you only witnessed, and it’s lucky you did wit-
ness it or Arthur might have died. Just stop worrying. . . .”
He clapped Harry on the shoulder and left the pantry, leaving
Harry standing alone in the dark.
Everyone but Harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping. He went
up to the bedroom he had shared with Ron over the summer, but while
Ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, Harry sat fully
clothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead, keeping
himself deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze,
terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and awake
to find that he had attacked Ron, or else slithered through the house
after one of the others. . . .
When Ron woke up, Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing
nap too. Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating
lunch, so that they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St. Mungo’s.
Everybody except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they
changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts, and they greeted
Tonks and Mad-Eye, who had turned up to escort them across Lon-
don, gleefully laughing at the bowler hat Mad-Eye was wearing at an

481
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him, truthfully, that
Tonks, whose hair was short and bright pink again, would attract far
less attention on the underground.
Tonks was very interested in Harry’s vision of the attack on Mr.
Weasley, something he was not remotely interested in discussing.
“There isn’t any Seer blood in your family, is there?” she inquired
curiously, as they sat side by side on a train rattling toward the heart
of the city.
“No,” said Harry, thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling
insulted.
“No,” said Tonks musingly, “no, I suppose it’s not really prophecy
you’re doing, is it? I mean, you’re not seeing the future, you’re seeing
the present. . . . It’s odd, isn’t it? Useful, though . . .”
Harry did not answer; fortunately they got out at the next stop, a
station in the very heart of London, and in the bustle of leaving the
train he was able to allow Fred and George to get between himself and
Tonks, who was leading the way. They all followed her up the escala-
tor, Moody clunking along at the back of the group, his bowler tilted
low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat,
clutching his wand. Harry thought he sensed the concealed eye star-
ing hard at him; trying to deflect more questions about his dream he
asked Mad-Eye where St. Mungo’s was hidden.
“Not far from here,” grunted Moody as they stepped out into the
wintry air on a broad store-lined street packed with Christmas shop-
pers. He pushed Harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just
behind; Harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the
tilted hat. “Wasn’t easy to find a good location for a hospital. Nowhere
in Diagon Alley was big enough and we couldn’t have it underground
like the Ministry — unhealthy. In the end they managed to get hold of
a building up here. Theory was sick wizards could come and go and
just blend in with the crowd. . . .”

482
ST. MUNGO’S HOSPITAL
FOR MAGICAL MALADIES
AND INJURIES
He seized Harry’s shoulder to prevent them being separated by a
gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a
nearby shop full of electrical gadgets.
“Here we go,” said Moody a moment later.
They had arrived outside a large, old-fashioned, red brick depart-
ment store called Purge and Dowse Ltd. The place had a shabby, mis-
erable air; the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies
with their wigs askew, standing at random and modeling fashions at
least ten years out of date. Large signs on all the dusty doors read
closed for refurbishment. Harry distinctly heard a large woman
laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed, “It’s
never open, that place. . . .”
“Right,” said Tonks, beckoning them forward to a window display-
ing nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy whose false eye-
lashes were hanging off and who was modeling a green nylon pinafore
dress. “Everybody ready?”
They nodded, clustering around her; Moody gave Harry another
shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and Tonks
leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy and said,
her breath steaming up the glass, “Wotcher . . . We’re here to see
Arthur Weasley.”
For a split second, Harry thought how absurd it was for Tonks to ex-
pect the dummy to hear her talking that quietly through a sheet of
glass, when there were buses rumbling along behind her and all the
racket of a street full of shoppers. Then he reminded himself that dum-
mies could not hear anyway. Next second his mouth opened in shock
as the dummy gave a tiny nod, beckoned its jointed finger, and Tonks
had seized Ginny and Mrs. Weasley by the elbows, stepped right
through the glass and vanished.
Fred, George, and Ron stepped after them; Harry glanced around
at the jostling crowd; not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare

483
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
for window displays as ugly as Purge and Dowse Ltd.’s, nor did any of
them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin
air in front of them.
“C’mon,” growled Moody, giving Harry yet another poke in the
back and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet
of cool water, emerging quite warm and dry on the other side.
There was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had
stood. They had arrived in what seemed to be a crowded reception
area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden
chairs, some looking perfectly normal and perusing out-of-date copies
of Witch Weekly, others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as ele-
phant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests. The room was
scarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients were
making very peculiar noises. A sweaty-faced witch in the center of the
front row, who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the Daily
Prophet, kept letting off a high-pitched whistle as steam came pouring
out of her mouth, and a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged
like a bell every time he moved, and with each clang his head vibrated
horribly, so that he had to seize himself by the ears and hold it steady.
Witches and wizards in lime-green robes were walking up and
down the rows, asking questions and making notes on clipboards like
Umbridge’s. Harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests:
a wand and bone, crossed.
“Are they doctors?” he asked Ron quietly.
“Doctors?” said Ron, looking startled. “Those Muggle nutters that
cut people up? Nah, they’re Healers.”
“Over here!” called Mrs. Weasley over the renewed clanging of the
warlock in the corner, and they followed her to the queue in front of a
plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked inquiries. The wall be-
hind her was covered in notices and posters saying things like a clean
cauldron keeps potions from becoming poisons and antidotes
are anti-don’ts unless approved by a qualified healer.


There was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets
that was labelled
DILYS DERWENT

headmistress of hogwarts school of
witchcraft and wizardry, i74i–i768
Dilys was eyeing the Weasley party as though counting them; when
Harry caught her eye she gave a tiny wink, walked sideways out of her
portrait, and vanished.
Meanwhile, at the front of the queue, a young wizard was perform-
ing an odd on-the-spot jig and trying, in between yelps of pain, to
explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk.
“It’s these — ouch — shoes my brother gave me — ow — they’re
eating my — OUCH — feet — look at them, there must be some
kind of — AARGH — jinx on them and I can’t — AAAAARGH —
get them off —”
He hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot
coals.
“The shoes don’t prevent you reading, do they?” said the blonde
witch irritably, pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk. “You
want Spell Damage, fourth floor. Just like it says on the floor guide.
Next!”
The wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way, the
Weasley party moved forward a few steps and Harry read the floor

If you are unsure where to go, incapable, of normal speech, or

A very old, stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to
the front of the queue now.
“I’m here to see Broderick Bode!” he wheezed.
“Ward forty-nine, but I’m afraid you’re wasting your time,” said the
witch dismissively “He’s completely addled, you know, still thinks he’s
a teapot. . . . Next!”
A harassed-looking wizard was holding his small daughter tightly
by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely
large, feathery wings that had sprouted right out the back of her
romper suit.
“Fourth floor,” said the witch in a bored voice, without asking, and
the man disappeared through the double doors beside the desk, hold-
ing his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon. “Next!”
Mrs. Weasley moved forward to the desk.
“Hello,” she said. “My husband, Arthur Weasley, was supposed to
be moved to a different ward this morning, could you tell us — ?”
“Arthur Weasley?” said the witch, running her finger down a long

list in front of her. “Yes, first floor, second door on the right, Dai
Llewellyn ward.”
“Thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Come on, you lot.”
They followed through the double doors and along the narrow cor-
ridor beyond, which was lined with more portraits of famous Healers
and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling,
looking like giant soapsuds. More witches and wizards in lime-green
robes walked in and out of the doors they passed; a foul-smelling yel-
low gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door, and every
now and then they heard distant wailing. They climbed a flight of
stairs and entered the “Creature-Induced Injuries” corridor, where the
second door on the right bore the words “dangerous” dai llewellyn
ward: serious bites. Underneath this was a card in a brass holder on
which had been handwritten Healer-in-Charge: Hippocrates Smeth-
wyck, Trainee Healer: Augustus Pye.
“We’ll wait outside, Molly,” Tonks said. “Arthur won’t want too
many visitors at once. . . . It ought to be just the family first.”
Mad-Eye growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his
back against the corridor wall, his magical eye spinning in all direc-
tions. Harry drew back too, but Mrs. Weasley reached out a hand and
pushed him through the door, saying, “Don’t be silly, Harry, Arthur
wants to thank you. . . .”
The ward was small and rather dingy as the only window was narrow
and set high in the wall facing the door. Most of the light came from
more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling. The
walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather vicious-
looking wizard on the wall, captioned urquhart rackharrow, 1612–
1697, inventor of the entrail-expelling curse.
There were only three patients. Mr. Weasley was occupying the bed
at the far end of the ward beside the tiny window. Harry was pleased and
relieved to see that he was propped up on several pillows and reading the


CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
Daily Prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling onto his bed. He
looked around as they walked toward him and, seeing whom it was,
beamed.
“Hello!” he called, throwing the Prophet aside. “Bill just left, Molly,
had to get back to work, but he says he’ll drop in on you later. . . .”
“How are you, Arthur?” asked Mrs. Weasley, bending down to kiss
his cheek and looking anxiously into his face. “You’re still looking a bit
peaky. . . .”
“I feel absolutely fine,” said Mr. Weasley brightly, holding out his
good arm to give Ginny a hug. “If they could only take the bandages
off, I’d be fit to go home.”
“Why can’t they take them off, Dad?” asked Fred.
“Well, I start bleeding like mad every time they try,” said Mr.
Weasley cheerfully, reaching across for his wand, which lay on his bed-
side cabinet, and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bed-
side to seat them all. “It seems there was some rather unusual kind of
poison in that snake’s fangs that keeps wounds open. . . . They’re sure
they’ll find an antidote, though, they say they’ve had much worse
cases than mine, and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a
Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour. But that fellow over there,” he
said, dropping his voice and nodding toward the bed opposite in
which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling.
“Bitten by a werewolf, poor chap. No cure at all.”
“A werewolf?” whispered Mrs. Weasley, looking alarmed. “Is he
safe in a public ward? Shouldn’t he be in a private room?”
“It’s two weeks till full moon,” Mr. Weasley reminded her quietly.
“They’ve been talking to him this morning, the Healers, you know,
trying to persuade him he’ll be able to lead an almost normal life. I
said to him — didn’t mention names, of course — but I said I knew a
werewolf personally, very nice man, who finds the condition quite
easy to manage. . . .”
“What did he say?” asked George.


AND INJURIES
“Said he’d give me another bite if I didn’t shut up,” said Mr. Weasley
sadly. “And that woman over there,” he indicated the only other occu-
pied bed, which was right beside the door, “won’t tell the Healers what
bit her, which makes us all think it must have been something she was
handling illegally. Whatever it was took a real chunk out of her leg,
very nasty smell when they take off the dressings.”
“So, you going to tell us what happened, Dad?” asked Fred, pulling
his chair closer to the bed.
“Well, you already know, don’t you?” said Mr. Weasley, with a sig-
nificant smile at Harry. “It’s very simple — I’d had a very long day,
dozed off, got sneaked up on, and bitten.”
“Is it in the Prophet, you being attacked?” asked Fred, indicating the
newspaper Mr. Weasley had cast aside.
“No, of course not,” said Mr. Weasley, with a slightly bitter smile,
“the Ministry wouldn’t want everyone to know a dirty great serpent
got —”
“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley warningly.
“— got — er — me,” Mr. Weasley said hastily, though Harry was
quite sure that was not what he had meant to say.
“So where were you when it happened, Dad?” asked George.
“That’s my business,” said Mr. Weasley, though with a small smile.
He snatched up the Daily Prophet, shook it open again and said, “I
was just reading about Willy Widdershins’s arrest when you arrived.
You know Willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets
last summer? One of his jinxes backfired, the toilet exploded, and they
found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to
foot in —”
“When you say you were ‘on duty,’ ” Fred interrupted in a low
voice, “what were you doing?”
“You heard your father,” whispered Mrs. Weasley, “we are not dis-
cussing this here! Go on about Willy Widdershins, Arthur —”
“Well, don’t ask me how, but he actually got off on the toilet


charge,” said Mr. Weasley grimly. “I can only suppose gold changed
hands —”
“You were guarding it, weren’t you?” said George quietly. “The
weapon? The thing You-Know-Who’s after?”
“George, be quiet!” snapped Mrs. Weasley.
“Anyway,” said Mr. Weasley in a raised voice, “this time Willy’s
been caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles, and I don’t think
he’ll be able to worm his way out of it because according to this arti-
cle, two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St. Mungo’s for
emergency bone regrowth and memory modification. Just think of it,
Muggles in St. Mungo’s! I wonder which ward they’re in?”
And he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost.
“Didn’t you say You-Know-Who’s got a snake, Harry?” asked Fred,
looking at his father for a reaction. “A massive one? You saw it the
night he returned, didn’t you?”
“That’s enough,” said Mrs. Weasley crossly. “Mad-Eye and Tonks
are outside, Arthur, they want to come and see you. And you lot can
wait outside,” she added to her children and Harry. “You can come
and say good-bye afterward. Go on. . . .”
They trooped back into the corridor. Mad-Eye and Tonks went in
and closed the door of the ward behind them. Fred raised his eyebrows.
“Fine,” he said coolly, rummaging in his pockets, “be like that.
Don’t tell us anything.”
“Looking for these?” said George, holding out what looked like a
tangle of flesh-colored string.
“You read my mind,” said Fred, grinning. “Let’s see if St. Mungo’s
puts Imperturbable Charms on its ward doors, shall we?”
He and George disentangled the string and separated five Extend-
able Ears from each other. Fred and George handed them around.
Harry hesitated to take one.
“Go on, Harry, take it! You saved Dad’s life, if anyone’s got the right
to eavesdrop on him it’s you. . . .”


ST. MUNGO’S HOSPITAL
FOR MAGICAL MALADIES
AND INJURIES
Grinning in spite of himself, Harry took the end of the string and
inserted it into his ear as the twins had done.
“Okay, go!” Fred whispered.
The flesh-colored strings wriggled like long skinny worms, then
snaked under the door. For a few seconds Harry could hear nothing,
then he heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though she were stand-
ing right beside him.
“. . . they searched the whole area but they couldn’t find the snake
anywhere, it just seems to have vanished after it attacked you, Arthur.
. . . But You-Know-Who can’t have expected a snake to get in, can
he?”
“I reckon he sent it as a lookout,” growled Moody, “ ’cause he’s not
had any luck so far, has he? No, I reckon he’s trying to get a clearer pic-
ture of what he’s facing and if Arthur hadn’t been there the beast
would’ve had much more time to look around. So Potter says he saw
it all happen?”
“Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded rather uneasy. “You know,
Dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for Harry to see
something like this. . . .”
“Yeah, well,” said Moody, “there’s something funny about the
Potter kid, we all know that.”
“Dumbledore seemed worried about Harry when I spoke to him
this morning,” whispered Mrs. Weasley.
“ ’Course he’s worried,” growled Moody. “The boy’s seeing things
from inside You-Know-Who’s snake. . . . Obviously, Potter doesn’t re-
alize what that means, but if You-Know-Who’s possessing him —”
Harry pulled the Extendable Ear out of his own, his heart ham-
mering very fast and heat rushing up his face. He looked around at the
others. They were all staring at him, the strings still trailing from their
ears, looking suddenly fearful.

as this why Dumbledore would no longer meet Harry’s
eyes? Did he expect to see Voldemort staring out of them,
afraid, perhaps, that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet,
with catlike slits for pupils? Harry remembered how the snakelike face
of Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quir-
rell’s head, and he ran his hand over the back of his own, wondering
what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull. . . .
He felt dirty, contaminated, as though he were carrying some
deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the underground train back from the
hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were
free of the taint of Voldemort. . . . He had not merely seen the snake,
he had been the snake, he knew it now. . . .
And then a truly terrible thought occurred to him, a memory bob-
bing to the surface of his mind, one that made his insides writhe and
squirm like serpents. . . .
“What’s he after apart from followers?”
“Stuff he can only get by stealth . . . like a weapon. Something he didn’t
have last time.”

492
CHRISTMAS ON THE
CLOSED WARD
I’m the weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were
pumping through his veins, chilling him, bringing him out in a sweat
as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel. I’m the one Volde-
mort’s trying to use, that’s why they’ve got guards around me everywhere I
go, it’s not for my protection, it’s for other people’s, only it’s not working,
they can’t have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts. . . . I did attack
Mr. Weasley last night, it was me, Voldemort made me do it and he could
be inside me, listening to my thoughts right now. . . .
“Are you all right, Harry, dear?” whispered Mrs. Weasley, leaning
across Ginny to speak to him as the train rattled along through its
dark tunnel. “You don’t look very well. Are you feeling sick?”
They were all watching him. He shook his head violently and
stared up at an advertisement for home insurance.
“Harry, dear, are you sure you’re all right?” said Mrs. Weasley in a
worried voice, as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in
the middle of Grimmauld Place. “You look ever so pale. . . . Are you
sure you slept this morning? You go upstairs to bed right now, and
you can have a couple of hours’ sleep before dinner, all right?”
He nodded; here was a ready-made excuse not to talk to any of the
others, which was precisely what he wanted, so when she opened the
front door he proceeded straight past the troll’s leg umbrella stand and
up the stairs and hurried into his and Ron’s bedroom.
Here he began to pace up and down, past the two beds and Phineas
Nigellus’s empty portrait, his brain teeming and seething with ques-
tions and ever more dreadful ideas. . . .
How had he become a snake? Perhaps he was an Animagus. . . .
No, he couldn’t be, he would know. . . . perhaps Voldemort was an
Animagus. . . . Yes, thought Harry, that would fit, he would turn into
a snake of course . . . and when he’s possessing me, then we both trans-
form. . . . That still doesn’t explain how come I got to London and back
to my bed in the space of about five minutes, though. . . . But then
Voldemort’s about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from

493
CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
Dumbledore, it’s probably no problem at all to him to transport people
like that. . . .
And then, with a terrible stab of panic he thought, but this is in-
sane — if Voldemort’s possessing me, I’m giving him a clear view into the
headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now! He’ll know who’s in
the Order and where Sirius is . . . and I’ve heard loads of stuff I shouldn’t
have, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here. . . .
There was only one thing for it: He would have to leave Grim-
mauld Place straightaway. He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts
without the others, which would keep them safe over the holidays at
least. . . . But no, that wouldn’t do, there were still plenty of people at
Hogwarts to maim and injure, what if it was Seamus, Dean, or Neville
next time? He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigel-
lus’s empty frame. A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his
stomach. He had no alternative: He was going to have to return to
Privet Drive, cut himself off from other wizards entirely. . . .
Well, if he had to do it, he thought, there was no point hanging
around. Trying with all his might not to think how the Dursleys were
going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months ear-
lier than they had expected, he strode over to his trunk, slammed the
lid shut and locked it, then glanced around automatically for Hedwig
before remembering that she was still at Hogwarts — well, her cage
would be one less thing to carry — he seized one end of his trunk and
had dragged it halfway toward the door when a sneaky voice said,
“Running away, are we?”
He looked around. Phineas Nigellus had appeared upon the canvas
of his portrait and was leaning against the frame, watching Harry with
an amused expression on his face.
“Not running away, no,” said Harry shortly, dragging his trunk a
few more feet across the room.
“I thought,” said Phineas Nigellus, stroking his pointed beard,
“that to belong in Gryffindor House you were supposed to be brave?

494
CHRISTMAS ON THE
CLOSED WARD
It looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own
house. We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid. For instance,
given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks.”
“It’s not my own neck I’m saving,” said Harry tersely, tugging the
trunk over a patch of particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in
front of the door.
“Oh I see,” said Phineas Nigellus, still stroking his beard. “This is
no cowardly flight — you are being noble.”
Harry ignored him. His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas
Nigellus said lazily, “I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore.”
Harry spun around.
“What is it?”
“Stay where you are.”
“I haven’t moved!” said Harry, his hand still upon the doorknob.
“So what’s the message?”
“I have just given it to you, dolt,” said Phineas Nigellus smoothly.
“Dumbledore says, ‘Stay where you are.’ ”
“Why?” said Harry eagerly, dropping the end of his trunk. “Why
does he want me to stay? What else did he say?”
“Nothing whatsoever,” said Phineas Nigellus, raising a thin black
eyebrow as though he found Harry impertinent.
Harry’s temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long
grass. He was exhausted, he was confused beyond measure, he had ex-
perienced terror, relief, and then terror again in the last twelve hours,
and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him!
“So that’s it, is it?” he said loudly. “Stay there? That’s all anyone
could tell me after I got attacked by those dementors too! Just stay put
while the grown-ups sort it out, Harry! We won’t bother telling you
anything, though, because your tiny little brain might not be able to
cope with it!”
“You know,” said Phineas Nigellus, even more loudly than Harry,
“this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so


CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything.
Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there
might be an excellent reason why the headmaster of Hogwarts is not
confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you? Have you never paused,
while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore’s or-
ders has never yet led you into harm? No. No, like all young people,
you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognize
danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realize what the
Dark Lord may be planning. . . .”
“He is planning something to do with me, then?” said Harry
swiftly.
“Did I say that?” said Phineas Nigellus, idly examining his silk
gloves. “Now, if you will excuse me, I have better things to do than to
listen to adolescent agonizing. . . . Good day to you. . . .”
And he strolled into his frame and out of sight.
“Fine, go then!” Harry bellowed at the empty frame. “And tell
Dumbledore thanks for nothing!”
The empty canvas remained silent. Fuming, Harry dragged his
trunk back to the foot of his bed, then threw himself facedown upon
the moth-eaten covers, his eyes shut, his body heavy and aching. . . .
He felt he had journeyed miles and miles. . . . It seemed impossible
that less than twenty-four hours ago Cho Chang had been approach-
ing him under the mistletoe. . . . He was so tired. . . . He was scared to
sleep . . . yet he did not know how long he could fight it. . . . Dum-
bledore had told him to stay. . . . That must mean he was allowed to
sleep. . . . But he was scared. . . . What if it happened again . . . ?
He was sinking into shadows. . . .
It was as though a film in his head had been waiting to start. He
was walking down a deserted corridor toward a plain black door, past
rough stone walls, torches, and an open doorway onto a flight of stone
steps leading downstairs on the left. . . .
He reached the black door but could not open it. . . . He stood gaz-

496
CHRISTMAS ON THE
CLOSED WARD
ing at it, desperate for entry. . . . Something he wanted with all his heart
lay beyond. . . . A prize beyond his dreams. . . . If only his scar would
stop prickling . . . then he would be able to think more clearly. . . .
“Harry,” said Ron’s voice, from far, far away, “Mum says dinner’s
ready, but she’ll save you something if you want to stay in bed. . . .”
Harry opened his eyes, but Ron had already left the room.
He doesn’t want to be on his own with me, Harry thought. Not after
what he heard Moody say . . .
He supposed none of them would want him there anymore now
that they knew what was inside him. . . .
He would not go down to dinner; he would not inflict his company
upon them. He turned over onto his other side and after a while
dropped back off to sleep, waking much later in the early hours of the
morning, with his insides aching with hunger, and Ron snoring in the
next bed. Squinting around the room he saw the dark outline of
Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to
Harry that Dumbledore had probably set Phineas Nigellus to watch
over him, in case he attacked somebody else.
The feeling of being unclean intensified. He half wished he had not
obeyed Dumbledore and stayed. . . . If this was how life was going to
be in Grimmauld Place from now on, maybe he would be better off in
Privet Drive after all.
Everybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas
decorations. Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a
good mood; he was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that
he was to have company over Christmas. Harry could hear his voice
echoing up through the floor in the cold and empty drawing room
where he was sitting alone, watching the sky outside the windows
growing whiter, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage plea-
sure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking
about him, as they were bound to be doing. When he heard Mrs.

497
CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime he re-
treated farther upstairs and ignored her.
It was around six o’clock in the evening that the doorbell rang and
Mrs. Black started screaming again. Assuming that Mundungus or
some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled
himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak the hip-
pogriff’s room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry he
felt as he fed Buckbeak dead rats. It came as a slight shock when some-
body hammered hard on the door a few minutes later.
“I know you’re in there,” said Hermione’s voice. “Will you please
come out? I want to talk to you.”
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked her, pulling open the door,
as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any
fragments of rat he might have dropped. “I thought you were skiing
with your mum and dad.”
“Well, to tell the truth, skiing’s not really my thing,” said Hermi-
one. “So I’ve come for Christmas.” There was snow in her hair and her
face was pink with cold. “But don’t tell Ron that, I told him it’s really
good because he kept laughing so much. Anyway, Mum and Dad are
a bit disappointed, but I’ve told them that everyone who’s serious
about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study. They want me to do
well, they’ll understand. Anyway,” she said briskly, “let’s go to your
bedroom, Ron’s mum’s lit a fire in there and she’s sent up sandwiches.”
Harry followed her back to the second floor. When he entered the
bedroom he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting
for them, sitting on Ron’s bed.
“I came on the Knight Bus,” said Hermione airily, pulling off her
jacket before Harry had time to speak. “Dumbledore told me what
had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to
end officially before setting off. Umbridge is already livid that you lot
disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her

498
CHRISTMAS ON THE
CLOSED WARD
Mr. Weasley was in St. Mungo’s, and he’d given you all permission to
visit. So . . .”
She sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron looked up
at Harry.
“How’re you feeling?” asked Hermione.
“Fine,” said Harry stiffly.
“Oh, don’t lie, Harry,” she said impatiently. “Ron and Ginny say
you’ve been hiding from everyone since you got back from St.
Mungo’s.”
“They do, do they?” said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny. Ron
looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed.
“Well, you have!” she said. “And you won’t look at any of us!”
“It’s you lot who won’t look at me!” said Harry angrily.
“Maybe you’re taking it in turns to look and keep missing each
other,” suggested Hermione, the corners of her mouth twitching.
“Very funny,” snapped Harry, turning away.
“Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,” said Hermione sharply.
“Look, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the
Extendable Ears —”
“Yeah?” growled Harry, his hands deep in his pockets as he watched
the snow now falling thickly outside. “All been talking about me, have
you? Well, I’m getting used to it. . . .”
“We wanted to talk to you, Harry,” said Ginny, “but as you’ve been
hiding ever since we got back —”
“I didn’t want anyone to talk to me,” said Harry, who was feeling
more and more nettled.
“Well, that was a bit stupid of you,” said Ginny angrily, “seeing as
you don’t know anyone but me who’s been possessed by You-Know-
Who, and I can tell you how it feels.”
Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him.
Then he turned on the spot to face her.

499
CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
“I forgot,” he said.
“Lucky you,” said Ginny coolly.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, and he meant it. “So . . . so do you think
I’m being possessed, then?”
“Well, can you remember everything you’ve been doing?” Ginny
asked. “Are there big blank periods where you don’t know what you’ve
been up to?”
Harry racked his brains.
“No,” he said.
“Then You-Know-Who hasn’t ever possessed you,” said Ginny sim-
ply. “When he did it to me, I couldn’t remember what I’d been doing
for hours at a time. I’d find myself somewhere and not know how I
got there.”
Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost
in spite of himself.
“That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though —”
“Harry, you’ve had these dreams before,” Hermione said. “You had
flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.”
“This was different,” said Harry, shaking his head. “I was inside
that snake. It was like I was the snake. . . . What if Voldemort some-
how transported me to London — ?”
“One day,” said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated,
“you’ll read Hogwarts, A History, and perhaps that will remind you
that you can’t Apparate or Disapparate inside Hogwarts. Even Volde-
mort couldn’t just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry.”
“You didn’t leave your bed, mate,” said Ron. “I saw you thrashing
around in your sleep about a minute before we could wake you up. . . .”
Harry started pacing up and down the room again, thinking. What
they were all saying was not only comforting, it made sense. . . .
Without really thinking he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed
and crammed it hungrily into his mouth. . . .
I’m not the weapon after all, thought Harry. His heart swelled with

500
CHRISTMAS ON THE
CLOSED WARD
happiness and relief, and he felt like joining in as they heard Sirius
tramping past their door toward Buckbeak’s room, singing “God Rest
Ye Merry, Hippogriffs” at the top of his voice.
How could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christ-
mas? Sirius’s delight at having the house full again, and especially at
having Harry back, was infectious. He was no longer their sullen host
of the summer; now he seemed determined that everyone should en-
joy themselves as much, if not more, than they would have done at
Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day,
cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the time they all
went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognizable. The
tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with
garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered
in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained
by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Sirius’s family
tree from view; and even the stuffed elf heads on the hall wall wore Fa-
ther Christmas hats and beards.
Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at
the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own,
rather larger, pile.
“Good haul this year,” he informed Harry through a cloud of pa-
per. “Thanks for the Broom Compass, it’s excellent, beats Hermi-
one’s — she’s got me a homework planner —”
Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermione’s
handwriting on it. She had given him too a book that resembled a di-
ary, except that it said things like “Do it today or later you’ll pay!” every
time he opened a page.
Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled
Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had
superb, moving color illustrations of all the counterjinxes and hexes it
described. Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see


it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the D.A. Hagrid had
sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably sup-
posed to be an antitheft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry
putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off. Tonks’s
present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry
watched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version;
Ron had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavor Beans; Mr. and
Mrs. Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies;
and Dobby, a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been
done by the elf himself. He had just turned it upside down to see
whether it looked better that way when, with a loud crack, Fred and
George Apparated at the foot of his bed.
“Merry Christmas,” said George. “Don’t go downstairs for a bit.”
“Why not?” said Ron.
“Mum’s crying again,” said Fred heavily. “Percy sent back his
Christmas jumper.”
“Without a note,” added George. “Hasn’t asked how Dad is or vis-
ited him or anything. . . .”
“We tried to comfort her,” said Fred, moving around the bed to
look at Harry’s portrait. “Told her Percy’s nothing more than a hu-
mongous pile of rat droppings —”
“— didn’t work,” said George, helping himself to a Chocolate
Frog. “So Lupin took over. Best let him cheer her up before we go
down for breakfast, I reckon.”
“What’s that supposed to be anyway?” asked Fred, squinting at
Dobby’s painting. “Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes.”
“It’s Harry!” said George, pointing at the back of the picture. “Says
so on the back!”
“Good likeness,” said Fred, grinning. Harry threw his new home-
work diary at him; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it
said happily, “If you’ve dotted the i’s and crossed the t’s then you may do
whatever you please!”

502
CHRISTMAS ON THE

They got up and dressed; they could hear various inhabitants of the
house calling “Merry Christmas” to each other. On their way down-
stairs they met Hermione. “Thanks for the book, Harry!” she said
happily. “I’ve been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages!
And that perfume is really unusual, Ron.”
“No problem,” said Ron. “Who’s that for anyway?” he added, nod-
ding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying.
“Kreacher,” said Hermione brightly.
“It had better not be clothes!” said Ron warningly. “You know what
Sirius said, Kreacher knows too much, we can’t set him free!”
“It isn’t clothes,” said Hermione, “although if I had my way I’d cer-
tainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No,
it’s a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom.”
“What bedroom?” said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as
they were passing the portrait of Sirius’s mother.
“Well, Sirius says it’s not so much a bedroom, more a kind of —
den,” said Hermione. “Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that
cupboard off the kitchen.”
Mrs. Weasley was the only person in the basement when they ar-
rived there. She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she
had a bad head cold when she wished them Merry Christmas, and
they all averted their eyes.
“So, this is Kreacher’s bedroom?” said Ron, strolling over to a dingy
door in the corner opposite the pantry which Harry had never seen
open.
“Yes,” said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous. “Er . . . I
think we’d better knock . . .”
Ron rapped the door with his knuckles but there was no reply.
“He must be sneaking around upstairs,” he said, and without fur-
ther ado pulled open the door. “Urgh.”
Harry peered inside. Most of the cupboard was taken up with a
very large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot’s space underneath


CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a
nest. A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on
the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where
Kreacher curled up to sleep every night. Here and there among the
material were stale bread crusts and moldy old bits of cheese. In a far
corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher
had saved, magpielike, from Sirius’s purge of the house, and he had
also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that
Sirius had thrown away over the summer. Their glass might be shat-
tered, but still the little black-and-white people inside them peered
haughtily up at him, including — he felt a little jolt in his stomach —
the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dum-
bledore’s Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange. By the looks of it, hers was
Kreacher’s favorite photograph; he had placed it to the fore of all the
others and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape.
“I think I’ll just leave his present here,” said Hermione, laying the
package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets
and closing the door quietly. “He’ll find it later, that’ll be fine. . . .”
“Come to think of it,” said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carry-
ing a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door, “has anyone
actually seen Kreacher lately?”
“I haven’t seen him since the night we came back here,” said Harry.
“You were ordering him out of the kitchen.”
“Yeah . . .” said Sirius, frowning. “You know, I think that’s the last
time I saw him, too. . . . He must be hiding upstairs somewhere. . . .”
“He couldn’t have left, could he?” said Harry. “I mean, when you
said ‘out,’ maybe he thought you meant, get out of the house?”
“No, no, house-elves can’t leave unless they’re given clothes, they’re
tied to their family’s house,” said Sirius.
“They can leave the house if they really want to,” Harry contra-
dicted him. “Dobby did, he left the Malfoys’ to give me warnings two
years ago. He had to punish himself afterward, but he still managed it.”


Sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment, then said, “I’ll
look for him later, I expect I’ll find him upstairs crying his eyes out
over my mother’s old bloomers or something. . . . Of course, he might
have crawled into the airing cupboard and died. . . . But I mustn’t get
my hopes up. . . .”
Fred, George, and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked
reproachful.
Once they had had their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys and Harry
and Hermione were planning to pay Mr. Weasley another visit, es-
corted by Mad-Eye and Lupin. Mundungus turned up in time for
Christmas pudding and trifle, having managed to “borrow” a car for
the occasion, as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day. The
car, which Harry doubted very much had been taken with the knowl-
edge or consent of its owner, had had a similar Enlarging Spell put
upon it as the Weasleys’ old Ford Anglia; although normally propor-
tioned outside, ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit
into it quite comfortably. Mrs. Weasley hesitated at the point of get-
ting inside; Harry knew that her disapproval of Mundungus was bat-
tling with her dislike of traveling without magic; finally the cold
outside and her children’s pleading triumphed, and she settled herself
into the backseat between Fred and Bill with good grace.
The journey to St. Mungo’s was quite quick, as there was very little
traffic on the roads. A small trickle of witches and wizards were creep-
ing furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital.
Harry and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off
around the corner to wait for them; they strolled casually toward the
window where the dummy in green nylon stood, then, one by one,
stepped through the glass.
The reception area looked pleasantly festive: The crystal orbs that
illuminated St. Mungo’s had been turned to red and gold so that they
became gigantic, glowing Christmas baubles; holly hung around every
doorway, and shining white Christmas trees covered in magical snow


CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
and icicles glittered in every corner, each topped with a gleaming gold
star. It was less crowded than the last time they had been there, al-
though halfway across the room Harry found himself shunted aside
by a witch with a walnut jammed up her left nostril.
“Family argument, eh?” smirked the blonde witch behind the desk.
“You’re the third I’ve seen today . . . Spell Damage, fourth floor . . .”
They found Mr. Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his
turkey dinner on a tray in his lap and a rather sheepish expression on
his face.
“Everything all right, Arthur?” asked Mrs. Weasley, after they had
all greeted Mr. Weasley and handed over their presents.
“Fine, fine,” said Mr. Weasley, a little too heartily. “You — er —
haven’t seen Healer Smethwyck, have you?”
“No,” said Mrs. Weasley suspiciously, “why?”
“Nothing, nothing,” said Mr. Weasley airily, starting to unwrap his
pile of gifts. “Well, everyone had a good day? What did you all get for
Christmas? Oh, Harry — this is absolutely wonderful —”
For he had just opened Harry’s gift of fuse-wire and screwdrivers.
Mrs. Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr. Weasley’s an-
swer. As her husband leaned over to shake Harry’s hand, she peered at
the bandaging under his nightshirt.
“Arthur,” she said, with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap,
“you’ve had your bandages changed. Why have you had your ban-
dages changed a day early, Arthur? They told me they wouldn’t need
doing until tomorrow.”
“What?” said Mr. Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the
bed covers higher up his chest. “No, no — it’s nothing — it’s — I —”
He seemed to deflate under Mrs. Weasley’s piercing gaze.
“Well — now don’t get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an
idea. . . . He’s the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and
very interested in . . . um . . . complementary medicine. . . . I mean,

506
CHRISTMAS ON THE
CLOSED WARD
some of these old Muggle remedies . . . well, they’re called stitches,
Molly, and they work very well on — on Muggle wounds —”
Mrs. Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a
shriek and a snarl. Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the
werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the
crowd around Mr. Weasley; Bill muttered something about getting
himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him,
grinning.
“Do you mean to tell me,” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice growing
louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visi-
tors were scurrying for cover, “that you have been messing about with
Muggle remedies?”
“Not messing about, Molly, dear,” said Mr. Weasley imploringly.
“It was just — just something Pye and I thought we’d try — only,
most unfortunately — well, with these particular kinds of wounds —
it doesn’t seem to work as well as we’d hoped —”
“Meaning?”
“Well . . . well, I don’t know whether you know what — what
stitches are?”
“It sounds as though you’ve been trying to sew your skin back to-
gether,” said Mrs. Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter, “but
even you, Arthur, wouldn’t be that stupid —”
“I fancy a cup of tea too,” said Harry, jumping to his feet.
Hermione, Ron, and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him.
As it swung closed behind them, they heard Mrs. Weasley shriek,
“WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT’S THE GENERAL IDEA?”
“Typical Dad,” said Ginny, shaking her head as they set off up the
corridor. “Stitches . . . I ask you . . .”
“Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,” said
Hermione fairly. “I suppose something in that snake’s venom dissolves
them or something. . . . I wonder where the tearoom is?”

507
CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
“Fifth floor,” said Harry, remembering the sign over the Welcome
Witch’s desk.
They walked along the corridor through a set of double doors and
found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutal-looking
Healers. As they climbed it, the various Healers called out to them, di-
agnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies. Ron was
seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly
had a bad case of spattergroit.
“And what’s that supposed to be?” he asked angrily, as the Healer
pursued him through six more portraits, shoving the occupants out of
the way.
“ ’Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin, young master, that will
leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now —”
“Watch who you’re calling gruesome!” said Ron, his ears turning red.
“The only remedy is to take the liver of a toad, bind it tight about
your throat, stand naked by the full moon in a barrel of eels’ eyes —”
“I have not got spattergroit!”
“But the unsightly blemishes upon your visage, young master —”
“They’re freckles!” said Ron furiously. “Now get back in your own
picture and leave me alone!”
He rounded on the others, who were all keeping determinedly
straight faces.
“What floor’s this?”
“I think it’s the fifth,” said Hermione.
“Nah, it’s the fourth,” said Harry, “one more —”
But as he stepped onto the landing he came to an abrupt halt, star-
ing at the small window set into the double doors that marked the
start of a corridor signposted spell damage. A man was peering out
at them all with his nose pressed against the glass. He had wavy blond
hair, bright blue eyes, and a broad vacant smile that revealed daz-
zlingly white teeth.

508
CHRISTMAS ON THE
CLOSED WARD
“Blimey!” said Ron, also staring at the man.
“Oh my goodness,” said Hermione suddenly, sounding breathless.
“Professor Lockhart!”
Their ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher pushed open the
doors and moved toward them, wearing a long lilac dressing gown.
“Well, hello there!” he said. “I expect you’d like my autograph,
would you?”
“Hasn’t changed much, has he?” Harry muttered to Ginny, who
grinned.
“Er — how are you, Professor?” said Ron, sounding slightly guilty.
It had been Ron’s malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor
Lockhart’s memory so badly that he had landed here in the first place,
though, as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe Harry
and Ron’s memories at the time, Harry’s sympathy was limited.
“I’m very well indeed, thank you!” said Lockhart exuberantly,
pulling a rather battered peacock-feather quill from his pocket. “Now,
how many autographs would you like? I can do joined-up writing
now, you know!”
“Er — we don’t want any at the moment, thanks,” said Ron, rais-
ing his eyebrows at Harry, who asked, “Professor, should you be wan-
dering around the corridors? Shouldn’t you be in a ward?”
The smile faded slowly from Lockhart’s face. For a few moments he
gazed intently at Harry, then he said, “Haven’t we met?”
“Er . . . yeah, we have,” said Harry. “You used to teach us at Hog-
warts, remember?”
“Teach?” repeated Lockhart, looking faintly unsettled. “Me? Did I?”
And then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was
rather alarming. “Taught you everything you know, I expect, did I?
Well, how about those autographs, then? Shall we say a round dozen,
you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left
out!”

509
CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
But just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the cor-
ridor and a voice said, “Gilderoy, you naughty boy, where have you
wandered off to?”
A motherly looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came
bustling up the corridor, smiling warmly at Harry and the others.
“Oh Gilderoy, you’ve got visitors! How lovely, and on Christmas
Day too! Do you know, he never gets visitors, poor lamb, and I can’t
think why, he’s such a sweetie, aren’t you?”
“We’re doing autographs!” Gilderoy told the Healer with another
glittering smile. “They want loads of them, won’t take no for an an-
swer! I just hope we’ve got enough photographs!”
“Listen to him,” said the Healer, taking Lockhart’s arm and beam-
ing fondly at him as though he were a precocious two-year-old. “He
was rather well known a few years ago; we very much hope that this
liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be com-
ing back a little bit. Will you step this way? He’s in a closed ward, you
know, he must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas
presents, the door’s usually kept locked . . . not that he’s dangerous!
But,” she lowered her voice to a whisper, “bit of a danger to himself,
bless him. . . . Doesn’t know who he is, you see, wanders off and can’t
remember how to get back. . . . It is nice of you to have come to see
him —”
“Er,” said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, “actually,
we were just — er —”
But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Ron’s feeble
mutter of “going to have a cup of tea” trailed away into nothingness.
They looked at one another rather hopelessly and then followed Lock-
hart and his Healer along the corridor.
“Let’s not stay long,” Ron said quietly.
The Healer pointed her wand at the door of the Janus Thickey
ward and muttered “Alohomora.” The door swung open and she led

510
CHRISTMAS ON THE
CLOSED WARD
the way inside, keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoy’s arm until she had
settled him into an armchair beside his bed.
“This is our long-term resident ward,” she informed Harry, Ron,
Hermione, and Ginny in a low voice. “For permanent spell damage,
you know. Of course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and
a bit of luck, we can produce some improvement. . . . Gilderoy does
seem to be getting back some sense of himself, and we’ve seen a real
improvement in Mr. Bode, he seems to be regaining the power of
speech very well, though he isn’t speaking any language we recognize
yet. . . . Well, I must finish giving out the Christmas presents, I’ll
leave you all to chat. . . .”
Harry looked around; this ward bore unmistakable signs of being a
permanent home to its residents. They had many more personal ef-
fects around their beds than in Mr. Weasley’s ward; the wall around
Gilderoy’s headboard, for instance, was papered with pictures of him-
self, all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals. He had au-
tographed many of them to himself in disjointed, childish writing.
The moment he had been deposited in his chair by the Healer,
Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs toward him, seized a
quill, and started signing them all feverishly.
“You can put them in envelopes,” he said to Ginny, throwing the
signed pictures into her lap one by one as he finished them. “I am not
forgotten, you know, no, I still receive a very great deal of fan mail.
. . . Gladys Gudgeon writes weekly. . . . I just wish I knew why. . . .”
He paused, looking faintly puzzled, then beamed again and returned
to his signing with renewed vigor. “I suspect it is simply my good
looks. . . .”
A sallow-skinned, mournful-looking wizard lay in the bed oppo-
site, staring at the ceiling; he was mumbling to himself and seemed
quite unaware of anything around him. Two beds along was a woman
whose entire head was covered in fur; Harry remembered something

511
CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
similar happening to Hermione during their second year, although
fortunately the damage, in her case, had not been permanent. At the
far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds
to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy.
“Here you are, Agnes,” said the Healer brightly to the furry-faced
woman, handing her a small pile of Christmas presents. “See, not for-
gotten, are you? And your son’s sent an owl to say he’s visiting tonight,
so that’s nice, isn’t it?”
Agnes gave several loud barks.
“And look, Broderick, you’ve been sent a potted plant and a lovely
calendar with a different fancy hippogriff for each month, they’ll
brighten things up, won’t they?” said the Healer, bustling along to the
mumbling man, setting a rather ugly plant with long, swaying tenta-
cles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her
wand. “And — oh, Mrs. Longbottom, are you leaving already?”
Harry’s head spun round. The curtains had been drawn back from
the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking
back down the aisle between the beds: a formidable-looking old witch
wearing a long green dress, a moth-eaten fox fur, and a pointed hat
decorated with what was unmistakably a stuffed vulture and, trailing
behind her looking thoroughly depressed — Neville.
With a sudden rush of understanding, Harry realized who the
people in the end beds must be. He cast around wildly for some
means of distracting the others so that Neville could leave the ward
unnoticed and unquestioned, but Ron had looked up at the sound of
the name “Longbottom” too, and before Harry could stop him had
called, “Neville!”
Neville jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly
missed him.
“It’s us, Neville!” said Ron brightly, getting to his feet. “Have you
seen? Lockhart’s here! Who’ve you been visiting?”

512
CHRISTMAS ON THE
CLOSED WARD
“Friends of yours, Neville, dear?” said Neville’s grandmother gra-
ciously, bearing down upon them all.
Neville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world
but here. A dull purple flush was creeping up his plump face and he
was not making eye contact with any of them.
“Ah, yes,” said his grandmother, looking closely at Harry and stick-
ing out a shriveled, clawlike hand for him to shake. “Yes, yes, I know
who you are, of course. Neville speaks most highly of you.”
“Er — thanks,” said Harry, shaking hands. Neville did not look at
him, but stared at his own feet, the color deepening in his face all the
while.
“And you two are clearly Weasleys,” Mrs. Longbottom continued,
proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn. “Yes, I know
your parents — not well, of course — but fine people, fine people . . .
and you must be Hermione Granger?”
Hermione looked rather startled that Mrs. Longbottom knew her
name, but shook hands all the same.
“Yes, Neville’s told me all about you. Helped him out of a few
sticky spots, haven’t you? He’s a good boy,” she said, casting a sternly
appraising look down her rather bony nose at Neville, “but he hasn’t
got his father’s talent, I’m afraid to say. . . .” And she jerked her head
in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward, so that the
stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly.
“What?” said Ron, looking amazed (Harry wanted to stamp on
Ron’s foot, but that sort of thing was much harder to bring off unno-
ticed when you were wearing jeans rather than robes). “Is that your
dad down the end, Neville?”
“What’s this?” said Mrs. Longbottom sharply. “Haven’t you told
your friends about your parents, Neville?”
Neville took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling, and shook
his head. Harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone,

513
CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
but he could not think of any way of helping Neville out of the
situation.
“Well, it’s nothing to be ashamed of!” said Mrs. Longbottom an-
grily. “You should be proud, Neville, proud ! They didn’t give their
health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them,
you know!”
“I’m not ashamed,” said Neville very faintly, still looking anywhere
but at Harry and the others. Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look
over at the inhabitants of the two beds.
“Well, you’ve got a funny way of showing it!” said Mrs. Longbot-
tom. “My son and his wife,” she said, turning haughtily to Harry,
Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, “were tortured into insanity by You-
Know-Who’s followers.”
Hermione and Ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths.
Ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of Neville’s parents
and looked mortified.
“They were Aurors, you know, and very well respected within the
Wizarding community,” Mrs. Longbottom went on. “Highly gifted,
the pair of them. I — yes, Alice dear, what is it?”
Neville’s mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress.
She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in
Moody’s old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix. Her
face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge, and her hair,
which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She did not
seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made
timid motions toward Neville, holding something in her outstretched
hand.
“Again?” said Mrs. Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. “Very
well, Alice dear, very well — Neville, take it, whatever it is. . . .”
But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his
mother dropped an empty Droobles Blowing Gum wrapper.
“Very nice, dear,” said Neville’s grandmother in a falsely cheery

514
CHRISTMAS ON THE
CLOSED WARD
voice, patting his mother on the shoulder. But Neville said quietly,
“Thanks Mum.”
His mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself.
Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though
daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he’d ever found any-
thing less funny in his life.
“Well, we’d better get back,” sighed Mrs. Longbottom, drawing on
long green gloves. “Very nice to have met you all. Neville, put that
wrapper in the bin, she must have given you enough of them to paper
your bedroom by now. . . .”
But as they left, Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the wrapper into
his pocket.
The door closed behind them.
“I never knew,” said Hermione, who looked tearful.
“Nor did I,” said Ron rather hoarsely.
“Nor me,” whispered Ginny.
They all looked at Harry.
“I did,” he said glumly. “Dumbledore told me but I promised I
wouldn’t mention it . . . that’s what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to
Azkaban for, using the Cruciatus Curse on Neville’s parents until they
lost their minds.”
“Bellatrix Lestrange did that?” whispered Hermione, horrified.
“That woman Kreacher’s got a photo of in his den?”
There was a long silence, broken by Lockhart’s angry voice. “Look,
I didn’t learn joined-up writing for nothing, you know!”

K
reacher, it transpired, had been lurking in the attic. Sirius said
he had found him up there, covered in dust, no doubt looking
for more relics of the Black family to hide in his cupboard. Though
Sirius seemed satisfied with this story, it made Harry uneasy. Kreacher
seemed to be in a better mood on his reappearance, his bitter mutter-
ing had subsided somewhat, and he submitted to orders more docilely
than usual, though once or twice Harry caught the house-elf staring
avidly at him, always looking quickly away when he saw that Harry
had noticed.
Harry did not mention his vague suspicions to Sirius, whose cheer-
fulness was evaporating fast now that Christmas was over. As the date
of their departure back to Hogwarts drew nearer, he became more and
more prone to what Mrs. Weasley called “fits of the sullens,” in which
he would become taciturn and grumpy, often withdrawing to Buck-
beak’s room for hours at a time. His gloom seeped through the house,
oozing under doorways like some noxious gas, so that all of them be-
came infected by it.
Harry did not want to leave Sirius all alone again with only Kreacher

516
OCCLUMENCY
for company. In fact, for the first time in his life, he was not looking
forward to returning to Hogwarts. Going back to school would mean
placing himself once again under the tyranny of Dolores Umbridge,
who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in
their absence. Then there was no Quidditch to look forward to now
that he had been banned; there was every likelihood that their burden
of homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer; Dumble-
dore remained as remote as ever; in fact, if it had not been for the D.A.,
Harry felt he might have gone to Sirius and begged him to let him leave
Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place.
Then, on the very last day of the holidays, something happened
that made Harry positively dread his return to school.
“Harry dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, poking her head into his and
Ron’s bedroom, where the pair of them were playing wizard chess
watched by Hermione, Ginny, and Crookshanks, “could you come
down to the kitchen? Professor Snape would like a word with you.”
Harry did not immediately register what she had said; one of his
castles was engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of Ron’s, and he
was egging it on enthusiastically.
“Squash him — squash him, he’s only a pawn, you idiot — sorry,
Mrs. Weasley, what did you say?”
“Professor Snape, dear. In the kitchen. He’d like a word.”
Harry’s mouth fell open in horror. He looked around at Ron,
Hermione, and Ginny, all of whom were gaping back at him. Crook-
shanks, whom Hermione had been restraining with difficulty for the
past quarter of an hour, leapt gleefully upon the board and set the
pieces running for cover, squealing at the top of their voices.
“Snape?” said Harry blankly.
“Professor Snape, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley reprovingly. “Now come
on, quickly, he says he can’t stay long.”
“What’s he want with you?” said Ron, looking unnerved as Mrs.
Weasley withdrew from the room.

517
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
“You haven’t done anything, have you?”
“No!” said Harry indignantly, racking his brains to think what he
could have done that would make Snape pursue him to Grimmauld
Place. Had his last piece of homework perhaps earned a T?
He pushed open the kitchen door a minute or two later to find Sir-
ius and Snape both seated at the long kitchen table, glaring in oppo-
site directions. The silence between them was heavy with mutual
dislike. A letter lay open on the table in front of Sirius.
“Er,” said Harry to announce his presence.
Snape looked around at him, his face framed between curtains of
greasy black hair.
“Sit down, Potter.”
“You know,” said Sirius loudly, leaning back on his rear chair legs
and speaking to the ceiling, “I think I’d prefer it if you didn’t give or-
ders here, Snape. It’s my house, you see.”
An ugly flush suffused Snape’s pallid face. Harry sat down in a chair
beside Sirius, facing Snape across the table.
“I was supposed to see you alone, Potter,” said Snape, the familiar
sneer curling his mouth, “but Black —”
“I’m his godfather,” said Sirius, louder than ever.
“I am here on Dumbledore’s orders,” said Snape, whose voice, by
contrast, was becoming more and more quietly waspish, “but by all
means stay, Black, I know you like to feel . . . involved.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” said Sirius, letting his chair fall
back onto all four legs with a loud bang.
“Merely that I am sure you must feel — ah — frustrated by the fact
that you can do nothing useful,” Snape laid a delicate stress on the
word, “for the Order.”
It was Sirius’s turn to flush. Snape’s lip curled in triumph as he
turned to Harry.
“The headmaster has sent me to tell you, Potter, that it is his wish
for you to study Occlumency this term.”

518
OCCLUMENCY
“Study what?” said Harry blankly.
Snape’s sneer became more pronounced.
“Occlumency, Potter. The magical defense of the mind against ex-
ternal penetration. An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful
one.
Harry’s heart began to pump very fast indeed. Defense against ex-
ternal penetration? But he was not being possessed, they had all
agreed on that. . . .
“Why do I have to study Occlu — thing?” he blurted out.
“Because the headmaster thinks it a good idea,” said Snape
smoothly. “You will receive private lessons once a week, but you will
not tell anybody what you are doing, least of all Dolores Umbridge.
You understand?”
“Yes,” said Harry. “Who’s going to be teaching me?”
Snape raised an eyebrow.
“I am,” he said.
Harry had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting. Ex-
tra lessons with Snape — what on earth had he done to deserve this?
He looked quickly around at Sirius for support.
“Why can’t Dumbledore teach Harry?” asked Sirius aggressively.
“Why you?”
“I suppose because it is a headmaster’s privilege to delegate less en-
joyable tasks,” said Snape silkily. “I assure you I did not beg for the
job.” He got to his feet. “I will expect you at six o’clock on Monday
evening, Potter. My office. If anybody asks, you are taking Remedial
Potions. Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need
them.”
He turned to leave, his black traveling cloak billowing behind him.
“Wait a moment,” said Sirius, sitting up straighter in his chair.
Snape turned back to face them, sneering.
“I am in rather a hurry, Black . . . unlike you, I do not have unlim-
ited leisure time. . . .”

“I’ll get to the point, then,” said Sirius, standing up. He was rather
taller than Snape who, Harry noticed, had balled his fist in the pocket
of his cloak over what Harry was sure was the handle of his wand. “If
I hear you’re using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard
time, you’ll have me to answer to.”
“How touching,” Snape sneered. “But surely you have noticed that
Potter is very like his father?”
“Yes, I have,” said Sirius proudly.
“Well then, you’ll know he’s so arrogant that criticism simply
bounces off him,” Snape said sleekly.
Sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table
toward Snape, pulling out his wand as he went; Snape whipped out
his own. They were squaring up to each other, Sirius looking livid,
Snape calculating, his eyes darting from Sirius’s wand tip to his face.
“Sirius!” said Harry loudly, but Sirius appeared not to hear him.
“I’ve warned you, Snivellus,” said Sirius, his face barely a foot from
Snape’s, “I don’t care if Dumbledore thinks you’ve reformed, I know
better —”
“Oh, but why don’t you tell him so?” whispered Snape. “Or are you
afraid he might not take the advice of a man who has been hiding in-
side his mother’s house for six months very seriously?”
“Tell me, how is Lucius Malfoy these days? I expect he’s delighted
his lapdog’s working at Hogwarts, isn’t he?”
“Speaking of dogs,” said Snape softly, “did you know that Lucius
Malfoy recognized you last time you risked a little jaunt outside?
Clever idea, Black, getting yourself seen on a safe station platform . . .
gave you a cast-iron excuse not to leave your hidey-hole in future,
didn’t it?”
Sirius raised his wand.
“NO!” Harry yelled, vaulting over the table and trying to get in be-
tween them, “Sirius, don’t —”


OCCLUMENCY
“Are you calling me a coward?” roared Sirius, trying to push Harry
out of the way, but Harry would not budge.
“Why, yes, I suppose I am,” said Snape.
“Harry — get — out — of — it!” snarled Sirius, pushing him out
of the way with his free hand.
The kitchen door opened and the entire Weasley family, plus
Hermione, came inside, all looking very happy, with Mr. Weasley
walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pajamas
covered by a mackintosh.
“Cured!” he announced brightly to the kitchen at large. “Com-
pletely cured!”
He and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold, gazing at the
scene in front of them, which was also suspended in mid-action, both
Sirius and Snape looking toward the door with their wands pointing
into each other’s faces and Harry immobile between them, a hand
stretched out to each of them, trying to force them apart.
“Merlin’s beard,” said Mr. Weasley, the smile sliding off his face,
“what’s going on here?”
Both Sirius and Snape lowered their wands. Harry looked from one
to the other. Each wore an expression of utmost contempt, yet the
unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought
them to their senses. Snape pocketed his wand and swept back across
the kitchen, passing the Weasleys without comment. At the door he
looked back.
“Six o’clock Monday evening, Potter.”
He was gone. Sirius glared after him, his wand at his side.
“But what’s been going on?” asked Mr. Weasley again.
“Nothing, Arthur,” said Sirius, who was breathing heavily as though
he had just run a long distance. “Just a friendly little chat between two
old school friends. . . .” With what looked like an enormous effort, he
smiled. “So . . . you’re cured? That’s great news, really great. . . .”

CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
“Yes, isn’t it?” said Mrs. Weasley, leading her husband forward into
a chair. “Healer Smethwyck worked his magic in the end, found an
antidote to whatever that snake’s got in its fangs, and Arthur’s learned
his lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine, haven’t you, dear?” she
added, rather menacingly.
“Yes, Molly dear,” said Mr. Weasley meekly.
That night’s meal should have been a cheerful one with Mr.
Weasley back amongst them; Harry could tell Sirius was trying to
make it so, yet when his godfather was not forcing himself to laugh
loudly at Fred and George’s jokes or offering everyone more food, his
face fell back into a moody, brooding expression. Harry was separated
from him by Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to offer
Mr. Weasley their congratulations; he wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell
him that he should not listen to a word Snape said, that Snape was
goading him deliberately and that the rest of them did not think Sir-
ius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in
Grimmauld Place, but he had no opportunity to do so, and wondered
occasionally, eyeing the ugly look on Sirius’s face, whether he would
have dared to even if he had the chance. Instead he told Ron and
Hermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons
with Snape.
“Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Volde-
mort,” said Hermione at once. “Well, you won’t be sorry not to have
them anymore, will you?”
“Extra lessons with Snape?” said Ron, sounding aghast. “I’d rather
have the nightmares!”
They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following
day, escorted once again by Tonks and Lupin, both of whom were eat-
ing breakfast in the kitchen when Harry, Ron, and Hermione arrived
there next morning. The adults seemed to have been midway through
a whispered conversation when the door opened; all of them looked
around hastily and fell silent.


OCCLUMENCY
After a hurried breakfast they pulled on jackets and scarves against
the chilly gray January morning. Harry had an unpleasant constricted
sensation in his chest; he did not want to say good-bye to Sirius. He
had a bad feeling about this parting; he did not know when they
would next see each other and felt that it was incumbent upon him to
say something to Sirius to stop him doing anything stupid — Harry
was worried that Snape’s accusation of cowardice had stung Sirius so
badly he might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond
Grimmauld Place. Before he could think of what to say, however, Sir-
ius had beckoned him to his side.
“I want you to take this,” he said quietly, thrusting a badly wrapped
package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harry’s hands.
“What is it?” Harry asked.
“A way of letting me know if Snape’s giving you a hard time. No,
don’t open it in here!” said Sirius, with a wary look at Mrs. Weasley,
who was trying to persuade the twins to wear hand-knitted mittens. “I
doubt Molly would approve — but I want you to use it if you need
me, all right?”
“Okay,” said Harry, stowing the package away in the inside pocket
of his jacket, but he knew he would never use whatever it was. It
would not be he, Harry, who lured Sirius from his place of safety, no
matter how foully Snape treated him in their forthcoming Occlu-
mency classes.
“Let’s go, then,” said Sirius, clapping Harry on the shoulder and
smiling grimly, and before Harry could say anything else, they were
heading upstairs, stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front
door, surrounded by Weasleys.
“Good-bye, Harry, take care,” said Mrs. Weasley, hugging him.
“See you Harry, and keep an eye out for snakes for me!” said Mr.
Weasley genially, shaking his hand.
“Right — yeah,” said Harry distractedly. It was his last chance to
tell Sirius to be careful; he turned, looked into his godfather’s face and

523
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
opened his mouth to speak, but before he could do so Sirius was giv-
ing him a brief, one-armed hug. He said gruffly, “Look after yourself,
Harry,” and next moment Harry found himself being shunted out
into the icy winter air, with Tonks (today heavily disguised as a tall,
tweedy woman with iron-gray hair) chivvying him down the steps.
The door of number twelve slammed shut behind them. They fol-
lowed Lupin down the front steps. As he reached the pavement, Harry
looked around. Number twelve was shrinking rapidly as those on ei-
ther side of it stretched sideways, squeezing it out of sight; one blink
later, it had gone.
“Come on, the quicker we get on the bus the better,” said Tonks,
and Harry thought there was nervousness in the glance she threw
around the square. Lupin flung out his right arm.
BANG.
A violently purple, triple-decker bus had appeared out of thin air in
front of them, narrowly avoiding the nearest lamppost, which jumped
backward out of its way.
A thin, pimply, jug-eared youth in a purple uniform leapt down
onto the pavement and said, “Welcome to the —”
“Yes, yes, we know, thank you,” said Tonks swiftly. “On, on, get
on —
And she shoved Harry forward toward the steps, past the conduc-
tor, who goggled at Harry as he passed.
“ ’Ere — it’s ’Arry — !”
“If you shout his name I will curse you into oblivion,” muttered
Tonks menacingly, now shunting Ginny and Hermione forward.
“I’ve always wanted to go on this thing,” said Ron happily, joining
Harry on board and looking around.
It had been evening the last time Harry had traveled by Knight Bus
and its three decks had been full of brass bedsteads. Now, in the early
morning, it was crammed with an assortment of mismatched chairs

524
OCCLUMENCY
grouped haphazardly around windows. Some of these appeared to
have fallen over when the bus stopped abruptly in Grimmauld Place;
a few witches and wizards were still getting to their feet, grumbling,
and somebody’s shopping bag had slid the length of the bus; an un-
pleasant mixture of frog spawn, cockroaches, and custard creams was
scattered all over the floor.
“Looks like we’ll have to split up,” said Tonics briskly, looking
around for empty chairs. “Fred, George, and Ginny, if you just take
those seats at the back . . . Remus can stay with you. . . .”
She, Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded up to the very top deck,
where there were two chairs at the very front of the bus and two at the
back. Stan Shunpike, the conductor, followed Harry and Ron eagerly
to the back. Heads turned as Harry passed and when he sat down, he
saw all the faces flick back to the front again.
As Harry and Ron handed Stan eleven Sickles each, the bus set off
again, swaying ominously. It rumbled around Grimmauld Square,
weaving on and off the pavement, then, with another tremendous
BANG, they were all flung backward; Ron’s chair toppled right over
and Pigwidgeon, who had been on his lap, burst out of his cage and
flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where he fluttered
down upon Hermione’s shoulder instead. Harry, who had narrowly
avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket, looked out of the window:
they were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway.
“Just outside Birmingham,” said Stan happily, answering Harry’s
unasked question as Ron struggled up from the floor. “You keepin’
well, then, ’Arry? I seen your name in the paper loads over the summer,
but it weren’t never nuffink very nice. . . . I said to Ern, I said, ‘ ’e didn’t
seem like a nutter when we met ’im, just goes to show, dunnit?’ ”
He handed over their tickets and continued to gaze, enthralled, at
Harry; apparently Stan did not care how nutty somebody was if they
were famous enough to be in the paper. The Knight Bus swayed

525
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
alarmingly, overtaking a line of cars on the inside. Looking toward the
front of the bus Harry saw Hermione cover her eyes with her hands,
Pigwidgeon still swaying happily on her shoulder.
BANG.
Chairs slid backward again as the Knight Bus jumped from the
Birmingham motorway to a quiet country lane full of hairpin bends.
Hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of their way as
they mounted the verges. From here they moved to a main street in
the middle of a busy town, then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hills,
then to a windswept road between high-rise flats, each time with a
loud BANG.
“I’ve changed my mind,” muttered Ron, picking himself up from
the floor for the sixth time, “I never want to ride on here again.”
“Listen, it’s ’Ogwarts stop after this,” said Stan brightly, swaying to-
ward them. “That bossy woman up front ’oo got on with you, she’s
given us a little tip to move you up the queue. We’re just gonna let
Madam Marsh off first, though —” There was more retching from
downstairs, followed by a horrible spattering sound. “She’s not feeling
’er best.
A few minutes later the Knight Bus screeched to a halt outside a
small pub, which squeezed itself out of the way to avoid a collision.
They could hear Stan ushering the unfortunate Madam Marsh out of
the bus and the relieved murmurings of her fellow passengers on the
second deck. The bus moved on again, gathering speed, until —
BANG.
They were rolling through a snowy Hogsmeade. Harry caught a
glimpse of the Hog’s Head down its side street, the severed boar’s head
sign creaking in the wintry wind. Flecks of snow hit the large window
at the front of the bus. At last they rolled to a halt outside the gates to
Hogwarts.
Lupin and Tonks helped them off the bus with their luggage and
then got off to say good-bye. Harry glanced up at the three decks of

526
OCCLUMENCY
the Knight Bus and saw all the passengers staring down at them, noses
flat against the windows.
“You’ll be safe once you’re in the grounds,” said Tonks, casting a
careful eye around at the deserted road. “Have a good term, okay?”
“Look after yourselves,” said Lupin, shaking hands all round and
reaching Harry last. “And listen . . .” He lowered his voice while the
rest of them exchanged last-minute good-byes with Tonks, “Harry, I
know you don’t like Snape, but he is a superb Occlumens and we
all — Sirius included — want you to learn to protect yourself, so
work hard, all right?”
“Yeah, all right,” said Harry heavily, looking up into Lupin’s pre-
maturely lined face. “See you, then . . .”
The six of them struggled up the slippery drive toward the castle
dragging their trunks. Hermione was already talking about knitting a
few elf hats before bedtime. Harry glanced back when they reached
the oak front doors; the Knight Bus had already gone, and he half-
wished, given what was coming the following day, that he was still on
board.
Harry spent most of the next day dreading the evening. His morning
Potions lesson did nothing to dispel his trepidation, as Snape was as
unpleasant as ever, and Harry’s mood was further lowered by the fact
that members of the D.A. were continually approaching him in the
corridors between classes, asking hopefully whether there would be a
meeting that night.
“I’ll let you know when the next one is,” Harry said over and over
again, “but I can’t do it tonight, I’ve got to go to — er — Remedial
Potions. . . .”
“You take Remedial Potions?” asked Zacharias Smith superciliously,
having cornered Harry in the entrance hall after lunch. “Good Lord,
you must be terrible, Snape doesn’t usually give extra lessons, does
he?”

527
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
As Smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant fashion, Ron
glared after him.
“Shall I jinx him? I can still get him from here,” he said, raising his
wand and taking aim between Smith’s shoulder blades.
“Forget it,” said Harry dismally. “It’s what everyone’s going to
think, isn’t it? That I’m really stup —”
“Hi, Harry,” said a voice behind him. He turned around and found
Cho standing there.
“Oh,” said Harry as his stomach leapt uncomfortably. “Hi.”
“We’ll be in the library, Harry,” said Hermione firmly, and she
seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off toward the marble
staircase.
“Had a good Christmas?” asked Cho.
“Yeah, not bad,” said Harry.
“Mine was pretty quiet,” said Cho. For some reason, she was look-
ing rather embarrassed. “Erm . . . there’s another Hogsmeade trip
next month, did you see the notice?”
“What? Oh no, I haven’t checked the notice board since I got
back. . . .”
“Yes, it’s on Valentine’s Day. . . .”
“Right,” said Harry, wondering why she was telling him this.
“Well, I suppose you want to — ?”
“Only if you do,” she said eagerly.
Harry stared. He had been about to say “I suppose you want to
know when the next D.A. meeting is?” but her response did not seem
to fit.
“I — er —” he said.
“Oh, it’s okay if you don’t,” she said, looking mortified. “Don’t
worry. I-I’ll see you around.”
She walked away. Harry stood staring after her, his brain working
frantically. Then something clunked into place.

528
OCCLUMENCY
“Cho! Hey — CHO!”
He ran after her, catching her halfway up the marble staircase.
“Er — d’you want to come into Hogsmeade with me on Valen-
tine’s Day?”
“Oooh, yes!” she said, blushing crimson and beaming at him.
“Right . . . well . . . that’s settled then,” said Harry, and feeling that
the day was not going to be a complete loss after all, he headed off to
the library to pick up Ron and Hermione before their afternoon
lessons, walking in a rather bouncy way himself.
By six o’clock that evening, however, even the glow of having suc-
cessfully asked out Cho Chang was insufficient to lighten the omi-
nous feelings that intensified with every step Harry took toward
Snape’s office.
He paused outside the door when he reached it, wishing he were al-
most anywhere else, then, taking a deep breath, knocked, and entered.
It was a shadowy room lined with shelves bearing hundreds of glass
jars in which floated slimy bits of animals and plants, suspended in
variously colored potions. In a corner stood the cupboard full of in-
gredients that Snape had once accused Harry — not without
reason — of robbing. Harry’s attention was drawn toward the desk,
however, where a shallow stone basin engraved with runes and sym-
bols lay in a pool of candlelight. Harry recognized it at once — Dum-
bledore’s Pensieve. Wondering what on earth it was doing here, he
jumped when Snape’s cold voice came out of the corner.
“Shut the door behind you, Potter.”
Harry did as he was told with the horrible feeling that he was im-
prisoning himself as he did so. When he turned back to face the room
Snape had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair
opposite his desk. Harry sat down and so did Snape, his cold black
eyes fixed unblinkingly upon Harry, dislike etched in every line of his
face.

529
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
“Well, Potter, you know why you are here,” he said. “The head-
master has asked me to teach you Occlumency. I can only hope that
you prove more adept at it than Potions.”
“Right,” said Harry tersely.
“This may not be an ordinary class, Potter,” said Snape, his eyes
narrowed malevolently, “but I am still your teacher and you will there-
fore call me ‘sir’ or ‘Professor’ at all times.”
“Yes . . . sir,” said Harry.
“Now, Occlumency. As I told you back in your dear godfather’s
kitchen, this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion
and influence.”
“And why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it, sir?” said
Harry, looking directly into Snape’s dark, cold eyes and wondering
whether he would answer.
Snape looked back at him for a moment and then said contemptu-
ously, “Surely even you could have worked that out by now, Potter?
The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency —”
“What’s that? Sir?”
“It is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another per-
son’s mind —”
“He can read minds?” said Harry quickly, his worst fears confirmed.
“You have no subtlety, Potter,” said Snape, his dark eyes glittering.
“You do not understand fine distinctions. It is one of the shortcom-
ings that makes you such a lamentable potion-maker.”
Snape paused for a moment, apparently to savor the pleasure of
insulting Harry, before continuing, “Only Muggles talk of ‘mind
reading.’ The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined
at leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be
perused by any invader. The mind is a complex and many-layered
thing, Potter . . . or at least, most minds are. . . .” He smirked. “It is
true, however, that those who have mastered Legilimency are able, un-

530
OCCLUMENCY
der certain conditions, to delve into the minds of their victims and to
interpret their findings correctly. The Dark Lord, for instance, almost
always knows when somebody is lying to him. Only those skilled at
Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that
contradict the lie, and so utter falsehoods in his presence without
detection.”
Whatever Snape said, Legilimency sounded like mind reading to
Harry and he did not like the sound of it at all.
“So he could know what we’re thinking right now? Sir?”
“The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and
grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms
to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within
them,” said Snape. “Time and space matter in magic, Potter. Eye con-
tact is often essential to Legilimency.”
“Well then, why do I have to learn Occlumency?”
Snape eyed Harry, tracing his mouth with one long, thin finger as
he did so.
“The usual rules do not seem to apply with you, Potter. The curse
that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection
between you and the Dark Lord. The evidence suggests that at times,
when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable — when you are
asleep, for instance — you are sharing the Dark Lord’s thoughts and
emotions. The headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue.
He wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark
Lord.”
Harry’s heart was pumping fast again. None of this added up.
“But why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it?” he asked
abruptly. “I don’t like it much, but it’s been useful, hasn’t it? I mean
. . . I saw that snake attack Mr. Weasley and if I hadn’t, Professor
Dumbledore wouldn’t have been able to save him, would he? Sir?”
Snape stared at Harry for a few moments, still tracing his mouth

531
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
with his finger. When he spoke again, it was slowly and deliberately, as
though he weighed every word.
“It appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the connection
between you and himself until very recently. Up till now it seems that
you have been experiencing his emotions and sharing his thoughts
without his being any the wiser. However, the vision you had shortly
before Christmas —”
“The one with the snake and Mr. Weasley?”
“Do not interrupt me, Potter,” said Snape in a dangerous voice. “As
I was saying . . . the vision you had shortly before Christmas repre-
sented such a powerful incursion upon the Dark Lord’s thoughts —”
“I saw inside the snake’s head, not his!”
“I thought I just told you not to interrupt me, Potter?”
But Harry did not care if Snape was angry; at last he seemed to be
getting to the bottom of this business. He had moved forward in his
chair so that, without realizing it, he was perched on the very edge,
tense as though poised for flight.
“How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s Voldemort’s
thoughts I’m sharing?”
“Do not say the Dark Lord’s name!” spat Snape.
There was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the
Pensieve.
“Professor Dumbledore says his name,” said Harry quietly.
“Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,” Snape muttered.
“While he may feel secure enough to use the name . . . the rest of
us . . .” He rubbed his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the
spot where Harry knew the Dark Mark was burned into his skin.
“I just wanted to know,” Harry began again, forcing his voice back
to politeness, “why —”
“You seem to have visited the snake’s mind because that was where
the Dark Lord was at that particular moment,” snarled Snape. “He

532
OCCLUMENCY
was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were in-
side it too. . . .”
“And Vol — he — realized I was there?”
“It seems so,” said Snape coolly.
“How do you know?” said Harry urgently. “Is this just Professor
Dumbledore guessing, or — ?”
“I told you,” said Snape, rigid in his chair, his eyes slits, “to call me
‘sir.’ ”
“Yes, sir,” said Harry impatiently, “but how do you know — ?”
“It is enough that we know,” said Snape repressively. “The impor-
tant point is that the Dark Lord is now aware that you are gaining
access to his thoughts and feelings. He has also deduced that the
process is likely to work in reverse; that is to say, he has realized that
he might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return —”
“And he might try and make me do things?” asked Harry. “Sir?” he
added hurriedly.
“He might,” said Snape, sounding cold and unconcerned. “Which
brings us back to Occlumency.”
Snape pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of his robes and
Harry tensed in his chair, but Snape merely raised the wand to his
temple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his hair. When he
withdrew it, some silvery substance came away, stretching from tem-
ple to wand like a thick gossamer strand, which broke as he pulled the
wand away from it and fell gracefully into the Pensieve, where it
swirled silvery white, neither gas nor liquid. Twice more Snape
raised the wand to his temple and deposited the silvery substance
into the stone basin, then, without offering any explanation of his
behavior, he picked up the Pensieve carefully, removed it to a shelf
out of their way and returned to face Harry with his wand held at
the ready.
“Stand up and take out your wand, Potter.”

533
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
Harry got to his feet feeling nervous. They faced each other with
the desk between them.
“You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me, or defend your-
self in any other way you can think of,” said Snape.
“And what are you going to do?” Harry asked, eyeing Snape’s wand
apprehensively.
“I am about to attempt to break into your mind,” said Snape softly.
“We are going to see how well you resist. I have been told that you
have already shown aptitude at resisting the Imperius Curse. . . . You
will find that similar powers are needed for this. . . . Brace yourself,
now. . . . Legilimens!”
Snape had struck before Harry was ready, before Harry had even
begun to summon any force of resistance: the office swam in front of
his eyes and vanished, image after image was racing through his mind
like a flickering film so vivid it blinded him to his surroundings. . . .
He was five, watching Dudley riding a new red bicycle, and his
heart was bursting with jealousy. . . . He was nine, and Ripper the
bulldog was chasing him up a tree and the Dursleys were laughing be-
low on the lawn. . . . He was sitting under the Sorting Hat, and it was
telling him he would do well in Slytherin. . . . Hermione was lying in
the hospital wing, her face covered with thick black hair. . . . A hun-
dred dementors were closing in on him beside the dark lake. . . . Cho
Chang was drawing nearer to him under the mistletoe. . . .
No, said a voice in Harry’s head, as the memory of Cho drew nearer,
you’re not watching that, you’re not watching it, it’s private —
He felt a sharp pain in his knee. Snape’s office had come back into
view and he realized that he had fallen to the floor; one of his knees
had collided painfully with the leg of Snape’s desk. He looked up at
Snape, who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist. There
was an angry weal there, like a scorch mark.
“Did you mean to produce a Stinging Hex?” asked Snape coolly.
“No,” said Harry bitterly, getting up from the floor.

534
OCCLUMENCY
“I thought not,” said Snape contemptuously. “You let me get in too
far. You lost control.”
“Did you see everything I saw?” Harry asked, unsure whether he
wanted to hear the answer.
“Flashes of it,” said Snape, his lip curling. “To whom did the dog
belong?”
“My Aunt Marge,” Harry muttered, hating Snape.
“Well, for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have
been,” said Snape, raising his wand once more. “You managed to stop
me eventually, though you wasted time and energy shouting. You
must remain focused. Repel me with your brain and you will not need
to resort to your wand.”
“I’m trying,” said Harry angrily, “but you’re not telling me how!”
“Manners, Potter,” said Snape dangerously. “Now, I want you to
close your eyes.”
Harry threw him a filthy look before doing as he was told. He did
not like the idea of standing there with his eyes shut while Snape faced
him, carrying a wand.
“Clear your mind, Potter,” said Snape’s cold voice. “Let go of all
emotion. . . .”
But Harry’s anger at Snape continued to pound through his veins
like venom. Let go of his anger? He could as easily detach his legs. . . .
“You’re not doing it, Potter. . . . You will need more discipline than
this. . . . Focus, now. . . .”
Harry tried to empty his mind, tried not to think, or remember, or
feel. . . .
“Let’s go again . . . on the count of three . . . one — two —
three — Legilimens!”
A great black dragon was rearing in front of him. . . . His father
and mother were waving at him out of an enchanted mirror. . . .
Cedric Diggory was lying on the ground with blank eyes staring at
him. . . .


“NOOOOOOO!”
He was on his knees again, his face buried in his hands, his brain
aching as though someone had been trying to pull it from his skull.
“Get up!” said Snape sharply. “Get up! You are not trying, you are
making no effort, you are allowing me access to memories you fear,
handing me weapons!”
Harry stood up again, his heart thumping wildly as though he had
really just seen Cedric dead in the graveyard. Snape looked paler than
usual, and angrier, though not nearly as angry as Harry was.
“I — am — making — an — effort,” he said through clenched
teeth.
“I told you to empty yourself of emotion!”
“Yeah? Well, I’m finding that hard at the moment,” Harry snarled.
“Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord!” said
Snape savagely. “Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves,
who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and
allow themselves to be provoked this easily — weak people, in other
words — they stand no chance against his powers! He will penetrate
your mind with absurd ease, Potter!”
“I am not weak,” said Harry in a low voice, fury now pumping
through him so that he thought he might attack Snape in a moment.
“Then prove it! Master yourself!” spat Snape. “Control your anger,
discipline your mind! We shall try again! Get ready, now! Legilimens!”
He was watching Uncle Vernon hammering the letter box shut. . . .
A hundred dementors were drifting across the lake in the grounds to-
ward him. . . . He was running along a windowless passage with Mr.
Weasley. . . . They were drawing nearer to the plain black door at the
end of the corridor. . . . Harry expected to go through it . . . but Mr.
Weasley led him off to the left, down a flight of stone steps. . . .
“I KNOW! I KNOW!”
He was on all fours again on Snape’s office floor, his scar was prick-

536
OCCLUMENCY
ling unpleasantly, but the voice that had just issued from his mouth
was triumphant. He pushed himself up again to find Snape staring at
him, his wand raised. It looked as though, this time, Snape had lifted
the spell before Harry had even tried to fight back.
“What happened then, Potter?” he asked, eyeing Harry intently.
“I saw — I remembered,” Harry panted. “I’ve just realized . . .”
“Realized what?” asked Snape sharply.
Harry did not answer at once; he was still savoring the moment of
blinding realization as he rubbed his forehead. . . .
He had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a
locked door for months, without once realizing that it was a real place.
Now, seeing the memory again, he knew that all along he had been
dreaming about the corridor down which he had run with Mr.
Weasley on the twelfth of August as they hurried to the courtrooms in
the Ministry. It was the corridor leading to the Department of Mys-
teries, and Mr. Weasley had been there the night that he had been at-
tacked by Voldemort’s snake. . . .
He looked up at Snape.
“What’s in the Department of Mysteries?”
“What did you say?” Snape asked quietly and Harry saw, with deep
satisfaction, that Snape was unnerved.
“I said, what’s in the Department of Mysteries, sir?” Harry said.
“And why,” said Snape slowly, “would you ask such a thing?”
“Because,” said Harry, watching Snape closely for a reaction, “that
corridor I’ve just seen — I’ve been dreaming about it for months —
I’ve just recognized it — it leads to the Department of Mysteries . . .
and I think Voldemort wants something from —”
“I have told you not to say the Dark Lord’s name!”
They glared at each other. Harry’s scar seared again, but he did not
care. Snape looked agitated. When he spoke again he sounded as
though he was trying to appear cool and unconcerned.

537
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
“There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter,
few of which you would understand and none of which concern you,
do I make myself plain?”
“Yes,” Harry said, still rubbing his prickling scar, which was be-
coming more painful.
“I want you back here same time on Wednesday, and we will con-
tinue work then.”
“Fine,” said Harry. He was desperate to get out of Snape’s office
and find Ron and Hermione.
“You are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before
sleep — empty it, make it blank and calm, you understand?”
“Yes,” said Harry, who was barely listening.
“And be warned, Potter . . . I shall know if you have not prac-
ticed . . .”
“Right,” Harry mumbled. He picked up his schoolbag, swung it
over his shoulder, and hurried toward the office door. As he opened it
he glanced back at Snape, who had his back to Harry and was scoop-
ing his own thoughts out of the Pensieve with the tip of his wand and
replacing them carefully inside his own head. Harry left without an-
other word, closing the door carefully behind him, his scar still throb-
bing painfully.
Harry found Ron and Hermione in the library, where they were
working on Umbridge’s most recent ream of homework. Other stu-
dents, nearly all of them fifth years, sat at lamp-lit tables nearby, noses
close to books, quills scratching feverishly, while the sky outside the
mullioned windows grew steadily blacker. The only other sound was
the slight squeaking of one of Madam Pince’s shoes as the librarian
prowled the aisles menacingly, breathing down the necks of those
touching her precious books.
Harry felt shivery; his scar was still aching, he felt almost feverish.
When he sat down opposite Ron and Hermione he caught sight of

538
OCCLUMENCY
himself in the window opposite. He was very white, and his scar
seemed to be showing up more clearly than usual.
“How did it go?” Hermione whispered, and then, looking con-
cerned, “Are you all right, Harry?”
“Yeah . . . fine . . . I dunno,” said Harry impatiently, wincing as
pain shot through his scar again. “Listen . . . I’ve just realized some-
thing. . . .”
And he told them what he had just seen and deduced.
“So . . . so, are you saying . . .” whispered Ron, as Madam Pince
swept past, squeaking slightly, “that the weapon — the thing You-
Know-Who’s after — is in the Ministry of Magic?”
“In the Department of Mysteries, it’s got to be,” Harry whispered.
“I saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for
my hearing and it’s definitely the same one he was guarding when the
snake bit him.”
Hermione let out a long, slow sigh. “Of course,” she breathed.
“Of course what?” said Ron rather impatiently.
“Ron, think about it. . . . Sturgis Podmore was trying to get
through a door at the Ministry of Magic. . . . It must have been that
one, it’s too much of a coincidence!”
“How come Sturgis was trying to break in when he’s on our side?”
said Ron.
“Well, I don’t know,” Hermione admitted. “That is a bit odd. . . .”
“So what’s in the Department of Mysteries?” Harry asked Ron.
“Has your dad ever mentioned anything about it?”
“I know they call the people who work in there ‘Unspeakables,’ ”
said Ron, frowning. “Because no one really seems to know what they
do in there. . . . Weird place to have a weapon . . .”
“It’s not weird at all, it makes perfect sense,” said Hermione. “It will
be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing, I ex-
pect. . . . Harry, are you sure you’re all right?”

539
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
For Harry had just run both his hands hard over his forehead as
though trying to iron it.
“Yeah . . . fine . . .” he said, lowering his hands, which were trem-
bling. “I just feel a bit . . . I don’t like Occlumency much. . . .”
“I expect anyone would feel shaky if they’d had their mind attacked
over and over again,” said Hermione sympathetically. “Look, let’s get
back to the common room, we’ll be a bit more comfortable there. . . .”
But the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter
and excitement; Fred and George were demonstrating their latest bit
of joke shop merchandise.
“Headless Hats!” shouted George, as Fred waved a pointed hat dec-
orated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students. “Two
Galleons each — watch Fred, now!”
Fred swept the hat onto his head, beaming. For a second he merely
looked rather stupid, then both hat and head vanished.
Several girls screamed, but everyone else was roaring with laughter.
“And off again!” shouted George, and Fred’s hand groped for a mo-
ment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder; then his head
reappeared as he swept the pink-feathered hat from it again.
“How do those hats work, then?” said Hermione, distracted from
her homework and watching Fred and George. “I mean, obviously it’s
some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it’s rather clever to have extended
the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object.
. . . I’d imagine the charm wouldn’t have a very long life though. . . .”
Harry did not answer; he was still feeling ill.
“I’m going to have to do this tomorrow,” he muttered, pushing the
books he had just taken out of his bag back inside it.
“Well, write it in your homework planner then!” said Hermione
encouragingly. “So you don’t forget!”
Harry and Ron exchanged looks as he reached into his bag, with-
drew the planner and opened it tentatively.

540
OCCLUMENCY
“Don’t leave it till later, you big second-rater!” chided the book as
Harry scribbled down Umbridge’s homework. Hermione beamed at it.
“I think I’ll go to bed,” said Harry, stuffing the homework planner
back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the
first opportunity he got.
He walked across the common room, dodging George, who tried
to put a Headless Hat on him, and reached the peace and cool of the
stone staircase to the boys’ dormitories. He was feeling sick again, just
as he had the night he had had the vision of the snake, but thought
that if he could just lie down for a while he would be all right.
He opened the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it
when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must
have sliced into the top of his head. He did not know where he was,
whether he was standing or lying down, he did not even know his own
name. . . .
Maniacal laughter was ringing in his ears. . . . He was happier than
he had been in a very long time. . . . Jubilant, ecstatic, triumphant . . .
A wonderful, wonderful thing had happened. . . .
“Harry? HARRY!”
Someone had hit him around the face. The insane laughter was
punctuated with a cry of pain. The happiness was draining out of
him, but the laughter continued. . . .
He opened his eyes and as he did so, he became aware that the wild
laughter was coming out of his own mouth. The moment he realized
this, it died away; Harry lay panting on the floor, staring up at the
ceiling, the scar on his forehead throbbing horribly. Ron was bending
over him, looking very worried.
“What happened?” he said.
“I . . . dunno . . .” Harry gasped, sitting up again. “He’s really
happy . . . really happy . . .”
“You-Know-Who is?”

541
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
“Something good’s happened,” mumbled Harry. He was shaking as
badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack Mr. Weasley and felt
very sick. “Something he’s been hoping for.”
The words came, just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing
room, as though a stranger was speaking them through Harry’s
mouth, yet he knew they were true. He took deep breaths, willing
himself not to vomit all over Ron. He was very glad that Dean and
Seamus were not here to watch this time.
“Hermione told me to come and check on you,” said Ron in a low
voice, helping Harry to his feet. “She says your defenses will be low at
the moment, after Snape’s been fiddling around with your mind. . . .
Still, I suppose it’ll help in the long run, won’t it?”
He looked doubtfully at Harry as he helped him toward bed. Harry
nodded without any conviction and slumped back on his pillows,
aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening,
his scar still prickling painfully. He could not help feeling that his first
foray into Occlumency had weakened his mind’s resistance rather
than strengthening it, and he wondered, with a feeling of great trepi-
dation, what had happened to make Lord Voldemort the happiest he
had been in fourteen years.

THE BEETLE AT BAY
H
arry’s question was answered the very next morning. When
Hermione’s Daily Prophet arrived she smoothed it out, gazed
for a moment at the front page, and then gave a yelp that caused every-
one in the vicinity to stare at her.
“What?” said Harry and Ron together.
For an answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of
them and pointed at ten black-and-white photographs that filled the
whole of the front page, nine showing wizards’ faces and the tenth, a
witch’s. Some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering;
others were tapping their fingers on the frame of their pictures, look-
ing insolent. Each picture was captioned with a name and the crime
for which the person had been sent to Azkaban.
Antonin Dolohov, read the legend beneath a wizard with a long,
pale, twisted face who was sneering up at Harry, convicted of the bru-
tal murders of Gideon and Fabian Prewett.
Augustus Rookwood, said the caption beneath a pockmarked man
with greasy hair who was leaning against the edge of his picture,

543
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
looking bored, convicted of leaking Ministry of Magic Secrets to He-
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
But Harry’s eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch. Her face
had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page. She had long,
dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture, though he
had seen it sleek, thick, and shining. She glared up at him through
heavily lidded eyes, an arrogant, disdainful smile playing around her
thin mouth. Like Sirius, she retained vestiges of great good looks, but
something — perhaps Azkaban — had taken most of her beauty.
Bellatrix Lestrange, convicted of the torture and permanent incapaci-
tation of Frank and Alice Longbottom.
Hermione nudged Harry and pointed at the headline over the pic-
tures, which Harry, concentrating on Bellatrix, had not yet read.
MASS BREAKOUT FROM AZKABAN
MINISTRY FEARS BLACK IS “RALLYING POINT”
FOR OLD DEATH EATERS
“Black?” said Harry loudly. “Not — ?”
“Shhh!” whispered Hermione desperately. “Not so loud — just
read it!”
The Ministry of Magic announced late last night that
there has been a mass breakout from Azkaban.
Speaking to reporters in his private office, Cor-
nelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, confirmed that ten
high-security prisoners escaped in the early hours of
yesterday evening, and that he has already informed
the Muggle Prime Minister of the dangerous nature
of these individuals.
“We find ourselves, most unfortunately, in the
same position we were two and a half years ago when

544
THE BEETLE AT BAY
the murderer Sirius Black escaped,” said Fudge last
night. “Nor do we think the two breakouts are unre-
lated. An escape of this magnitude suggests outside
help, and we must remember that Black, as the first
person ever to break out of Azkaban, would be ideally
placed to help others follow in his footsteps. We think
it likely that these individuals, who include Black’s
cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, have rallied around Black
as their leader. We are, however, doing all we can to
round up the criminals and beg the magical commu-
nity to remain alert and cautious. On no account
should any of these individuals be approached.”
“There you are, Harry,” said Ron, looking awestruck. “That’s why
he was happy last night. . . .”
“I don’t believe this,” snarled Harry, “Fudge is blaming the break-
out on Sirius?”
“What other options does he have?” said Hermione bitterly. “He
can hardly say, ‘Sorry everyone, Dumbledore warned me this might
happen, the Azkaban guards have joined Lord Voldemort’ — stop
whimpering, Ron — ‘and now Voldemort’s worst supporters have bro-
ken out too.’ I mean, he’s spent a good six months telling everyone
you and Dumbledore are liars, hasn’t he?”
Hermione ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report
inside while Harry looked around the Great Hall. He could not un-
derstand why his fellow students were not looking scared or at least
discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page, but very few of
them took the newspaper every day like Hermione. There they all
were, talking about homework and Quidditch and who knew what
other rubbish, and outside these walls ten more Death Eaters had
swollen Voldemort’s ranks. . . .
He glanced up at the staff table. It was a different story here:

545
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall were deep in conversation,
both looking extremely grave. Professor Sprout had the Prophet
propped against a bottle of ketchup and was reading the front page
with such concentration that she was not noticing the gentle drip of
egg yolk falling into her lap from her stationary spoon. Meanwhile, at
the far end of the table, Professor Umbridge was tucking into a bowl
of porridge. For once her pouchy toad’s eyes were not sweeping the
Great Hall looking for misbehaving students. She scowled as she
gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent
glance up the table to where Dumbledore and McGonagall were talk-
ing so intently.
“Oh my —” said Hermione wonderingly, still staring at the
newspaper.
“What now?” said Harry quickly; he was feeling jumpy.
“It’s . . . horrible,” said Hermione, looking shaken. She folded back
page ten of the newspaper and handed it back to Harry and Ron.
TRAGIC DEMISE OF
MINISTRY OF MAGIC WORKER
St. Mungo’s Hospital promised a full inquiry last
night after Ministry of Magic worker Broderick
Bode, 49, was discovered dead in his bed, strangled by
a potted-plant. Healers called to the scene were unable
to revive Mr. Bode, who had been injured in a
workplace accident some weeks prior to his death.
Healer Miriam Strout, who was in charge of Mr.
Bode’s ward at the time of the incident, has been sus-
pended on full pay and was unavailable for comment
yesterday, but a spokeswizard for the hospital said in
a statement, “St. Mungo’s deeply regrets the death of
Mr. Bode, whose health was improving steadily prior
to this tragic accident.

546
THE BEETLE AT BAY
“We have strict guidelines on the decorations per-
mitted on our wards but it appears that Healer Strout,
busy over the Christmas period, overlooked the
dangers of the plant on Mr. Bode’s bedside table. As
his speech and mobility improved, Healer Strout en-
couraged Mr. Bode to look after the plant himself,
unaware that it was not an innocent Flitterbloom, but
a cutting of Devil’s Snare, which, when touched by
the convalescent Mr. Bode, throttled him instantly.
“St. Mungo’s is as yet unable to account for the
presence of the plant on the ward and asks any witch
or wizard with information to come forward.”
“Bode . . .” said Ron. “Bode. It rings a bell. . . .”
“We saw him,” Hermione whispered. “In St. Mungo’s, remember?
He was in the bed opposite Lockhart’s, just lying there, staring at the
ceiling. And we saw the Devil’s Snare arrive. She — the Healer —
said it was a Christmas present. . . .”
Harry looked back at the story. A feeling of horror was rising like
bile in his throat.
“How come we didn’t recognize Devil’s Snare . . . ? We’ve seen it
before . . . we could’ve stopped this from happening . . .”
“Who expects Devil’s Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a
potted plant?” said Ron sharply. “It’s not our fault, whoever sent it to
the bloke is to blame! They must be a real prat, why didn’t they check
what they were buying?”
“Oh come on, Ron!” said Hermione shakily, “I don’t think anyone
could put Devil’s Snare in a pot and not realize it tries to kill whoever
touches it? This — this was murder. . . . A clever murder, as well. . . .
If the plant was sent anonymously, how’s anyone ever going to find
out who did it?”
Harry was not thinking about Devil’s Snare. He was remembering

547
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
taking the lift down to the ninth level of the Ministry on the day of
his hearing, and the sallow-faced man who had got in on the Atrium
level.
“I met Bode,” he said slowly. “I saw him at the Ministry with your
dad . . .”
Ron’s mouth fell open.
“I’ve heard Dad talk about him at home! He was an Unspeak-
able — he worked in the Department of Mysteries!”
They looked at one another for a moment, then Hermione pulled
the newspaper back toward her, closed it, glared for a moment at the
pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters on the front, then leapt to her
feet.
“Where are you going?” said Ron, startled.
“To send a letter,” said Hermione, swinging her bag onto her
shoulder. “It . . . well, I don’t know whether . . . but it’s worth trying
. . . and I’m the only one who can . . .”
“I hate it when she does that,” grumbled Ron as he and Harry got
up from the table and made their own, slower way out of the Great
Hall. “Would it kill her to tell us what she’s up to for once? It’d take
her about ten more seconds — hey, Hagrid!”
Hagrid was standing beside the doors into the entrance hall, wait-
ing for a crowd of Ravenclaws to pass. He was still as heavily bruised
as he had been on the day he had come back from his mission to the
giants and there was a new cut right across the bridge of his nose.
“All righ’, you two?” he said, trying to muster a smile but managing
only a kind of pained grimace.
“Are you okay, Hagrid?” asked Harry, following him as he lum-
bered after the Ravenclaws.
“Fine, fine,” said Hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness; he
waved a hand and narrowly missed concussing a frightened-looking
Professor Vector, who was passing. “Jus’ busy, yeh know, usual stuff —

548
THE BEETLE AT BAY
lessons ter prepare — couple o’ salamanders got scale rot — an’ I’m
on probation,” he mumbled.
“You’re on probation?” said Ron very loudly, so that many students
passing looked around curiously. “Sorry — I mean — you’re on pro-
bation?” he whispered.
“Yeah,” said Hagrid. “ ’S’no more’n I expected, ter tell yeh the
truth. Yeh migh’ not’ve picked up on it, bu’ that inspection didn’ go
too well, yeh know . . . anyway,” he sighed deeply. “Bes’ go an rub a
bit more chili powder on them salamanders or their tails’ll be hangin’
off ’em next. See yeh, Harry . . . Ron . . .”
He trudged away, out the front doors and down the stone steps into
the damp grounds. Harry watched him go, wondering how much
more bad news he could stand.
The fact that Hagrid was now on probation became common knowl-
edge within the school over the next few days, but to Harry’s indigna-
tion, hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it; indeed, some
people, Draco Malfoy prominent among them, seemed positively
gleeful. As for the freakish death of an obscure Department of Mys-
teries employee in St. Mungo’s, Harry, Ron, and Hermione seemed to
be the only people who knew or cared. There was only one topic of
conversation in the corridors now: the ten escaped Death Eaters,
whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few
people who read the newspapers. Rumors were flying that some of the
convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade, that they were supposed to
be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to
break into Hogwarts, just as Sirius Black had done.
Those who came from Wizarding families had grown up hearing
the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear
as Voldemort’s; the crimes they had committed during the days
of Voldemort’s reign of terror were legendary. There were relatives of

549
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found them-
selves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as
they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, who had an uncle, aunt, and
cousins who had all died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably
during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be
Harry.
“And I don’t know how you stand it, it’s horrible,” she said bluntly,
dumping far too much dragon manure on her tray of Screechsnap
seedlings, causing them to wriggle and squeak in discomfort.
It was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering
and pointing in the corridors these days, yet he thought he detected a
slight difference in the tone of the whisperers’ voices. They sounded
curious rather than hostile now, and once or twice he was sure he over-
heard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were
not satisfied with the Prophet’s version of how and why ten Death
Eaters had managed to break out of Azkaban fortress. In their confu-
sion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only
other explanation available to them, the one that Harry and Dumble-
dore had been expounding since the previous year.
It was not only the students’ mood that had changed. It was now
quite common to come across two or three teachers conversing in low,
urgent whispers in the corridors, breaking off their conversations the
moment they saw students approaching.
“They obviously can’t talk freely in the staffroom anymore,” said
Hermione in a low voice, as she, Harry, and Ron passed Professors
McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout huddled together outside the
Charms classroom one day. “Not with Umbridge there.”
“Reckon they know anything new?” said Ron, gazing back over his
shoulder at the three teachers.
“If they do, we’re not going to hear about it, are we?” said Harry an-
grily. “Not after Decree . . . What number are we on now?”

550
THE BEETLE AT BAY
For new signs had appeared on the house notice boards the morn-
ing after news of the Azkaban breakout:
— by order of —
The High Inquisitor of Hogwarts
Teachers are hereby banned from giving students any infor-
mation that is not strictly related to the subjects they are
paid to teach.
The above is in accordance with
Educational Decree Number Twenty-six.
Signed:
high inquisitor
This latest decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes
among the students. Lee Jordan had pointed out to Umbridge that by
the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell Fred and George
off for playing Exploding Snap in the back of the class.
“Exploding Snap’s got nothing to do with Defense Against the
Dark Arts, Professor! That’s not information relating to your subject!”
When Harry next saw Lee, the back of his hand was bleeding rather
badly. Harry recommended essence of murtlap.
Harry had thought that the breakout from Azkaban might have
humbled Umbridge a little, that she might have been abashed at the
catastrophe that had occurred right under her beloved Fudge’s nose. It
seemed, however, to have only intensified her furious desire to bring
every aspect of life at Hogwarts under her personal control. She

551
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
seemed determined at the very least to achieve a sacking before long,
and the only question was whether it would be Professor Trelawney or
Hagrid who went first.
Every single Divination and Care of Magical Creatures lesson was
now conducted in the presence of Umbridge and her clipboard. She
lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room, interrupting
Professor Trelawney’s increasingly hysterical talks with difficult ques-
tions about Ornithomancy and Heptomology, insisting that she pre-
dict students’ answers before they gave them and demanding that she
demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball, the tea leaves, and the rune
stones in turn. Harry thought that Professor Trelawney might soon
crack under the strain; several times he passed her in the corridors (in
itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in her tower
room), muttering wildly to herself, wringing her hands, and shooting
terrified glances over her shoulder, all the time giving off a powerful
smell of cooking sherry. If he had not been so worried about Hagrid,
he would have felt sorry for her — but if one of them was to be ousted
out of a job, there could be only one choice for Harry as to who
should remain.
Unfortunately, Harry could not see that Hagrid was putting up a
better show than Trelawney. Though he seemed to be following Her-
mione’s advice and had shown them nothing more frightening than
a crup, a creature indistinguishable from a Jack Russell terrier except
for its forked tail, since before Christmas, he also seemed to have lost
his nerve. He was oddly distracted and jumpy in lessons, losing the
thread of what he was saying while talking to the class, answering
questions wrongly and glancing anxiously at Umbridge all the time.
He was also more distant with Harry, Ron, and Hermione than he had
ever been before, expressly forbidding them to visit him after dark.
“If she catches yeh, it’ll be all of our necks on the line,” he told
them flatly, and with no desire to do anything that jeopardized his job
further, they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evenings.

552
THE BEETLE AT BAY
It seemed to Harry that Umbridge was steadily depriving him of
everything that made his life at Hogwarts worth living: visits to Ha-
grid’s house, letters from Sirius, his Firebolt, and Quidditch. He took
his revenge the only way he had: redoubling his efforts for the D.A.
Harry was pleased to see that all of them, even Zacharias Smith,
had been spurred to work harder than ever by the news that ten more
Death Eaters were now on the loose, but in nobody was this improve-
ment more pronounced than in Neville. The news of his parents’ at-
tacker’s escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming
change in him. He had not once mentioned his meeting with Harry,
Ron, and Hermione on the closed ward in St. Mungo’s, and taking
their lead from him, they had kept quiet about it too. Nor had he said
anything on the subject of Bellatrix and her fellow torturers’ escape; in
fact, he barely spoke during D.A. meetings anymore, but worked re-
lentlessly on every new jinx and countercurse Harry taught them, his
plump face screwed up in concentration, apparently indifferent to in-
juries or accidents, working harder than anyone else in the room. He
was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught
them the Shield Charm, a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that
they rebounded upon the attacker, only Hermione mastered the
charm faster than Neville.
In fact Harry would have given a great deal to be making as much
progress at Occlumency as Neville was making during D.A. meetings.
Harry’s sessions with Snape, which had started badly enough, were
not improving; on the contrary, Harry felt he was getting worse with
every lesson.
Before he had started studying Occlumency, his scar had prickled
occasionally, usually during the night, or else following one of those
strange flashes of Voldemort’s thoughts or moods that he experienced
every now and then. Nowadays, however, his scar hardly ever stopped
prickling, and he often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that
were unrelated to what was happening to him at the time, which were

553
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar. He
had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of
aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Voldemort’s mood, and
he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first
Occlumency lesson with Snape. What was more, he was now dream-
ing about walking down the corridor toward the entrance to the
Department of Mysteries almost every night, dreams that always cul-
minated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door.
“Maybe it’s a bit like an illness,” said Hermione, looking concerned
when Harry confided in her and Ron. “A fever or something. It has to
get worse before it gets better.”
“It’s lessons with Snape that are making it worse,” said Harry flatly.
“I’m getting sick of my scar hurting, and I’m getting bored walking
down that corridor every night.” He rubbed his forehead angrily. “I
just wish the door would open, I’m sick of standing staring at it —”
“That’s not funny,” said Hermione sharply. “Dumbledore doesn’t
want you to have dreams about that corridor at all, or he wouldn’t
have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency. You’re just going to have
to work a bit harder in your lessons.”
“I am working!” said Harry, nettled. “You try it sometime, Snape
trying to get inside your head, it’s not a bundle of laughs, you know!”
“Maybe . . .” said Ron slowly.
“Maybe what?” said Hermione rather snappishly.
“Maybe it’s not Harry’s fault he can’t close his mind,” said Ron darkly.
“What do you mean?” said Hermione.
“Well, maybe Snape isn’t really trying to help Harry. . . .”
Harry and Hermione stared at him. Ron looked darkly and mean-
ingfully from one to the other.
“Maybe,” he said again in a lower voice, “he’s actually trying to
open Harry’s mind a bit wider . . . make it easier for You-Know —”
“Shut up, Ron,” said Hermione angrily. “How many times have

554
THE BEETLE AT BAY
you suspected Snape, and when have you ever been right? Dumble-
dore trusts him, he works for the Order, that ought to be enough.”
“He used to be a Death Eater,” said Ron stubbornly. “And we’ve
never seen proof that he really swapped sides. . . .”
“Dumbledore trusts him,” Hermione repeated. “And if we can’t
trust Dumbledore, we can’t trust anyone.”
With so much to worry about and so much to do — startling
amounts of homework that frequently kept the fifth years working
until past midnight, secret D.A. meetings, and regular classes with
Snape — January seemed to be passing alarmingly fast. Before Harry
knew it, February had arrived, bringing with it wetter and warmer
weather and the prospect of the second Hogsmeade visit of the year.
Harry had had very little time to spare on conversations with Cho
since they had agreed to visit the village together, but suddenly found
himself facing a Valentine’s Day spent entirely in her company.
On the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully.
He and Ron arrived at breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post
owls. Hedwig was not there — not that he had expected her — but
Hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown
owl as they sat down.
“And about time! If it hadn’t come today . . .” she said eagerly, tear-
ing open the envelope and pulling out a small piece of parchment.
Her eyes sped from left to right as she read through the message and a
grimly pleased expression spread across her face.
“Listen, Harry,” she said, looking up at him. “This is really impor-
tant. . . . Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks
around midday?”
“Well . . . I dunno,” said Harry dubiously. “Cho might be expect-
ing me to spend the whole day with her. We never said what we were
going to do.”

555
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
“Well, bring her along if you must,” said Hermione urgently. “But
will you come?”
“Well . . . all right, but why?”
“I haven’t got time to tell you now, I’ve got to answer this
quickly —”
And she hurried out of the Great Hall, the letter clutched in one
hand and a piece of uneaten toast in the other.
“Are you coming?” Harry asked Ron, but he shook his head, look-
ing glum.
“I can’t come into Hogsmeade at all, Angelina wants a full day’s
training. Like it’s going to help — we’re the worst team I’ve ever seen.
You should see Sloper and Kirke, they’re pathetic, even worse than I
am.” He heaved a great sigh. “I dunno why Angelina won’t just let me
resign. . . .”
“It’s because you’re good when you’re on form, that’s why,” said
Harry irritably.
He found it very hard to be sympathetic to Ron’s plight when he
himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forth-
coming match against Hufflepuff. Ron seemed to notice Harry’s tone,
because he did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and
there was a slight frostiness in the way they said good-bye to each
other shortly afterward. Ron departed for the Quidditch pitch and
Harry, after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection
in the back of a teaspoon, proceeded alone to the entrance hall to
meet Cho, feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth
they were going to talk about.
She was waiting for him a little to the side of the oak front doors,
looking very pretty with her hair tied back in a long ponytail. Harry’s
feet seemed to be too big for his body as he walked toward her, and he
was suddenly horribly aware of his arms and how stupid they looked
swinging at his sides.

556
THE BEETLE AT BAY
“Hi,” said Cho slightly breathlessly.
“Hi,” said Harry.
They stared at each other for a moment, then Harry said, “Well —
er — shall we go, then?”
“Oh — yes . . .”
They joined the queue of people being signed out by Filch, occa-
sionally catching each other’s eye and grinning shiftily, but not talking
to each other. Harry was relieved when they reached the fresh air, find-
ing it easier to walk along in silence than just stand there looking awk-
ward. It was a fresh, breezy sort of day and as they passed the Quidditch
stadium, Harry glimpsed Ron and Ginny skimming over the stands
and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them. . . .
“You really miss it, don’t you?” said Cho.
He looked around and saw her watching him.
“Yeah,” sighed Harry. “I do.”
“Remember the first time we played against each other, in the third
year?” she asked him.
“Yeah,” said Harry, grinning. “You kept blocking me.”
“And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my
broom if you had to,” said Cho, smiling reminiscently. “I heard he got
taken on by Pride of Portree, is that right?”
“Nah, it was Puddlemere United, I saw him at the World Cup last
year.”
“Oh, I saw you there too, remember? We were on the same camp-
site. It was really good, wasn’t it?”
The subject of the Quidditch World Cup carried them all the way
down the drive and out through the gates. Harry could hardly believe
how easy it was to talk to her, no more difficult, in fact, than talking
to Ron and Hermione, and he was just starting to feel confident and
cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them, including
Pansy Parkinson.

557
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
“Potter and Chang!” screeched Pansy to a chorus of snide giggles.
“Urgh, Chang, I don’t think much of your taste. . . . At least Diggory
was good-looking!”
They sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with
many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho, leaving an embar-
rassed silence in their wake. Harry could think of nothing else to say
about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching her feet.
“So . . . where d’you want to go?” Harry asked as they entered
Hogsmeade. The High Street was full of students ambling up and
down, peering into the shop windows and messing about together on
the pavements.
“Oh . . . I don’t mind,” said Cho, shrugging. “Um . . . shall we just
have a look in the shops or something?”
They wandered toward Dervish and Banges. A large poster had
been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at
it. They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry
found himself staring once more at the ten pictures of the escaped
Death Eaters. The poster (“By Order of the Ministry of Magic”) of-
fered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with infor-
mation relating to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured.
“It’s funny, isn’t it,” said Cho in a low voice, also gazing up at the
pictures of the Death Eaters. “Remember when that Sirius Black es-
caped, and there were dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for
him? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there aren’t de-
mentors anywhere. . . .”
“Yeah,” said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Bellatrix Lestrange’s
face to glance up and down the High Street. “Yeah, it is weird. . . .”
He was not sorry that there were no dementors nearby, but now he
came to think of it, their absence was highly significant. They had not
only let the Death Eaters escape, they were not bothering to look for
them. . . . It looked as though they really were outside Ministry con-
trol now.

558
THE BEETLE AT BAY
The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window
he and Cho passed. It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft’s; cold,
heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry’s face and the back of his neck.
“Um . . . d’you want to get a coffee?” said Cho tentatively, as the
rain began to fall more heavily.
“Yeah, all right,” said Harry, looking around. “Where — ?”
“Oh, there’s a really nice place just up here, haven’t you ever been
to Madam Puddifoot’s?” she said brightly, and she led him up a side
road and into a small tea shop that Harry had never noticed before. It
was a cramped, steamy little place where everything seemed to have
been decorated with frills or bows. Harry was reminded unpleasantly
of Umbridge’s office.
“Cute, isn’t it?” said Cho happily.
“Er . . . yeah,” said Harry untruthfully.
“Look, she’s decorated it for Valentine’s Day!” said Cho, indicating
a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small,
circular tables, occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants.
“Aaah . . .”
They sat down at the last remaining table, which was situated in
the steamy window. Roger Davies, the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain,
was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl. They
were holding hands. The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable, par-
ticularly when, looking around the tea shop, he saw that it was full of
nothing but couples, all of them holding hands. Perhaps Cho would
expect him to hold her hand.
“What can I get you, m’dears?” said Madam Puddifoot, a very stout
woman with a shiny black bun, squeezing between their table and
Roger Davies’s with great difficulty.
“Two coffees, please,” said Cho.
In the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his
girlfriend started kissing over their sugar bowl. Harry wished they
wouldn’t; he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which Cho

559
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
would soon expect him to compete. He felt his face growing hot and
tried staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up he could not
see the street outside. To postpone the moment when he had to look
at Cho he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork
and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering
cherub.
After a few more painful minutes Cho mentioned Umbridge;
Harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy
moments abusing her, but the subject had already been so thoroughly
canvassed during D.A. meetings it did not last very long. Silence fell
again. Harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from
the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say.
“Er . . . listen, d’you want to come with me to the Three Broom-
sticks at lunchtime? I’m meeting Hermione Granger there.”
Cho raised her eyebrows.
“You’re meeting Hermione Granger? Today?”
“Yeah. Well, she asked me to, so I thought I would. D’you want to
come with me? She said it wouldn’t matter if you did.”
“Oh . . . well . . . that was nice of her.”
But Cho did not sound as though she thought it was nice at all; on
the contrary, her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather
forbidding.
A few more minutes passed in total silence, Harry drinking his cof-
fee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup. Next door, Roger
Davies and his girlfriend seemed glued together by the lips.
Cho’s hand was lying on the table beside her coffee, and Harry was
feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it. Just do it, he told him-
self, as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his
chest. Just reach out and grab it. . . . Amazing how much more difficult
it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than to
snatch a speeding Snitch from midair . . .
But just as he moved his hand forward, Cho took hers off the table.

560
THE BEETLE AT BAY
She was now watching Roger Davies kissing his girlfriend with a
mildly interested expression.
“He asked me out, you know,” she said in a quiet voice. “A couple
of weeks ago. Roger. I turned him down, though.”
Harry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lung-
ing movement across the table, could not think why she was telling
him this. If she wished she were sitting at the table next door being
heartily kissed by Roger Davies, why had she agreed to come out with
him?
He said nothing. Their cherub threw another handful of confetti
over them; some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee Harry had
been about to drink.
“I came in here with Cedric last year,” said Cho.
In the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said,
Harry’s insides had become glacial. He could not believe she wanted
to talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples surrounded them and
a cherub floated over their heads.
Cho’s voice was rather higher when she spoke again.
“I’ve been meaning to ask you for ages. . . . Did Cedric — did he
m-m-mention me at all before he died?”
This was the very last subject on earth Harry wanted to discuss, and
least of all with Cho.
“Well — no —” he said quietly. “There — there wasn’t time for
him to say anything. Erm . . . so . . . d’you . . . d’you get to see a lot of
Quidditch in the holidays? You support the Tornados, right?”
His voice sounded falsely bright and cheery. To his horror, he saw
that her eyes were swimming with tears again, just as they had been af-
ter the last D.A. meeting before Christmas.
“Look,” he said desperately, leaning in so that nobody else could
overhear, “let’s not talk about Cedric right now. . . . Let’s talk about
something else. . . .”
But this, apparently, was quite the wrong thing to say.

561
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
“I thought,” she said, tears spattering down onto the table. “I
thought you’d u-u-understand! I need to talk about it! Surely you
n-need to talk about it t-too! I mean, you saw it happen, d-didn’t
you?”
Everything was going nightmarishly wrong; Roger Davies’ girl-
friend had even unglued herself to look around at Cho crying.
“Well — I have talked about it,” Harry said in a whisper, “to Ron
and Hermione, but —”
“Oh, you’ll talk to Hermione Granger!” she said shrilly, her face
now shining with tears, and several more kissing couples broke apart
to stare. “But you won’t talk to me! P-perhaps it would be best if
we just . . . just p-paid and you went and met up with Hermione
G-Granger, like you obviously want to!”
Harry stared at her, utterly bewildered, as she seized a frilly napkin
and dabbed at her shining face with it.
“Cho?” he said weakly, wishing Roger would seize his girlfriend
and start kissing her again to stop her goggling at him and Cho.
“Go on, leave!” she said, now crying into the napkin. “I don’t know
why you asked me out in the first place if you’re going to make
arrangements to meet other girls right after me. . . . How many are
you meeting after Hermione?”
“It’s not like that!” said Harry, and he was so relieved at finally un-
derstanding what she was annoyed about that he laughed, which he
realized a split second too late was a mistake.
Cho sprang to her feet. The whole tearoom was quiet, and every-
body was watching them now.
“I’ll see you around, Harry,” she said dramatically, and hiccuping
slightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open, and hurried off into
the pouring rain.
“Cho!” Harry called after her, but the door had already swung shut
behind her with a tuneful tinkle.
There was total silence within the tea shop. Every eye was upon

562
THE BEETLE AT BAY
Harry. He threw a Galleon down onto the table, shook pink confetti
out of his eyes, and followed Cho out of the door.
It was raining hard now, and she was nowhere to be seen. He sim-
ply did not understand what had happened; half an hour ago they had
been getting along fine.
“Women!” he muttered angrily, sloshing down the rain-washed
street with his hands in his pockets. “What did she want to talk about
Cedric for anyway? Why does she always want to drag up a subject
that makes her act like a human hosepipe?”
He turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within minutes
he was turning into the doorway of the Three Broomsticks. He knew
he was too early to meet Hermione, but he thought it likely there
would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening
time. He shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around. Hagrid
was sitting alone in a corner, looking morose.
“Hi, Hagrid!” he said, when he had squeezed through the crammed
tables and pulled up a chair beside him.
Hagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he barely rec-
ognized him. Harry saw that he had two fresh cuts on his face and sev-
eral new bruises.
“Oh, it’s you, Harry,” said Hagrid. “You all righ’?”
“Yeah, I’m fine,” lied Harry; in fact, next to this battered and
mournful-looking Hagrid, he felt he did not have much to complain
about. “Er — are you okay?”
“Me?” said Hagrid. “Oh yeah, I’m grand, Harry, grand. . . .”
He gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard, which was the size
of a large bucket, and sighed. Harry did not know what to say to him.
They sat side by side in silence for a moment. Then Hagrid said
abruptly, “In the same boat, you an’ me, aren’ we, Harry?”
“Er —” said Harry.
“Yeah . . . I’ve said it before. . . . Both outsiders, like,” said Hagrid,
nodding wisely. “An’ both orphans. Yeah . . . both orphans.”

563
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
He took a great swig from his tankard.
“Makes a diff ’rence, havin’ a decent family,” he said. “Me dad was
decent. An’ your mum an’ dad were decent. If they’d lived, life woulda
bin diff ’rent, eh?”
“Yeah . . . I s’pose,” said Harry cautiously. Hagrid seemed to be in
a very strange mood.
“Family,” said Hagrid gloomily. “Whatever yeh say, blood’s im-
portant. . . .”
And he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye.
“Hagrid,” said Harry, unable to stop himself, “where are you get-
ting all these injuries?”
“Eh?” said Hagrid, looking startled. “Wha’ injuries?”
“All those!” said Harry, pointing at Hagrid’s face.
“Oh . . . tha’s jus’ normal bumps an’ bruises, Harry,” said Hagrid
dismissively. “I got a rough job.”
He drained his tankard, set it back upon the table, and got to his
feet.
“I’ll be seein’ yeh, Harry. . . . Take care now. . . .”
And he lumbered out of the pub looking wretched and then disap-
peared into the torrential rain. Harry watched him go, feeling miser-
able. Hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something, but he
seemed determined not to accept help. What was going on? But be-
fore Harry could think about the matter any further, he heard a voice
calling his name.
“Harry! Harry, over here!”
Hermione was waving at him from the other side of the room. He
got up and made his way toward her through the crowded pub. He
was still a few tables away when he realized that Hermione was not
alone; she was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking
mates he could ever have imagined: Luna Lovegood and none other
than Rita Skeeter, ex-journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of
Hermione’s least favorite people in the world.

564
THE BEETLE AT BAY
“You’re early!” said Hermione, moving along to give him room to
sit down. “I thought you were with Cho, I wasn’t expecting you for
another hour at least!”
“Cho?” said Rita at once, twisting around in her seat to stare avidly
at Harry. “A girl ?”
She snatched up her crocodile-skin handbag and groped within it.
“It’s none of your business if Harry’s been with a hundred girls,”
Hermione told Rita coolly. “So you can put that away right now.”
Rita had been on the point of withdrawing an acid-green quill from
her bag. Looking as though she had been forced to swallow Stinksap,
she snapped her bag shut again.
“What are you up to?” Harry asked, sitting down and staring from
Rita to Luna to Hermione.
“Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived,”
said Rita, taking a large slurp of her drink. “I suppose I’m allowed to
talk to him, am I?” she shot at Hermione.
“Yes, I suppose you are,” said Hermione coldly.
Unemployment did not suit Rita. The hair that had once been set
in elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face. The
scarlet paint on her two-inch talons was chipped and there were a cou-
ple of false jewels missing from her winged glasses. She took another
great gulp of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth,
“Pretty girl, is she, Harry?”
“One more word about Harry’s love life and the deal’s off and that’s
a promise,” said Hermione irritably.
“What deal?” said Rita, wiping her mouth on the back of her hand.
“You haven’t mentioned a deal yet, Miss Prissy, you just told me to turn
up. Oh, one of these days . . .” She took a deep shuddering breath.
“Yes, yes, one of these days you’ll write more horrible stories about
Harry and me,” said Hermione indifferently. “Find someone who
cares, why don’t you?”
“They’ve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year


CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
without my help,” said Rita, shooting a sideways look at him over the
top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper, “How has that made
you feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstood?”
“He feels angry, of course,” said Hermione in a hard, clear voice.
“Because he’s told the Minister of Magic the truth and the Minister’s
too much of an idiot to believe him.”
“So you actually stick to it, do you, that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-
Named is back?” said Rita, lowering her glass and subjecting Harry to
a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the
crocodile bag. “You stand by all this garbage Dumbledore’s been
telling everybody about You-Know-Who returning and you being the
sole witness — ?”
“I wasn’t the sole witness,” snarled Harry. “There were a dozen-odd
Death Eaters there as well. Want their names?”
“I’d love them,” breathed Rita, now fumbling in her bag once more
and gazing at him as though he was the most beautiful thing she had
ever seen. “A great bold headline: ‘Potter Accuses . . .’ A subheading:
‘Harry Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us.’ And then, beneath a
nice big photograph of you: ‘Disturbed teenage survivor of You-Know-
Who’s attack, Harry Potter, 15, caused outrage yesterday by accusing re-
spectable and prominent members of the Wizarding community of being
Death Eaters. . . .’ ”
The Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to
her mouth when the rapturous expression died out of her face.
“But of course,” she said, lowering the quill and looking daggers at
Hermione, “Little Miss Perfect wouldn’t want that story out there,
would she?”
“As a matter of fact,” said Hermione sweetly, “that’s exactly what
Little Miss Perfect does want.”
Rita stared at her. So did Harry. Luna, on the other hand, sang,
“Weasley Is Our King” dreamily under her breath and stirred her
drink with a cocktail onion on a stick.

566
THE BEETLE AT BAY
“You want me to report what he says about He-Who-Must-Not-
Be-Named?” Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice.
“Yes, I do,” said Hermione. “The true story. All the facts. Exactly as
Harry reports them. He’ll give you all the details, he’ll tell you the
names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he’ll tell you
what Voldemort looks like now — oh, get a grip on yourself,” she
added contemptuously, throwing a napkin across the table, for at the
sound of Voldemort’s name, Rita had jumped so badly that she had
slopped half her glass of firewhisky down herself.
Rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat, still staring at
Hermione. Then she said baldly, “The Prophet wouldn’t print it. In
case you haven’t noticed, nobody believes his cock-and-bull story.
Everyone thinks he’s delusional. Now, if you let me write the story
from that angle —”
“We don’t need another story about how Harry’s lost his marbles!”
said Hermione angrily. “We’ve had plenty of those already, thank you!
I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth!”
“There’s no market for a story like that,” said Rita coldly.
“You mean the Prophet won’t print it because Fudge won’t let
them,” said Hermione irritably.
Rita gave Hermione a long, hard look. Then, leaning forward
across the table toward her, she said in a businesslike tone, “All right,
Fudge is leaning on the Prophet, but it comes to the same thing. They
won’t print a story that shows Harry in a good light. Nobody wants to
read it. It’s against the public mood. This last Azkaban breakout has
got people quite worried enough. People just don’t want to believe
You-Know-Who’s back.”
“So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear,
does it?” said Hermione scathingly.
Rita sat up straight again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her
glass of firewhisky.
“The Prophet exists to sell itself, you silly girl,” she said coldly.

“My dad thinks it’s an awful paper,” said Luna, chipping into the
conversation unexpectedly. Sucking on her cocktail onion, she gazed
at Rita with her enormous, protuberant, slightly mad eyes. “He pub-
lishes important stories that he thinks the public needs to know. He
doesn’t care about making money.”
Rita looked disparagingly at Luna.
“I’m guessing your father runs some stupid little village news-
letter?” she said. “ ‘Twenty-five Ways to Mingle with Muggles’ and
the dates of the next Bring-and-Fly Sale?”
“No,” said Luna, dipping her onion back into her gillywater, “he’s
the editor of The Quibbler.”
Rita snorted so loudly that people at a nearby table looked around
in alarm.
“ ‘Important stories he thinks the public needs to know’?” she said
witheringly. “I could manure my garden with the contents of that rag.”
“Well, this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit, isn’t it?” said
Hermione pleasantly. “Luna says her father’s quite happy to take
Harry’s interview. That’s who’ll be publishing it.”
Rita stared at them both for a moment and then let out a great
whoop of laughter.
“The Quibbler!” she said, cackling. “You think people will take him
seriously if he’s published in The Quibbler?”
“Some people won’t,” said Hermione in a level voice. “But the
Daily Prophet’s version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping
holes in it. I think a lot of people will be wondering whether there isn’t
a better explanation of what happened, and if there’s an alternative
story available, even if it is published in a” — she glanced sideways at
Luna, “in a — well, an unusual magazine — I think they might be
rather keen to read it.”
Rita did not say anything for a while, but eyed Hermione shrewdly,
her head a little to one side.

568
THE BEETLE AT BAY
“All right, let’s say for a moment I’ll do it,” she said abruptly. “What
kind of fee am I going to get?”
“I don’t think Daddy exactly pays people to write for the maga-
zine,” said Luna dreamily. “They do it because it’s an honor, and, of
course, to see their names in print.”
Rita Skeeter looked as though the taste of Stinksap was strong in
her mouth again as she rounded on Hermione. “I’m supposed to do
this for free?”
“Well, yes,” said Hermione calmly, taking a sip of her drink. “Other-
wise, as you very well know, I will inform the authorities that you are
an unregistered Animagus. Of course, the Prophet might give you
rather a lot for an insider’s account of life in Azkaban. . . .”
Rita looked as though she would have liked nothing better than to
seize the paper umbrella sticking out of Hermione’s drink and thrust
it up her nose.
“I don’t suppose I’ve got any choice, have I?” said Rita, her voice
shaking slightly. She opened her crocodile bag once more, withdrew a
piece of parchment, and raised her Quick-Quotes Quill.
“Daddy will be pleased,” said Luna brightly. A muscle twitched in
Rita’s jaw.
“Okay, Harry?” said Hermione, turning to him. “Ready to tell the
public the truth?”
“I suppose,” said Harry, watching Rita balancing the Quick-
Quotes Quill at the ready on the parchment between them.
“Fire away, then, Rita,” said Hermione serenely, fishing a cherry
out of the bottom of her glass.

una said vaguely that she did not know how soon Rita’s interview
with Harry would appear in The Quibbler, that her father was ex-
pecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple-Horned
Snorkacks. “And, of course, that’ll be a very important story, so
Harry’s might have to wait for the following issue,” said Luna.
Harry had not found it an easy experience to talk about the night
when Voldemort had returned. Rita had pressed him for every little
detail, and he had given her everything he could remember, knowing
that this was his one big opportunity to tell the world the truth. He
wondered how people would react to the story. He guessed that it
would confirm a lot of people in the view that he was completely in-
sane, not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter
rubbish about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. But the breakout of Bel-
latrix Lestrange and her fellow Death Eaters had given Harry a burn-
ing desire to do something, whether it worked or not. . . .
“Can’t wait to see what Umbridge thinks of you going public,” said
Dean, sounding awestruck at dinner on Monday night. Seamus was

570
SEEN AND UNFORESEEN
shoveling down large amounts of chicken-and-ham pie on Dean’s
other side, but Harry knew he was listening.
“It’s the right thing to do, Harry,” said Neville, who was sitting op-
posite him. He was rather pale, but went on in a low voice, “It must
have been . . . tough . . . talking about it. . . . Was it?”
“Yeah,” mumbled Harry, “but people have got to know what
Voldemort’s capable of, haven’t they?”
“That’s right,” said Neville, nodding, “and his Death Eaters too . . .
People should know. . . .”
Neville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato.
Seamus looked up, but when he caught Harry’s eye he looked quickly
back at his plate again. After a while Dean, Seamus, and Neville de-
parted for the common room, leaving Harry and Hermione at the
table waiting for Ron, who had not yet had dinner because of Quid-
ditch practice.
Cho Chang walked into the hall with her friend Marietta. Harry’s
stomach gave an unpleasant lurch, but she did not look over at the
Gryffindor table and sat down with her back to him.
“Oh, I forgot to ask you,” said Hermione brightly, glancing over at
the Ravenclaw table, “what happened on your date with Cho? How
come you were back so early?”
“Er . . . well, it was . . .” said Harry, pulling a dish of rhubarb
crumble toward him and helping himself to seconds, “a complete fi-
asco, now you mention it.”
And he told her what had happened in Madam Puddifoot’s Tea
Shop.
“. . . so then,” he finished several minutes later, as the final bit of
crumble disappeared, “she jumps up, right, and says ‘I’ll see you
around, Harry,’ and runs out of the place!” He put down his spoon
and looked at Hermione. “I mean, what was all that about? What was
going on?”


CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
Hermione glanced over at the back of Cho’s head and sighed. “Oh,
Harry,” she said sadly. “Well, I’m sorry, but you were a bit tactless.”
“Me, tactless?” said Harry, outraged. “One minute we were getting
on fine, next minute she was telling me that Roger Davies asked her
out, and how she used to go and snog Cedric in that stupid tea
shop — how was I supposed to feel about that?”
“Well, you see,” said Hermione, with the patient air of one ex-
plaining that one plus one equals two to an overemotional toddler,
“you shouldn’t have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway
through your date.”
“But, but,” spluttered Harry, “but — you told me to meet you at
twelve and to bring her along, how was I supposed to do that without
telling her — ?”
“You should have told her differently” said Hermione, still with
that maddeningly patient air. “You should have said it was really an-
noying, but I’d made you promise to come along to the Three Broom-
sticks, and you really didn’t want to go, you’d much rather spend the
whole day with her, but unfortunately you thought you really ought
to meet me and would she please, please come along with you, and
hopefully you’d be able to get away more quickly? And it might have
been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am too,” Hermi-
one added as an afterthought.
“But I don’t think you’re ugly,” said Harry, bemused.
Hermione laughed.
“Harry, you’re worse than Ron. . . . Well, no, you’re not,” she
sighed, as Ron himself came stumping into the Hall splattered with
mud and looking grumpy. “Look — you upset Cho when you said
you were going to meet me, so she tried to make you jealous. It was
her way of trying to find out how much you liked her.”
“Is that what she was doing?” said Harry as Ron dropped onto the
bench opposite them and pulled every dish within reach toward him-

572
SEEN AND UNFORESEEN
self. “Well, wouldn’t it have been easier if she’d just asked me whether
I liked her better than you?”
“Girls don’t often ask questions like that,” said Hermione.
“Well, they should!” said Harry forcefully. “Then I could’ve just
told her I fancy her, and she wouldn’t have had to get herself all
worked up again about Cedric dying!”
“I’m not saying what she did was sensible,” said Hermione, as
Ginny joined them, just as muddy as Ron and looking equally dis-
gruntled. “I’m just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the
time.”
“You should write a book,” Ron told Hermione as he cut up his
potatoes, “translating mad things girls do so boys can understand
them.”
“Yeah,” said Harry fervently, looking over at the Ravenclaw table.
Cho had just got up; still not looking at him, she left the Great Hall.
Feeling rather depressed, he looked back at Ron and Ginny. “So, how
was Quidditch practice?”
“It was a nightmare,” said Ron in a surly voice.
“Oh come on,” said Hermione, looking at Ginny, “I’m sure it
wasn’t that —”
“Yes, it was,” said Ginny. “It was appalling. Angelina was nearly in
tears by the end of it.”
Ron and Ginny went off for baths after dinner; Harry and Her-
mione returned to the busy Gryffindor common room and their usual
pile of homework. Harry had been struggling with a new star chart for
Astronomy for half an hour when Fred and George turned up.
“Ron and Ginny not here?” asked Fred, looking around as he
pulled up a chair and, when Harry shook his head, he said, “Good.
We were watching their practice. They’re going to be slaughtered.
They’re complete rubbish without us.”
“Come on, Ginny’s not bad,” said George fairly, sitting down next

573
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
to Fred. “Actually, I dunno how she got so good, seeing how we never
let her play with us. . . .”
“She’s been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the
age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you
weren’t looking,” said Hermione from behind her tottering pile of An-
cient Rune books.
“Oh,” said George, looking mildly impressed. “Well — that’d ex-
plain it.”
“Has Ron saved a goal yet?” asked Hermione, peering over the top
of Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms.
“Well, he can do it if he doesn’t think anyone’s watching him,” said
Fred, rolling his eyes. “So all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn
their backs and talk among themselves every time the Quaffle goes up
his end on Saturday.”
He got up again and moved restlessly to the window, staring out
across the dark grounds.
“You know, Quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth
staying for.”
Hermione cast him a stern look.
“You’ve got exams coming!”
“Told you already, we’re not fussed about N.E.W.T.s,” said Fred.
“The Snackboxes are ready to roll, we found out how to get rid of
those boils, just a couple of drops of murtlap essence sorts them, Lee
put us onto it. . . .”
George yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy
night sky.
“I dunno if I even want to watch this match. If Zacharias Smith
beats us I might have to kill myself.”
“Kill him, more like,” said Fred firmly.
“That’s the trouble with Quidditch,” said Hermione absentmind-
edly, once again bent over her Rune translation, “it creates all this bad
feeling and tension between the Houses.”

574
SEEN AND UNFORESEEN
She looked up to find her copy of Spellman’s Syllabary and caught
Fred, George, and Harry looking at her with expressions of mingled
disgust and incredulity on their faces.
“Well, it does!” she said impatiently. “It’s only a game, isn’t it?”
“Hermione,” said Harry, shaking his head, “you’re good on feelings
and stuff, but you just don’t understand about Quidditch.”
“Maybe not,” she said darkly, returning to her translation again, “but
at least my happiness doesn’t depend on Ron’s goalkeeping ability.”
And though Harry would rather have jumped off the Astronomy
Tower than admit it to her, by the time he had watched the game the
following Saturday he would have given any number of Galleons not
to care about Quidditch either.
The very best thing you could say about the match was that it was
short; the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty-two min-
utes of agony. It was hard to say what the worst thing was: Harry
thought it was a close-run contest between Ron’s fourteenth failed save,
Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his
bat, and Kirke shrieking and falling backward off his broom as Zacha-
rias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle. The miracle was that
Gryffindor only lost by ten points: Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch
from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby’s nose, so that the final
score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty.
“Good catch,” Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where
the atmosphere closely resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral.
“I was lucky,” she shrugged. “It wasn’t a very fast Snitch and Sum-
merby’s got a cold, he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong
moment. Anyway, once you’re back on the team —”
“Ginny, I’ve got a lifelong ban.”
“You’re banned as long as Umbridge is in the school,” Ginny cor-
rected him. “There’s a difference. Anyway, once you’re back, I think
I’ll try out for Chaser. Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year
and I prefer goal-scoring to Seeking anyway.”

575
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
Harry looked over at Ron, who was hunched in a corner, staring at
his knees, a bottle of butterbeer clutched in his hand.
“Angelina still won’t let him resign,” Ginny said, as though reading
Harry’s mind. “She says she knows he’s got it in him.”
Harry liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in Ron, but at
the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the
team. Ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of “Weasley
Is Our King” sung with great gusto by the Slytherins, who were now
favorites to win the Quidditch Cup.
Fred and George wandered over.
“I haven’t got the heart to take the mickey out of him, even,” said
Fred, looking over at Ron’s crumpled figure. “Mind you . . . when he
missed the fourteenth . . .”
He made wild motions with his arms as though doing an upright
doggy-paddle.
“Well, I’ll save it for parties, eh?”
Ron dragged himself up to bed shortly after this. Out of respect for
his feelings, Harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory
himself, so that Ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to. Sure
enough, when Harry finally entered the room Ron was snoring a little
too loudly to be entirely plausible.
Harry got into bed, thinking about the match. It had been im-
mensely frustrating watching from the sidelines. He was quite im-
pressed by Ginny’s performance but he felt that if he had been playing
he could have caught the Snitch sooner. . . . There had been a mo-
ment when it had been fluttering near Kirke’s ankle; if she hadn’t hes-
itated, she might have been able to scrape a win for Gryffindor. . . .
Umbridge had been sitting a few rows below Harry and Hermione.
Once or twice she had turned squatly in her seat to look at him, her
wide toad’s mouth stretched in what he thought had been a gloating
smile. The memory of it made him feel hot with anger as he lay there

576
SEEN AND UNFORESEEN
in the dark. After a few minutes, however, he remembered that he was
supposed to be emptying his mind of all emotion before he slept, as
Snape kept instructing him at the end of every Occlumency lesson.
He tried for a moment or two, but the thought of Snape on top of
memories of Umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling re-
sentment, and he found himself focusing instead on how much he
loathed the pair of them. Slowly, Ron’s snores died away, replaced by
the sound of deep, slow breathing. It took Harry much longer to get
to sleep; his body was tired, but it took his brain a long time to close
down.
He dreamed that Neville and Professor Sprout were waltzing
around the Room of Requirement while Professor McGonagall
played the bagpipes. He watched them happily for a while, then de-
cided to go and find the other members of the D.A. . . .
But when he left the room he found himself facing, not the tapes-
try of Barnabas the Barmy, but a torch burning in its bracket on a
stone wall. He turned his head slowly to the left. There, at the far end
of the windowless passage, was a plain, black door.
He walked toward it with a sense of mounting excitement. He had
the strangest feeling that this time he was going to get lucky at last,
and find the way to open it. . . . He was feet from it and saw with a
leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light
down the right-hand side. . . . The door was ajar. . . . He stretched
out his hand to push it wide and —
Ron gave a loud, rasping, genuine snore, and Harry awoke abruptly
with his right hand stretched in front of him in the darkness, to open
a door that was hundreds of miles away. He let it fall with a feeling of
mingled disappointment and guilt. He knew he should not have seen
the door, but at the same time, felt so consumed with curiosity about
what was behind it that he could not help feeling annoyed with Ron.
. . . If he could have saved his snore for just another minute . . .

They entered the Great Hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment
as the post owls on Monday morning. Hermione was not the only
person eagerly awaiting her Daily Prophet: Nearly everyone was eager
for more news about the escaped Death Eaters, who, despite many re-
ported sightings, had still not been caught. She gave the delivery owl
a Knut and unfolded the newspaper eagerly while Harry helped him-
self to orange juice; as he had only received one note during the entire
year he was sure, when the first owl landed with a thud in front of
him, that it had made a mistake.
“Who’re you after?” he asked it, languidly removing his orange
juice from underneath its beak and leaning forward to see the recipi-
ent’s name and address:
Harry Potter
Great Hall
Hogwarts School
Frowning, he made to take the letter from the owl, but before he
could do so, three, four, five more owls had fluttered down beside it
and were jockeying for position, treading in the butter, knocking over
the salt, and each attempting to give him their letters first.
“What’s going on?” Ron asked in amazement, as the whole of
Gryffindor table leaned forward to watch as another seven owls
landed amongst the first ones, screeching, hooting, and flapping their
wings.
“Harry!” said Hermione breathlessly, plunging her hands into the
feathery mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical
package. “I think I know what this means — open this one first!”
Harry ripped off the brown packaging. Out rolled a tightly furled
copy of March’s edition of The Quibbler. He unrolled it to see his own

578
SEEN AND UNFORESEEN
face grinning sheepishly at him from the front cover. In large red let-
ters across his picture were the words:
HARRY POTTER SPEAKS OUT AT LAST:
THE TRUTH ABOUT HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED
AND THE NIGHT I SAW HIM RETURN
“It’s good, isn’t it?” said Luna, who had drifted over to the
Gryffindor table and now squeezed herself onto the bench between
Fred and Ron. “It came out yesterday, I asked Dad to send you a free
copy. I expect all these,” she waved a hand at the assembled owls still
scrabbling around on the table in front of Harry, “are letters from
readers.”
“That’s what I thought,” said Hermione eagerly, “Harry, d’you
mind if we — ?”
“Help yourself,” said Harry, feeling slightly bemused.
Ron and Hermione both started ripping open envelopes.
“This one’s from a bloke who thinks you’re off your rocker,” said
Ron, glancing down his letter. “Ah well . . .”
“This woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at
St. Mungo’s,” said Hermione, looking disappointed and crumpling
up a second.
“This one looks okay, though,” said Harry slowly, scanning a long
letter from a witch in Paisley. “Hey, she says she believes me!”
“This one’s in two minds,” said Fred, who had joined in the letter-
opening with enthusiasm. “Says you don’t come across as a mad per-
son, but he really doesn’t want to believe You-Know-Who’s back so he
doesn’t know what to think now. . . . Blimey, what a waste of parch-
ment . . .”
“Here’s another one you’ve convinced, Harry!” said Hermione ex-
citedly. “ ‘Having read your side of the story I am forced to the con-
clusion that the Daily Prophet has treated you very unfairly. . . . Little

579
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
though I want to think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has re-
turned, I am forced to accept that you are telling the truth. . . .’ Oh
this is wonderful!”
“Another one who thinks you’re barking,” said Ron, throwing a
crumpled letter over his shoulder, “but this one says you’ve got her
converted, and she now thinks you’re a real hero — she’s put in a pho-
tograph too — wow —”
“What is going on here?” said a falsely sweet, girlish voice.
Harry looked up with his hands full of envelopes. Professor Um-
bridge was standing behind Fred and Luna, her bulging toad’s eyes
scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front of Harry.
Behind her he saw many of the students watching them avidly.
“Why have you got all these letters, Mr. Potter?” she asked slowly.
“Is that a crime now?” said Fred loudly. “Getting mail?”
“Be careful, Mr. Weasley, or I shall have to put you in detention,”
said Umbridge. “Well, Mr. Potter?”
Harry hesitated, but he did not see how he could keep what he had
done quiet; it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of The
Quibbler came to Umbridge’s attention.
“People have written to me because I gave an interview,” said
Harry. “About what happened to me last June.”
For some reason he glanced up at the staff table as he said this. He
had the strangest feeling that Dumbledore had been watching him a
second before, but when he looked, Dumbledore seemed to be ab-
sorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick.
“An interview?” repeated Umbridge, her voice thinner and higher
than ever. “What do you mean?”
“I mean a reporter asked me questions and I answered them,” said
Harry. “Here —”
And he threw the copy of The Quibbler at her. She caught it and
stared down at the cover. Her pale, doughy face turned an ugly, patchy
violet.

580
SEEN AND UNFORESEEN
“When did you do this?” she asked, her voice trembling slightly.
“Last Hogsmeade weekend,” said Harry.
She looked up at him, incandescent with rage, the magazine shak-
ing in her stubby fingers.
“There will be no more Hogsmeade trips for you, Mr. Potter,” she
whispered. “How you dare . . . how you could . . .” She took a deep
breath. “I have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies. The
message, apparently, has still not sunk in. Fifty points from Gryffin-
dor and another week’s worth of detentions.”
She stalked away, clutching The Quibbler to her chest, the eyes of
many students following her.
By mid-morning enormous signs had been put up all over the
school, not just on House notice boards, but in the corridors and class-
rooms too.
— by order of —
The High Inquisitor of Hogwarts
Any student found in possession of the magazine The Quib-
bler will be expelled.
The above is in accordance with
Educational Decree Number Twenty-seven.
Signed:
high inquisitor
For some reason, every time Hermione caught sight of one of these
signs she beamed with pleasure.
“What exactly are you so happy about?” Harry asked her.

581
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
“Oh Harry, don’t you see?” Hermione breathed. “If she could have
done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this
school will read your interview, it was banning it!”
And it seemed that Hermione was quite right. By the end of that
day, though Harry had not seen so much as a corner of The Quibbler
anywhere in the school, the whole place seemed to be quoting the in-
terview at each other; Harry heard them whispering about it as they
queued up outside classes, discussing it over lunch and in the back of
lessons, while Hermione even reported that every occupant of the cu-
bicles in the girls’ toilets had been talking about it when she nipped in
there before Ancient Runes.
“And then they spotted me, and obviously they know I know you,
so they were bombarding me with questions,” Hermione told Harry,
her eyes shining, “and Harry, I think they believe you, I really do, I
think you’ve finally got them convinced!”
Meanwhile Professor Umbridge was stalking the school, stopping
students at random and demanding that they turn out their books
and pockets. Harry knew she was looking for copies of The Quibbler,
but the students were several steps ahead of her. The pages carrying
Harry’s interview had been bewitched to resemble extracts from text-
books if anyone but themselves read it, or else wiped magically blank
until they wanted to peruse it again. Soon it seemed that every single
person in the school had read it.
The teachers were, of course, forbidden from mentioning the in-
terview by Educational Decree Number Twenty-six, but they found
ways to express their feelings about it all the same. Professor Sprout
awarded Gryffindor twenty points when Harry passed her a watering
can; a beaming Professor Flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar
mice on him at the end of Charms, said “Shh!” and hurried away; and
Professor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during Divination and
announced to the startled class, and a very disapproving Umbridge,
that Harry was not going to suffer an early death after all, but would

582
SEEN AND UNFORESEEN
live to a ripe old age, become Minister of Magic, and have twelve
children.
But what made Harry happiest was Cho catching up with him as
he was hurrying along to Transfiguration the next day. Before he knew
what had happened her hand was in his and she was breathing in his
ear, “I’m really, really sorry. That interview was so brave . . . it made
me cry.”
He was sorry to hear she had shed even more tears over it, but very
glad they were on speaking terms again, and even more pleased when
she gave him a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again. And un-
believably, no sooner had he arrived outside Transfiguration than
something just as good happened: Seamus stepped out of the queue to
face him.
“I just wanted to say,” he mumbled, squinting at Harry’s left knee,
“I believe you. And I’ve sent a copy of that magazine to me mam.”
If anything more was needed to complete Harry’s happiness, it was
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s reactions. He saw them with their heads
together later that afternoon in the library, together with a weedy-
looking boy Hermione whispered was called Theodore Nott. They
looked around at Harry as he browsed the shelves for the book he
needed on Partial Vanishment, and Goyle cracked his knuckles threat-
eningly and Malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to
Crabbe. Harry knew perfectly well why they were acting like this: He
had named all of their fathers as Death Eaters.
“And the best bit is,” whispered Hermione gleefully as they left the
library, “they can’t contradict you, because they can’t admit they’ve
read the article!”
To cap it all, Luna told him over dinner that no copy of The Quib-
bler had ever sold out faster.
“Dad’s reprinting!” she told Harry, her eyes popping excitedly. “He
can’t believe it, he says people seem even more interested in this than
the Crumple-Horned Snorkacks!”


CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night; dar-
ingly, Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front
cover of The Quibbler and hung it on the wall, so that Harry’s giant
head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally saying things
like “The Ministry are morons” and “Eat dung, Umbridge” in a
booming voice. Hermione did not find this very amusing; she said it
interfered with her concentration, and ended up going to bed early
out of irritation. Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as
funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had
started to wear off, so that it merely shouted disconnected words like
“Dung” and “Umbridge” at more and more frequent intervals in a
progressively higher voice. In fact it started to make his head ache and
his scar began prickling uncomfortably again. To disappointed moans
from the many people who were sitting around him, asking him to re-
live his interview for the umpteenth time, he announced that he too
needed an early night.
The dormitory was empty when he reached it. He rested his fore-
head for a moment against the cool glass of the window beside his
bed; it felt soothing against his scar. Then he undressed and got into
bed, wishing his headache would go away. He also felt slightly sick.
He rolled over onto his side, closed his eyes, and fell asleep almost at
once. . . .
He was standing in a dark, curtained room lit by a single branch of
candles. His hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of
him. They were long-fingered and white as though they had not seen
sunlight for years and looked like large, pale spiders against the dark
velvet of the chair.
Beyond the chair, in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the can-
dles, knelt a man in black robes.
“I have been badly advised, it seems,” said Harry, in a high, cold
voice that pulsed with anger.
“Master, I crave your pardon. . . .” croaked the man kneeling on

584
SEEN AND UNFORESEEN
the floor. The back of his head glimmered in the candlelight. He
seemed to be trembling.
“I do not blame you, Rookwood,” said Harry in that cold, cruel
voice.
He relinquished his grip upon the chair and walked around it,
closer to the man cowering upon the floor, until he stood directly over
him in the darkness, looking down from a far greater height than
usual.
“You are sure of your facts, Rookwood?” asked Harry.
“Yes, My Lord, yes . . . I used to work in the department after —
after all. . . .”
“Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it.”
“Bode could never have taken it, Master. . . . Bode would have
known he could not. . . . Undoubtedly that is why he fought so hard
against Malfoy’s Imperius Curse. . . .”
“Stand up, Rookwood,” whispered Harry.
The kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey. His face was
pockmarked; the scars were thrown into relief by the candlelight. He
remained a little stooped when standing, as though halfway through a
bow, and he darted terrified looks up at Harry’s face.
“You have done well to tell me this,” said Harry. “Very well . . . I
have wasted months on fruitless schemes, it seems. . . . But no matter
. . . We begin again, from now. You have Lord Voldemort’s gratitude,
Rookwood. . . .”
“My Lord . . . yes, My Lord,” gasped Rookwood, his voice hoarse
with relief.
“I shall need your help. I shall need all the information you can give
me.”
“Of course, My Lord, of course . . . anything . . .”
“Very well . . . you may go. Send Avery to me.”
Rookwood scurried backward, bowing, and disappeared through a
door.

585
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
Left alone in the dark room, Harry turned toward the wall. A
cracked, age-spotted mirror hung on the wall in the shadows. Harry
moved toward it. His reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness.
. . . A face whiter than a skull . . . red eyes with slits for pupils . . .
“NOOOOOOOOO!”
“What?” yelled a voice nearby.
Harry flailed around madly, became entangled in the hangings, and
fell out of his bed. For a few seconds he did not know where he was;
he was convinced that he was about to see the white, skull-like face
looming at him out of the dark again, then Ron’s voice spoke very
near to him.
“Will you stop acting like a maniac, and I can get you out of here!”
Ron wrenched the hangings apart, and Harry stared up at him in
the moonlight, as he lay flat on his back, his scar searing with pain.
Ron looked as though he had just been getting ready for bed; one arm
was out of his robes.
“Has someone been attacked again?” asked Ron, pulling Harry
roughly to his feet. “Is it Dad? Is it that snake?”
“No — everyone’s fine —” gasped Harry, whose forehead felt as
though it was on fire again. “Well . . . Avery isn’t. . . . He’s in trouble.
. . . He gave him the wrong information. . . . He’s really angry. . . .”
Harry groaned and sank, shaking, onto his bed, rubbing his scar.
“But Rookwood’s going to help him now. . . . He’s on the right
track again. . . .”
“What are you talking about?” said Ron, sounding scared. “D’you
mean . . . did you just see You-Know-Who?”
“I was You-Know-Who,” said Harry, and he stretched out his
hands in the darkness and held them up to his face to check that they
were no longer deathly white and long-fingered. “He was with Rook-
wood, he’s one of the Death Eaters who escaped from Azkaban, re-
member? Rookwood’s just told him Bode couldn’t have done it. . . .”

586
SEEN AND UNFORESEEN
“Done what?”
“Remove something. . . . He said Bode would have known he
couldn’t have done it. . . . Bode was under the Imperius Curse. . . . I
think he said Malfoy’s dad put it on him. . . .”
“Bode was bewitched to remove something?” Ron said. “But —
Harry, that’s got to be —”
“The weapon,” Harry finished the sentence for him. “I know.”
The dormitory door opened; Dean and Seamus came in. Harry
swung his legs back into bed. He did not want to look as though any-
thing odd had just happened, seeing as Seamus had only just stopped
thinking Harry was a nutter.
“Did you say,” murmured Ron, putting his head close to Harry’s on
the pretense of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside
table, “that you were You-Know-Who?”
“Yeah,” said Harry quietly.
Ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water. Harry saw it spill
over his chin onto his chest.
“Harry,” he said, as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily,
pulling off their robes, and talking, “you’ve got to tell —”
“I haven’t got to tell anyone,” said Harry shortly. “I wouldn’t have
seen it at all if I could do Occlumency. I’m supposed to have learned
to shut this stuff out. That’s what they want.”
By “they” he meant Dumbledore. He got back into bed and rolled
over onto his side with his back to Ron and after a while he heard Ron’s
mattress creak as he lay back down too. His scar began to burn; he bit
hard on his pillow to stop himself making a noise. Somewhere, he
knew, Avery was being punished. . . .
Harry and Ron waited until break next morning to tell Hermione ex-
actly what had happened. They wanted to be absolutely sure they
could not be overheard. Standing in their usual corner of the cool and


CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
breezy courtyard, Harry told her every detail of the dream he could
remember. When he had finished, she said nothing at all for a few
moments, but stared with a kind of painful intensity at Fred and
George, who were both headless and selling their magical hats from
under their cloaks on the other side of the yard.
“So that’s why they killed him,” she said quietly, withdrawing her
gaze from Fred and George at last. “When Bode tried to steal this
weapon, something funny happened to him. I think there must be
defensive spells on it, or around it, to stop people from touching it.
That’s why he was in St. Mungo’s, his brain had gone all funny and he
couldn’t talk. But remember what the Healer told us? He was recov-
ering. And they couldn’t risk him getting better, could they? I mean,
the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon prob-
ably made the Imperius Curse lift. Once he’d got his voice back, he’d
explain what he’d been doing, wouldn’t he? They would have known
he’d been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been easy
for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. Never out of the Ministry,
is he?”
“He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,” said
Harry. “In the — hang on . . .” he said slowly. “He was in the De-
partment of Mysteries corridor that day! Your dad said he was proba-
bly trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing,
but what if —”
“Sturgis,” gasped Hermione, looking thunderstruck.
“Sorry?” said Ron, looking bewildered.
“Sturgis Podmore,” said Hermione, breathlessly. “Arrested for try-
ing to get through a door. Lucius Malfoy got him too. I bet he did it
the day you saw him there, Harry. Sturgis had Moody’s Invisibility
Cloak, right? So what if he was standing guard by the door, invisible,
and Malfoy heard him move, or guessed he was there, or just did the
Imperius Curse on the off chance that a guard was there? So when
Sturgis next had an opportunity — probably when it was his turn on


guard duty again — he tried to get into the department to steal the
weapon for Voldemort — Ron, be quiet — but he got caught and
sent to Azkaban. . . .”
She gazed at Harry.
“And now Rookwood’s told Voldemort how to get the weapon?”
“I didn’t hear all the conversation, but that’s what it sounded like,”
said Harry. “Rookwood used to work there. . . . Maybe Voldemort’ll
send Rookwood to do it?”
Hermione nodded, apparently still lost in thought. Then, quite
abruptly, she said, “But you shouldn’t have seen this at all, Harry.”
“What?” he said, taken aback.
“You’re supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort
of thing,” said Hermione, suddenly stern.
“I know I am,” said Harry. “But —”
“Well, I think we should just try and forget what you saw,” said
Hermione firmly. “And you ought to put in a bit more effort on your
Occlumency from now on.”
Harry was so angry with her that he did not talk to her for the rest
of the day, which proved to be another bad one. When people were
not discussing the escaped Death Eaters in the corridors today, they
were laughing at Gryffindor’s abysmal performance in their match
against Hufflepuff; the Slytherins were singing “Weasley Is Our King”
so loudly and frequently that by sundown Filch had banned it from
the corridors out of sheer irritation.
The week did not improve as it progressed: Harry received two
more D’s in Potions, was still on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get
the sack, and could not stop himself from dwelling on the dream in
which he had seen Voldemort, though he did not bring it up with Ron
and Hermione again because he did not want another telling-off from
Hermione. He wished very much that he could have talked to Sirius
about it, but that was out of the question, so he tried to push the mat-
ter to the back of his mind.

589
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
Unfortunately, the back of his mind was no longer the secure place
it had once been.
“Get up, Potter.”
A couple of weeks after his dream of Rookwood, Harry was to be
found, yet again, kneeling on the floor of Snape’s office, trying to clear
his head. He had just been forced, yet again, to relive a stream of very
early memories he had not even realized he still had, most of them
concerning humiliations Dudley and his gang had inflicted upon him
in primary school.
“That last memory,” said Snape. “What was it?”
“I don’t know,” said Harry, getting wearily to his feet. He was find-
ing it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the
rush of images and sound that Snape kept calling forth. “You mean
the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet?”
“No,” said Snape softly. “I mean the one concerning a man kneel-
ing in the middle of a darkened room. . . .”
“It’s . . . nothing,” said Harry.
Snape’s dark eyes bored into Harry’s. Remembering what Snape
had said about eye contact being crucial to Legilimency, Harry
blinked and looked away.
“How do that man and that room come to be inside your head,
Potter?” said Snape.
“It —” said Harry, looking everywhere but at Snape, “it was — just
a dream I had.”
“A dream,” repeated Snape.
There was a pause during which Harry stared fixedly at a large dead
frog suspended in a purple liquid in its jar.
“You do know why we are here, don’t you, Potter?” said Snape in a
low, dangerous voice. “You do know why I am giving up my evenings
to this tedious job?”
“Yes,” said Harry stiffly.
“Remind me why we are here, Potter.”

590
SEEN AND UNFORESEEN
“So I can learn Occlumency,” said Harry, now glaring at a dead eel.
“Correct, Potter. And dim though you may be” — Harry looked
back at Snape, hating him — “I would have thought that after two
months’ worth of lessons you might have made some progress. How
many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had?”
“Just that one,” lied Harry.
“Perhaps,” said Snape, his dark, cold eyes narrowing slightly, “per-
haps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams, Potter.
Maybe they make you feel special — important?”
“No, they don’t,” said Harry, his jaw set and his fingers clenched
tightly around the handle of his wand.
“That is just as well, Potter,” said Snape coldly, “because you are
neither special nor important, and it is not up to you to find out what
the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters.”
“No — that’s your job, isn’t it?” Harry shot at him.
He had not meant to say it; it had burst out of him in temper. For
a long moment they stared at each other, Harry convinced he had
gone too far. But there was a curious, almost satisfied expression on
Snape’s face when he answered.
“Yes, Potter,” he said, his eyes glinting. “That is my job. Now, if you
are ready, we will start again. . . .”
He raised his wand. “One — two — three — Legilimens!”
A hundred dementors were swooping toward Harry across the lake
in the grounds. . . . He screwed up his face in concentration. . . .
They were coming closer. . . . He could see the dark holes beneath
their hoods . . . yet he could also see Snape standing in front of him,
his eyes fixed upon Harry’s face, muttering under his breath. . . . And
somehow, Snape was growing clearer, and the dementors were grow-
ing fainter . . .
Harry raised his own wand.
“Protego!”
Snape staggered; his wand flew upward, away from Harry — and

591
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
suddenly Harry’s mind was teeming with memories that were not
his — a hook-nosed man was shouting at a cowering woman, while a
small dark-haired boy cried in a corner. . . . A greasy-haired teenager
sat alone in a dark bedroom, pointing his wand at the ceiling, shoot-
ing down flies. . . . A girl was laughing as a scrawny boy tried to
mount a bucking broomstick —
“ENOUGH!”
Harry felt as though he had been pushed hard in the chest; he took
several staggering steps backward, hit some of the shelves covering
Snape’s walls and heard something crack. Snape was shaking slightly,
very white in the face.
The back of Harry’s robes were damp. One of the jars behind him
had broken when he fell against it; the pickled slimy thing within was
swirling in its draining potion.
“Reparo!” hissed Snape, and the jar sealed itself once more. “Well,
Potter . . . that was certainly an improvement. . . .” Panting slightly,
Snape straightened the Pensieve in which he had again stored some of
his thoughts before starting the lesson, almost as though checking that
they were still there. “I don’t remember telling you to use a Shield
Charm . . . but there is no doubt that it was effective. . . .”
Harry did not speak; he felt that to say anything might be danger-
ous. He was sure he had just broken into Snape’s memories, that he had
just seen scenes from Snape’s childhood, and it was unnerving to think
that the crying little boy who had watched his parents shouting was ac-
tually standing in front of him with such loathing in his eyes. . . .
“Let’s try again, shall we?” said Snape.
Harry felt a thrill of dread: He was about to pay for what had just
happened, he was sure of it. They moved back into position with the
desk between them, Harry feeling he was going to find it much harder
to empty his mind this time. . . .
“On the count of three, then,” said Snape, raising his wand once
more. “One — two —”

592
SEEN AND UNFORESEEN
Harry did not have time to gather himself together and attempt to
clear his mind, for Snape had already cried “Legilimens!”
He was hurtling along the corridor toward the Department of Mys-
teries, past the blank stone walls, past the torches — the plain black
door was growing ever larger; he was moving so fast he was going to
collide with it, he was feet from it and he could see that chink of faint
blue light again —
The door had flown open! He was through it at last, inside a black-
walled, black-floored circular room lit with blue-flamed candles, and
there were more doors all around him — he needed to go on — but
which door ought he to take — ?
“POTTER!”
Harry opened his eyes. He was flat on his back again with no
memory of having gotten there; he was also panting as though he re-
ally had run the length of the Department of Mysteries corridor, really
had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room. . . .
“Explain yourself!” said Snape, who was standing over him, look-
ing furious.
“I . . . dunno what happened,” said Harry truthfully, standing up.
There was a lump on the back of his head from where he had hit the
ground and he felt feverish. “I’ve never seen that before. I mean, I told
you, I’ve dreamed about the door . . . but it’s never opened before. . . .”
“You are not working hard enough!”
For some reason, Snape seemed even angrier than he had done two
minutes before, when Harry had seen into his own memories.
“You are lazy and sloppy, Potter, it is small wonder that the Dark
Lord —”
“Can you tell me something, sir?” said Harry, firing up again.
“Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord, I’ve only ever heard
Death Eaters call him that —”
Snape opened his mouth in a snarl — and a woman screamed from
somewhere outside the room.

593
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
Snape’s head jerked upward; he was gazing at the ceiling.
“What the — ?” he muttered.
Harry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what he
thought might be the entrance hall. Snape looked around at him,
frowning.
“Did you see anything unusual on your way down here, Potter?”
Harry shook his head. Somewhere above them, the woman
screamed again. Snape strode to his office door, his wand still held at
the ready, and swept out of sight. Harry hesitated for a moment, then
followed.
The screams were indeed coming from the entrance hall; they grew
louder as Harry ran toward the stone steps leading up from the dun-
geons. When he reached the top he found the entrance hall packed.
Students had come flooding out of the Great Hall, where dinner was
still in progress, to see what was going on. Others had crammed them-
selves onto the marble staircase. Harry pushed forward through a knot
of tall Slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a great ring,
some of them looking shocked, others even frightened. Professor
McGonagall was directly opposite Harry on the other side of the hall;
she looked as though what she was watching made her feel faintly
sick.
Professor Trelawney was standing in the middle of the entrance hall
with her wand in one hand and an empty sherry bottle in the other,
looking utterly mad. Her hair was sticking up on end, her glasses were
lopsided so that one eye was magnified more than the other; her in-
numerable shawls and scarves were trailing haphazardly from her
shoulders, giving the impression that she was falling apart at the
seams. Two large trunks lay on the floor beside her, one of them up-
side down; it looked very much as though it had been thrown down
the stairs after her. Professor Trelawney was staring, apparently terri-
fied, at something Harry could not see but that seemed to be standing
at the foot of the stairs.

594
SEEN AND UNFORESEEN
“No!” she shrieked. “NO! This cannot be happening. . . . It cannot
. . . I refuse to accept it!”
“You didn’t realize this was coming?” said a high girlish voice,
sounding callously amused, and Harry, moving slightly to his right,
saw that Trelawney’s terrifying vision was nothing other than Professor
Umbridge. “Incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrow’s
weather, you must surely have realized that your pitiful performance
during my inspections, and lack of any improvement, would make it
inevitable you would be sacked?”
“You c-can’t!” howled Professor Trelawney, tears streaming down
her face from behind her enormous lenses, “you c-can’t sack me! I’ve
b-been here sixteen years! H-Hogwarts is m-my h-home!”
“It was your home,” said Professor Umbridge, and Harry was re-
volted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face as she watched
Professor Trelawney sink, sobbing uncontrollably, onto one of her
trunks, “until an hour ago, when the Minister of Magic countersigned
the order for your dismissal. Now kindly remove yourself from this
hall. You are embarrassing us.”
But she stood and watched, with an expression of gloating enjoy-
ment, as Professor Trelawney shuddered and moaned, rocking back-
ward and forward on her trunk in paroxysms of grief. Harry heard a
sob to his left and looked around. Lavender and Parvati were both cry-
ing silently, their arms around each other. Then he heard footsteps.
Professor McGonagall had broken away from the spectators, marched
straight up to Professor Trelawney and was patting her firmly on the
back while withdrawing a large handkerchief from within her robes.
“There, there, Sibyll . . . Calm down. . . . Blow your nose on this.
. . . It’s not as bad as you think, now. . . . You are not going to have to
leave Hogwarts. . . .”
“Oh really, Professor McGonagall?” said Umbridge in a deadly
voice, taking a few steps forward. “And your authority for that state-
ment is . . . ?”

595
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
“That would be mine,” said a deep voice.
The oak front doors had swung open. Students beside them scut-
tled out of the way as Dumbledore appeared in the entrance. What he
had been doing out in the grounds Harry could not imagine, but
there was something impressive about the sight of him framed in the
doorway against an oddly misty night. Leaving the doors wide behind
him, he strode forward through the circle of onlookers toward the
place where Professor Trelawney sat, tearstained and trembling, upon
her trunk, Professor McGonagall alongside her.
“Yours, Professor Dumbledore?” said Umbridge with a singularly
unpleasant little laugh. “I’m afraid you do not understand the posi-
tion. I have here” — she pulled a parchment scroll from within her
robes — “an Order of Dismissal signed by myself and the Minister of
Magic. Under the terms of Educational Decree Number Twenty-three,
the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts has the power to inspect, place upon
probation, and sack any teacher she — that is to say, I — feel is not
performing up to the standard required by the Ministry of Magic. I
have decided that Professor Trelawney is not up to scratch. I have dis-
missed her.”
To Harry’s very great surprise, Dumbledore continued to smile. He
looked down at Professor Trelawney, who was still sobbing and chok-
ing on her trunk, and said, “You are quite right, of course, Professor
Umbridge. As High Inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my
teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to send them away
from the castle. I am afraid,” he went on, with a courteous little bow,
“that the power to do that still resides with the headmaster, and it is
my wish that Professor Trelawney continue to live at Hogwarts.”
At this, Professor Trelawney gave a wild little laugh in which a hic-
cup was barely hidden.
“No — no, I’ll g-go, Dumbledore! I sh-shall l-leave Hogwarts and
s-seek my fortune elsewhere —”

596
SEEN AND UNFORESEEN
“No,” said Dumbledore sharply. “It is my wish that you remain,
Sibyll.”
He turned to Professor McGonagall.
“Might I ask you to escort Sibyll back upstairs, Professor
McGonagall?”
“Of course,” said McGonagall. “Up you get, Sibyll. . . .”
Professor Sprout came hurrying forward out of the crowd and
grabbed Professor Trelawney’s other arm. Together they guided her
past Umbridge and up the marble stairs. Professor Flitwick went scur-
rying after them, his wand held out before him; he squeaked, “Loco-
motor trunks!” and Professor Trelawney’s luggage rose into the air and
proceeded up the staircase after her, Professor Flitwick bringing up the
rear.
Professor Umbridge was standing stock-still, staring at Dumble-
dore, who continued to smile benignly.
“And what,” she said in a whisper that nevertheless carried all
around the entrance hall, “are you going to do with her once I appoint
a new Divination teacher who needs her lodgings?”
“Oh, that won’t be a problem,” said Dumbledore pleasantly. “You
see, I have already found us a new Divination teacher, and he will pre-
fer lodgings on the ground floor.”
“You’ve found — ?” said Umbridge shrilly. “You’ve found? Might I
remind you, Dumbledore, that under Educational Decree Twenty-
two —”
“— the Ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate if —
and only if — the headmaster is unable to find one,” said Dumble-
dore. “And I am happy to say that on this occasion I have succeeded.
May I introduce you?”
He turned to face the open front doors, through which night mist
was now drifting. Harry heard hooves. There was a shocked murmur
around the hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even farther


backward, some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for
the newcomer.
Through the mist came a face Harry had seen once before on a
dark, dangerous night in the Forbidden Forest: white-blond hair and
astonishingly blue eyes, the head and torso of a man joined to the
palomino body of a horse.
“This is Firenze,” said Dumbledore happily to a thunderstruck
Umbridge. “I think you’ll find him suitable.”

THE CENTAUR AND
THE SNEAK
I
’ll bet you wish you hadn’t given up Divination now, don’t you,
Hermione?” asked Parvati, smirking.
It was breakfast time a few days after the sacking of Professor
Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and
examining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their
first lesson with Firenze that morning.
“Not really,” said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the
Daily Prophet. “I’ve never really liked horses.”
She turned a page of the newspaper, scanning its columns.
“He’s not a horse, he’s a centaur!” said Lavender, sounding shocked.
“A gorgeous centaur . . .” sighed Parvati.
“Either way, he’s still got four legs,” said Hermione coolly. “Any-
way, I thought you two were all upset that Trelawney had gone?”
“We are!” Lavender assured her. “We went up to her office to see
her, we took her some daffodils — not the honking ones that Sprout’s
got, nice ones. . . .”
“How is she?” asked Harry.
“Not very good, poor thing,” said Lavender sympathetically. “She

599
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
was crying and saying she’d rather leave the castle forever than stay
here if Umbridge is still here, and I don’t blame her. Umbridge was
horrible to her, wasn’t she?”
“I’ve got a feeling Umbridge has only just started being horrible,”
said Hermione darkly.
“Impossible,” said Ron, who was tucking into a large plate of eggs
and bacon. “She can’t get any worse than she’s been already.”
“You mark my words, she’s going to want revenge on Dumbledore
for appointing a new teacher without consulting her,” said Hermione,
closing the newspaper. “Especially another part-human. You saw the
look on her face when she saw Firenze. . . .”
After breakfast Hermione departed for her Arithmancy class and
Harry and Ron followed Parvati and Lavender into the entrance hall,
heading for Divination.
“Aren’t we going up to North Tower?” asked Ron, looking puzzled,
as Parvati bypassed the marble staircase.
Parvati looked scornfully over her shoulder at him.
“How d’you expect Firenze to climb that ladder? We’re in class-
room eleven now, it was on the notice board yesterday.”
Classroom eleven was situated in the ground-floor corridor leading
off the entrance hall on the opposite side to the Great Hall. Harry
knew it to be one of those classrooms that were never used regularly,
and that it therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or
storeroom. When he entered it right behind Ron, and found him-
self right in the middle of a forest clearing, he was therefore momen-
tarily stunned.
“What the — ?”
The classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were
growing out of it; their leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and
windows, so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft, dappled,
green light. The students who had already arrived were sitting on the
earthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders,

600
THE CENTAUR AND
THE SNEAK
arms wrapped around their knees or folded tightly across their chests,
looking rather nervous. In the middle of the room, where there were
no trees, stood Firenze.
“Harry Potter,” he said, holding out a hand when Harry entered.
“Er — hi,” said Harry, shaking hands with the centaur, who sur-
veyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did
not smile. “Er — good to see you . . .”
“And you,” said the centaur, inclining his white-blond head. “It
was foretold that we would meet again.”
Harry noticed that there was the shadow of a hoof-shaped bruise
on Firenze’s chest. As he turned to join the rest of the class upon the
floor, he saw that they were all looking at him with awe, apparently
deeply impressed that he was on speaking terms with Firenze, whom
they seemed to find intimidating.
When the door was closed and the last student had sat down upon
a tree stump beside the wastepaper basket, Firenze gestured around
the room.
“Professor Dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us,”
said Firenze, when everyone had settled down, “in imitation of my
natural habitat. I would have preferred to teach you in the Forbidden
Forest, which was — until Monday — my home . . . but this is not
possible.”
“Please — er — sir —” said Parvati breathlessly, raising her hand,
“why not? We’ve been in there with Hagrid, we’re not frightened!”
“It is not a question of your bravery,” said Firenze, “but of my po-
sition. I can no longer return to the forest. My herd has banished me.”
“Herd?” said Lavender in a confused voice, and Harry knew she
was thinking of cows. “What — oh!” Comprehension dawned on her
face. “There are more of you?” she said, stunned.
“Did Hagrid breed you, like the thestrals?” asked Dean eagerly.
Firenze turned his head very slowly to face Dean, who seemed to
realize at once that he had said something very offensive.

601
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
“I didn’t — I meant — sorry,” he finished in a hushed voice.
“Centaurs are not the servants or playthings of humans,” said
Firenze quietly. There was a pause, then Parvati raised her hand again.
“Please, sir . . . why have the other centaurs banished you?”
“Because I have agreed to work for Professor Dumbledore,” said
Firenze. “They see this as a betrayal of our kind.”
Harry remembered how, nearly four years ago, the centaur Bane
had shouted at Firenze for allowing Harry to ride to safety upon his
back, calling him a “common mule.” He wondered whether it had
been Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest.
“Let us begin,” said Firenze. He swished his long palomino tail,
raised his hand toward the leafy canopy overhead then lowered it
slowly, and as he did so, the light in the room dimmed, so that they
now seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight, and stars
emerged upon the ceiling. There were oohs and gasps, and Ron said
audibly, “Blimey!”
“Lie back upon the floor,” said Firenze in his calm voice, “and ob-
serve the heavens. Here is written, for those who can see, the fortune
of our races.”
Harry stretched out on his back and gazed upward at the ceiling. A
twinkling red star winked at him from overhead.
“I know that you have learned the names of the planets and their
moons in Astronomy,” said Firenze’s calm voice, “and that you have
mapped the stars’ progress through the heavens. Centaurs have unrav-
eled the mysteries of these movements over centuries. Our findings
teach us that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us. . . .”
“Professor Trelawney did Astrology with us!” said Parvati excitedly,
raising her hand in front of her so that it stuck up in the air as she lay
on her back. “Mars causes accidents and burns and things like that,
and when it makes an angle to Saturn, like now” — she drew a right
angle in the air above her — “that means that people need to be extra
careful when handling hot things —”

602
THE CENTAUR AND
THE SNEAK
“That,” said Firenze calmly, “is human nonsense.”
Parvati’s hand fell limply to her side.
“Trivial hurts, tiny human accidents,” said Firenze, as his hooves
thudded over the mossy floor. “These are of no more significance than
the scurryings of ants to the wide universe, and are unaffected by
planetary movements.”
“Professor Trelawney —” began Parvati, in a hurt and indignant
voice.
“— is a human,” said Firenze simply. “And is therefore blinkered
and fettered by the limitations of your kind.”
Harry turned his head very slightly to look at Parvati. She looked very
offended, as did several of the people surrounding her.
“Sibyll Trelawney may have Seen, I do not know,” continued
Firenze, and Harry heard the swishing of his tail again as he walked up
and down before them, “but she wastes her time, in the main, on the
self-flattering nonsense humans call fortune-telling. I, however, am
here to explain the wisdom of centaurs, which is impersonal and im-
partial. We watch the skies for the great tides of evil or change that are
sometimes marked there. It may take ten years to be sure of what we
are seeing.”
Firenze pointed to the red star directly above Harry.
“In the past decade, the indications have been that Wizard-kind is
living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars.
Mars, bringer of battle, shines brightly above us, suggesting that the
fight must break out again soon. How soon, centaurs may attempt to
divine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves, by the observation
of fume and flame. . . .”
It was the most unusual lesson Harry had ever attended. They did
indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor, and
Firenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pun-
gent fumes, but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of
them could see any of the signs he described, telling them that humans

603
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
were hardly ever good at this, that it took centaurs years and years to
become competent, and finished by telling them that it was foolish to
put too much faith in such things anyway, because even centaurs
sometimes read them wrongly. He was nothing like any human
teacher Harry had ever had. His priority did not seem to be to teach
them what he knew, but rather to impress upon them that nothing,
not even centaurs’ knowledge, was foolproof.
“He’s not very definite on anything, is he?” said Ron in a low voice,
as they put out their mallowsweet fire. “I mean, I could do with a few
more details about this war we’re about to have, couldn’t you?”
The bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone
jumped; Harry had completely forgotten that they were still inside the
castle, quite convinced that he was really in the forest. The class filed
out, looking slightly perplexed; Harry and Ron were on the point of
following them when Firenze called, “Harry Potter, a word, please.”
Harry turned. The centaur advanced a little toward him. Ron
hesitated.
“You may stay,” Firenze told him. “But close the door, please.”
Ron hastened to obey.
“Harry Potter, you are a friend of Hagrid’s, are you not?” said the
centaur.
“Yes,” said Harry.
“Then give him a warning from me. His attempt is not working.
He would do better to abandon it.”
“His attempt is not working?” Harry repeated blankly.
“And he would do better to abandon it,” said Firenze, nodding. “I
would warn Hagrid myself, but I am banished — it would be unwise
for me to go too near the forest now — Hagrid has troubles enough,
without a centaurs’ battle.”
“But — what’s Hagrid attempting to do?” said Harry nervously.
Firenze looked at Harry impassively.
“Hagrid has recently rendered me a great service,” said Firenze,

604
THE CENTAUR AND
THE SNEAK
“and he has long since earned my respect for the care he shows all liv-
ing creatures. I shall not betray his secret. But he must be brought to
his senses. The attempt is not working. Tell him, Harry Potter. Good
day to you.”
The happiness Harry had felt in the aftermath of The Quibbler inter-
view had long since evaporated. As a dull March blurred into a squally
April, his life seemed to have become one long series of worries and
problems again.
Umbridge had continued attending all Care of Magical Creatures
lessons, so it had been very difficult to deliver Firenze’s warning to Ha-
grid. At last Harry had managed it by pretending he had lost his copy
of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and doubling back after
class one day. When he passed on Firenze’s message, Hagrid gazed at
him for a moment through his puffy, blackened eyes, apparently taken
aback. Then he seemed to pull himself together.
“Nice bloke, Firenze,” he said gruffly, “but he don’ know what he’s
talkin’ abou’ on this. The attemp’s comin’ on fine.”
“Hagrid, what’re you up to?” asked Harry seriously. “Because
you’ve got to be careful, Umbridge has already sacked Trelawney and
if you ask me, she’s on a roll. If you’re doing anything you shouldn’t
be —”
“There’s things more importan’ than keepin’ a job,” said Hagrid,
though his hands shook slightly as he said this and a basin full of knarl
droppings crashed to the floor. “Don’ worry abou’ me, Harry, jus’ get
along now, there’s a good lad. . . .”
Harry had no choice but to leave Hagrid mopping up the dung all
over his floor, but he felt thoroughly dispirited as he trudged back up
to the castle.
Meanwhile, as the teachers and Hermione persisted in reminding
them, the O.W.L.s were drawing ever nearer. All the fifth years were
suffering from stress to some degree, but Hannah Abbott became the

605
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
first to receive a Calming Draught from Madam Pomfrey after she
burst into tears during Herbology and sobbed that she was too stupid
to take exams and wanted to leave school now.
If it had not been for the D.A. lessons, Harry thought he would
have been extremely unhappy. He sometimes felt that he was living
for the hours he spent in the Room of Requirement, working hard but
thoroughly enjoying himself at the same time, swelling with pride as
he looked around at his fellow D.A. members and saw how far they
had come. Indeed, Harry sometimes wondered how Umbridge was
going to react when all the members of the D.A. received “Outstand-
ing” in their Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L.s.
They had finally started work on Patronuses, which everybody had
been very keen to practice, though as Harry kept reminding them,
producing a Patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when
they were not under threat was very different to producing it when
confronted by something like a dementor.
“Oh, don’t be such a killjoy,” said Cho brightly, watching her sil-
very swan-shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement
during their last lesson before Easter. “They’re so pretty!”
“They’re not supposed to be pretty, they’re supposed to protect
you,” said Harry patiently. “What we really need is a boggart or some-
thing; that’s how I learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while the bog-
gart was pretending to be a dementor —”
“But that would be really scary!” said Lavender, who was shooting
puffs of silver vapor out of the end of her wand. “And I still —
can’t — do it!” she added angrily.
Neville was having trouble too. His face was screwed up in concen-
tration, but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand tip.
“You’ve got to think of something happy,” Harry reminded him.
“I’m trying,” said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard his
round face was actually shining with sweat.
“Harry, I think I’m doing it!” yelled Seamus, who had been

606
THE CENTAUR AND
THE SNEAK
brought along to his first ever D.A. meeting by Dean. “Look — ah —
it’s gone. . . . But it was definitely something hairy, Harry!”
Hermione’s Patronus, a shining silver otter, was gamboling around
her.
“They are sort of nice, aren’t they?” she said, looking at it fondly.
The door of the Room of Requirement opened and then closed
again; Harry looked around to see who had entered, but there did not
seem to be anybody there. It was a few moments before he realized
that the people close to the door had fallen silent. Next thing he knew,
something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee. He
looked down and saw, to his very great astonishment, Dobby the
house-elf peering up at him from beneath his usual eight hats.
“Hi, Dobby!” he said. “What are you — what’s wrong?”
For the elf ’s eyes were wide with terror and he was shaking. The
members of the D.A. closest to Harry had fallen silent now: Every-
body in the room was watching Dobby. The few Patronuses people
had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist, leaving the room
looking much darker than before.
“Harry Potter, sir . . .” squeaked the elf, trembling from head to
foot, “Harry Potter, sir . . . Dobby has come to warn you . . . but the
house-elves have been warned not to tell . . .”
He ran headfirst at the wall: Harry, who had some experience of
Dobby’s habits of self-punishment, made to seize him, but Dobby
merely bounced off the stone, cushioned by his eight hats. Hermione
and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy.
“What’s happened, Dobby?” Harry asked, grabbing the elf ’s tiny
arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek
to hurt himself.
“Harry Potter . . . she . . . she . . .”
Dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist: Harry seized
that too.
“Who’s ‘she,’ Dobby?”

607
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
But he thought he knew — surely only one “she” could induce
such fear in Dobby? The elf looked up at him, slightly cross-eyed, and
mouthed wordlessly.
“Umbridge?” asked Harry, horrified.
Dobby nodded, then tried to bang his head off Harry’s knees;
Harry held him at bay.
“What about her? Dobby — she hasn’t found out about this —
about us — about the D.A.?”
He read the answer in the elf ’s stricken face. His hands held fast by
Harry, the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor.
“Is she coming?” Harry asked quietly.
Dobby let out a howl, and began beating his bare feet hard on the
floor. “Yes, Harry Potter, yes!”
Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terri-
fied people gazing at the thrashing elf.
“WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?” Harry bellowed. “RUN!”
They all pelted toward the exit at once, forming a scrum at the
door, then people burst through; Harry could hear them sprinting
along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make
it all the way to their dormitories. It was only ten to nine, if they just
took refuge in the library or the Owlery, which were both nearer —
“Harry, come on!” shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot
of people now fighting to get out.
He scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do himself seri-
ous injury, and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the
queue.
“Dobby — this is an order — get back down to the kitchen with
the other elves, and if she asks you whether you warned me, lie and say
no!” said Harry. “And I forbid you to hurt yourself!” he added, drop-
ping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slamming the
door behind him.
“Thank you, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, and he streaked off.

608
THE CENTAUR AND
THE SNEAK
Harry glanced left and right, the others were all moving so fast that he
caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor be-
fore they vanished. He started to run right; there was a boys’ bath-
room up ahead, he could pretend he’d been in there all the time if he
could just reach it —
“AAARGH!”
Something caught him around the ankles and he fell spectacularly,
skidding along on his front for six feet before coming to a halt. Some-
one behind him was laughing. He rolled over onto his back and saw
Malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragon-shaped vase.
“Trip Jinx, Potter!” he said. “Hey, Professor — PROFESSOR! I’ve
got one!”
Umbridge came bustling around the far corner, breathless but
wearing a delighted smile.
“It’s him!” she said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor. “Ex-
cellent, Draco, excellent, oh, very good — fifty points to Slytherin! I’ll
take him from here. . . . Stand up, Potter!”
Harry got to his feet, glaring at the pair of them. He had never seen
Umbridge looking so happy. She seized his arm in a vicelike grip and
turned, beaming broadly, to Malfoy. “You hop along and see if you
can round up anymore of them, Draco,” she said. “Tell the others to
look in the library — anybody out of breath — check the bathrooms,
Miss Parkinson can do the girls’ ones — off you go — and you,” she
added in her softest, most dangerous voice, as Malfoy walked away.
“You can come with me to the headmaster’s office, Potter.”
They were at the stone gargoyle within minutes. Harry wondered
how many of the others had been caught. He thought of Ron — Mrs.
Weasley would kill him — and of how Hermione would feel if she
was expelled before she could take her O.W.L.s. And it had been Sea-
mus’s very first meeting . . . and Neville had been getting so good. . . .
“Fizzing Whizbee,” sang Umbridge, and the stone gargoyle jumped
aside, the wall behind split open, and they ascended the moving stone

609
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
staircase. They reached the polished door with the griffin knocker, but
Umbridge did not bother to knock, she strode straight inside, still
holding tight to Harry.
The office was full of people. Dumbledore was sitting behind his
desk, his expression serene, the tips of his long fingers together. Pro-
fessor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him, her face extremely tense.
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, was rocking backward and for-
ward on his toes beside the fire, apparently immensely pleased with
the situation. Kingsley Shacklebolt and a tough-looking wizard Harry
did not recognize with very short, wiry hair were positioned on either
side of the door like guards, and the freckled, bespectacled form of
Percy Weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall, a quill and a heavy
scroll of parchment in his hands, apparently poised to take notes.
The portraits of old headmasters and mistresses were not sham-
ming sleep tonight. All of them were watching what was happening
below, alert and serious. As Harry entered, a few flitted into neigh-
boring frames and whispered urgently into their neighbors’ ears.
Harry pulled himself free of Umbridge’s grasp as the door swung
shut behind them. Cornelius Fudge was glaring at him with a kind of
vicious satisfaction upon his face.
“Well,” he said. “Well, well, well . . .”
Harry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster. His heart
drummed madly inside him, but his brain was oddly cool and clear.
“He was heading back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Umbridge. There
was an indecent excitement in her voice, the same callous pleasure
Harry had heard as she watched Professor Trelawney dissolving with
misery in the entrance hall. “The Malfoy boy cornered him.”
“Did he, did he?” said Fudge appreciatively. “I must remember to
tell Lucius. Well, Potter . . . I expect you know why you are here?”
Harry fully intended to respond with a defiant “yes”: His mouth
had opened and the word was half formed when he caught sight of

610
THE CENTAUR AND
THE SNEAK
Dumbledore’s face. Dumbledore was not looking directly at Harry;
his eyes were fixed upon a point just over his shoulder, but as Harry
stared at him, he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side.
Harry changed direction mid-word.
“Yeh — no.”
“I beg your pardon?” said Fudge.
“No,” said Harry, firmly.
“You don’t know why you are here?”
“No, I don’t,” said Harry.
Fudge looked incredulously from Harry to Professor Umbridge;
Harry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another
quick look at Dumbledore, who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods
and the shadow of a wink.
“So you have no idea,” said Fudge in a voice positively sagging with
sarcasm, “why Professor Umbridge has brought you to this office? You
are not aware that you have broken any school rules?”
“School rules?” said Harry. “No.”
“Or Ministry decrees?” amended Fudge angrily.
“Not that I’m aware of,” said Harry blandly.
His heart was still hammering very fast. It was almost worth telling
these lies to watch Fudge’s blood pressure rising, but he could not see
how on earth he would get away with them. If somebody had tipped
off Umbridge about the D.A. then he, the leader, might as well be
packing his trunk right now.
“So it’s news to you, is it,” said Fudge, his voice now thick with
anger, “that an illegal student organization has been discovered within
this school?”
“Yes, it is,” said Harry, hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent
surprise onto his face.
“I think, Minister,” said Umbridge silkily from beside him, “we
might make better progress if I fetch our informant.”

611
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
“Yes, yes, do,” said Fudge, nodding, and he glanced maliciously at
Dumbledore as Umbridge left the room. “There’s nothing like a good
witness, is there, Dumbledore?”
“Nothing at all, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore gravely, inclining his
head.
There was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at
each other, then Harry heard the door open behind him. Umbridge
moved past him into the room, gripping by the shoulder Cho’s curly-
haired friend Marietta, who was hiding her face in her hands.
“Don’t be scared, dear, don’t be frightened,” said Professor Um-
bridge softly, patting her on the back, “it’s quite all right, now. You
have done the right thing. The minister is very pleased with you. He’ll
be telling your mother what a good girl you’ve been. Marietta’s mother,
Minister,” she added, looking up at Fudge, “is Madam Edgecombe
from the Department of Magical Transportation. Floo Network of-
fice — she’s been helping us police the Hogwarts fires, you know.”
“Jolly good, jolly good!” said Fudge heartily. “Like mother, like
daughter, eh? Well, come on, now, dear, look up, don’t be shy, let’s
hear what you’ve got to — galloping gargoyles!”
As Marietta raised her head, Fudge leapt backward in shock, nearly
landing himself in the fire. He cursed and stamped on the hem of his
cloak, which had started to smoke, and Marietta gave a wail and
pulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes, but not before the
whole room had seen that her face was horribly disfigured by a series
of close-set purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks
to form the word “SNEAK.”
“Never mind the spots now, dear,” said Umbridge impatiently, “just
take your robes away from your mouth and tell the Minister —”
But Marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head
frantically.
“Oh, very well, you silly girl, I’ll tell him,” snapped Umbridge. She
hitched her sickly smile back onto her face and said, “Well, Minister,

612
THE CENTAUR AND
THE SNEAK
Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this
evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me. She
said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor, some-
times known as the Room of Requirement, I would find out some-
thing to my advantage. I questioned her a little further and she
admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there. Unfortu-
nately at that point this hex,” she waved impatiently at Marietta’s con-
cealed face, “came into operation and upon catching sight of her face
in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more.”
“Well, now,” said Fudge, fixing Marietta with what he evidently
imagined was a kind and fatherly look. “It is very brave of you, my
dear, coming to tell Professor Umbridge, you did exactly the right
thing. Now, will you tell me what happened at this meeting? What
was its purpose? Who was there?”
But Marietta would not speak. She merely shook her head again,
her eyes wide and fearful.
“Haven’t we got a counterjinx for this?” Fudge asked Umbridge
impatiently, gesturing at Marietta’s face. “So she can speak freely?”
“I have not yet managed to find one,” Umbridge admitted grudg-
ingly, and Harry felt a surge of pride in Hermione’s jinxing ability.
“But it doesn’t matter if she won’t speak, I can take up the story from
here.
“You will remember, Minister, that I sent you a report back in Oc-
tober that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog’s
Head in Hogsmeade —”
“And what is your evidence for that?” cut in Professor McGonagall.
“I have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who hap-
pened to be in the bar at the time. He was heavily bandaged, it is true,
but his hearing was quite unimpaired,” said Umbridge smugly. “He
heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to re-
port to me —”
“Oh, so that’s why he wasn’t prosecuted for setting up all those

613
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
regurgitating toilets!” said Professor McGonagall, raising her eye-
brows. “What an interesting insight into our justice system!”
“Blatant corruption!” roared the portrait of the corpulent, red-
nosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore’s desk. “The Ministry
did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not!”
“Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,” said Dumbledore softly.
“The purpose of Potter’s meeting with these students,” continued
Professor Umbridge, “was to persuade them to join an illegal society,
whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are
inappropriate for school-age —”
“I think you’ll find you’re wrong there, Dolores,” said Dumbledore
quietly, peering at her over the half-moon spectacles perched halfway
down his crooked nose.
Harry stared at him. He could not see how Dumbledore was going
to talk him out of this one; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard
every word he said in the Hog’s Head there was simply no escaping it.
“Oho!” said Fudge, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet
again. “Yes, do let’s hear the latest cock-and-bull story designed to pull
Potter out of trouble! Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on — Willy
Widdershins was lying, was he? Or was it Potter’s identical twin in the
Hog’s Head that day? Or is there the usual simple explanation involv-
ing a reversal of time, a dead man coming back to life, and a couple of
invisible dementors?”
Percy Weasley let out a hearty laugh.
“Oh, very good, Minister, very good!”
Harry could have kicked him. Then he saw, to his astonishment,
that Dumbledore was smiling gently too.
“Cornelius, I do not deny — and nor, I am sure, does Harry —
that he was in the Hog’s Head that day, nor that he was trying to re-
cruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group. I am merely
pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group
was, at that time, illegal. If you remember, the Ministry decree ban-

614
THE CENTAUR AND
THE SNEAK
ning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after
Harry’s Hogsmeade meeting, so he was not breaking any rules in the
Hog’s Head at all.”
Percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something
very heavy. Fudge remained motionless in mid-bounce, his mouth
hanging open.
Umbridge recovered first.
“That’s all very fine, Headmaster,” she said, smiling sweetly. “But
we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational
Decree Number Twenty-four. If the first meeting was not illegal, all
those that have happened since most certainly are.”
“Well,” said Dumbledore, surveying her with polite interest over
the top of his interlocked fingers, “they certainly would be, if they had
continued after the decree came into effect. Do you have any evidence
that these meetings continued?”
As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather
thought Kingsley whispered something. He could have sworn too that
he felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a
draft or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there.
“Evidence?” repeated Umbridge with that horrible wide toadlike
smile. “Have you not been listening, Dumbledore? Why do you think
Miss Edgecombe is here?”
“Oh, can she tell us about six months’ worth of meetings?” said
Dumbledore, raising his eyebrows. “I was under the impression that
she was merely reporting a meeting tonight.”
“Miss Edgecombe,” said Umbridge at once, “tell us how long these
meetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your
head, I’m sure that won’t make the spots worse. Have they been hap-
pening regularly over the last six months?”
Harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach. This was it, they
had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even Dumbledore would
be able to shift aside. . . .

615
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
“Just nod or shake your head, dear,” Umbridge said coaxingly to
Marietta. “Come on, now, that won’t activate the jinx further. . . .”
Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta’s face. Only
her eyes were visible between the pulled up robes and her curly fringe.
Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight, but her eyes looked oddly blank.
And then — to Harry’s utter amazement — Marietta shook her head.
Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge and then back at Marietta.
“I don’t think you understood the question, did you, dear? I’m ask-
ing whether you’ve been going to these meetings for the past six
months? You have, haven’t you?”
Again, Marietta shook her head.
“What do you mean by shaking your head, dear?” said Umbridge
in a testy voice.
“I would have thought her meaning was quite clear,” said Professor
McGonagall harshly. “There have been no secret meetings for the past
six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?”
Marietta nodded.
“But there was a meeting tonight!” said Umbridge furiously.
“There was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the
Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter
organized it, Potter — why are you shaking your head, girl ?”
“Well, usually when a person shakes their head,” said McGonagall
coldly, “they mean ‘no.’ So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of
sign language as yet unknown to humans —”
Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her around to face her,
and began shaking her very hard. A split second later Dumbledore was
on his feet, his wand raised. Kingsley started forward and Umbridge
leapt back from Marietta, waving her hands in the air as though they
had been burned.
“I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores,” said
Dumbledore, and for the first time, he looked angry.
“You want to calm yourself, Madam Umbridge,” said Kingsley in

616
THE CENTAUR AND
THE SNEAK
his deep, slow voice. “You don’t want to get yourself into trouble
now.”
“No,” said Umbridge breathlessly, glancing up at the towering fig-
ure of Kingsley. “I mean, yes — you’re right, Shacklebolt — I — I
forgot myself.”
Marietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released her.
She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge’s sudden attack, nor re-
lieved by her release. She was still clutching her robe up to her oddly
blank eyes, staring straight ahead of her. A sudden suspicion con-
nected to Kingsley’s whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him
sprang into Harry’s mind.
“Dolores,” said Fudge, with the air of trying to settle something
once and for all, “the meeting tonight — the one we know definitely
happened —”
“Yes,” said Umbridge, pulling herself together, “yes . . . well, Miss
Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh
floor, accompanied by certain trustworthy students, so as to catch
those in the meeting red-handed. It appears that they were forewarned
of my arrival, however, because when we reached the seventh floor
they were running in every direction. It does not matter, however. I
have all their names here, Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of Re-
quirement for me to see if they had left anything behind. . . . We
needed evidence and the room provided . . .”
And to Harry’s horror, she withdrew from her pocket the list of
names that had been pinned upon the Room of Requirement’s wall
and handed it to Fudge.
“The moment I saw Potter’s name on the list, I knew what we were
dealing with,” she said softly.
“Excellent,” said Fudge, a smile spreading across his face. “Excel-
lent, Dolores. And . . . by thunder . . .”
He looked up at Dumbledore, who was still standing beside Mari-
etta, his wand held loosely in his hand.

617
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
“See what they’ve named themselves?” said Fudge quietly. “Dum-
bledore’s Army.”
Dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from
Fudge. He gazed at the heading scribbled by Hermione months be-
fore and for a moment seemed unable to speak. Then he looked up,
smiling.
“Well, the game is up,” he said simply. “Would you like a written
confession from me, Cornelius — or will a statement before these
witnesses suffice?”
Harry saw McGonagall and Kingsley look at each other. There was
fear in both faces. He did not understand what was going on, and nei-
ther, apparently, did Fudge.
“Statement?” said Fudge slowly. “What — I don’t — ?”
“Dumbledore’s Army, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, still smiling as
he waved the list of names before Fudge’s face. “Not Potter’s Army.
Dumbledore’s Army.”
“But — but —”
Understanding blazed suddenly in Fudge’s face. He took a horrified
step backward, yelped, and jumped out of the fire again.
“You?” he whispered, stamping again on his smoldering cloak.
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore pleasantly.
“You organized this?”
“I did,” said Dumbledore.
“You recruited these students for — for your army?”
“Tonight was supposed to be the first meeting,” said Dumbledore,
nodding. “Merely to see whether they would be interested in joining
me. I see now that it was a mistake to invite Miss Edgecombe, of
course.”
Marietta nodded. Fudge looked from her to Dumbledore, his chest
swelling.
“Then you have been plotting against me!” he yelled.
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore cheerfully.

618
THE CENTAUR AND
THE SNEAK
“NO!” shouted Harry.
Kingsley flashed a look of warning at him, McGonagall widened
her eyes threateningly, but it had suddenly dawned upon Harry what
Dumbledore was about to do, and he could not let it happen.
“No — Professor Dumbledore!”
“Be quiet, Harry, or I am afraid you will have to leave my office,”
said Dumbledore calmly.
“Yes, shut up, Potter!” barked Fudge, who was still ogling Dumble-
dore with a kind of horrified delight. “Well, well, well — I came here
tonight expecting to expel Potter and instead —”
“Instead you get to arrest me,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It’s like
losing a Knut and finding a Galleon, isn’t it?”
“Weasley!” cried Fudge, now positively quivering with delight,
“Weasley, have you written it all down, everything he’s said, his con-
fession, have you got it?”
“Yes, sir, I think so, sir!” said Percy eagerly, whose nose was splat-
tered with ink from the speed of his note-taking.
“The bit about how he’s been trying to build up an army against
the Ministry, how he’s been working to destabilize me?”
“Yes, sir, I’ve got it, yes!” said Percy, scanning his notes joyfully.
“Very well, then,” said Fudge, now radiant with glee. “Duplicate
your notes, Weasley, and send a copy to the Daily Prophet at once. If
we send a fast owl we should make the morning edition!” Percy
dashed from the room, slamming the door behind him, and Fudge
turned back to Dumbledore. “You will now be escorted back to the
Ministry, where you will be formally charged and then sent to Azka-
ban to await trial!”
“Ah,” said Dumbledore gently, “yes. Yes, I thought we might hit
that little snag.”
“Snag?” said Fudge, his voice still vibrating with joy. “I see no snag,
Dumbledore!”
“Well,” said Dumbledore apologetically, “I’m afraid I do.”

“Oh really?”
“Well — it’s just that you seem to be laboring under the delusion
that I am going to — what is the phrase? ‘Come quietly’ I am afraid I
am not going to come quietly at all, Cornelius. I have absolutely no
intention of being sent to Azkaban. I could break out, of course —
but what a waste of time, and frankly, I can think of a whole host of
things I would rather be doing.”
Umbridge’s face was growing steadily redder, she looked as though
she was being filled with boiling water. Fudge stared at Dumbledore
with a very silly expression on his face, as though he had just been
stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had hap-
pened. He made a small choking noise and then looked around at
Kingsley and the man with short gray hair, who alone of everyone in
the room had remained entirely silent so far. The latter gave Fudge a
reassuring nod and moved forward a little, away from the wall. Harry
saw his hand drift, almost casually, toward his pocket.
“Don’t be silly, Dawlish,” said Dumbledore kindly. “I’m sure you
are an excellent Auror, I seem to remember that you achieved ‘Out-
standing’ in all your N.E.W.T.s, but if you attempt to — er — ‘bring
me in’ by force, I will have to hurt you.”
The man called Dawlish blinked, looking rather foolish. He looked
toward Fudge again, but this time seemed to be hoping for a clue as to
what to do next.
“So,” sneered Fudge, recovering himself, “you intend to take on
Dawlish, Shacklebolt, Dolores, and myself single-handed, do you,
Dumbledore?”
“Merlin’s beard, no,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “Not unless you
are foolish enough to force me to.”
“He will not be single-handed!” said Professor McGonagall loudly,
plunging her hand inside her robes.
“Oh yes he will, Minerva!” said Dumbledore sharply. “Hogwarts
needs you!”


THE CENTAUR AND
THE SNEAK
“Enough of this rubbish!” said Fudge, pulling out his own wand.
“Dawlish! Shacklebolt! Take him!”
A streak of silver light flashed around the room. There was a bang
like a gunshot, and the floor trembled. A hand grabbed the scruff of
Harry’s neck and forced him down on the floor as a second silver flash
went off — several of the portraits yelled, Fawkes screeched, and a
cloud of dust filled the air. Coughing in the dust, Harry saw a dark fig-
ure fall to the ground with a crash in front of him. There was a shriek
and a thud and somebody cried, “No!” Then the sound of breaking
glass, frantically scuffling footsteps, a groan — and silence.
Harry struggled around to see who was half-strangling him and saw
Professor McGonagall crouched beside him. She had forced both him
and Marietta out of harm’s way. Dust was still floating gently down
through the air onto them. Panting slightly, Harry saw a very tall fig-
ure moving toward them.
“Are you all right?” said Dumbledore.
“Yes!” said Professor McGonagall, getting up and dragging Harry
and Marietta with her.
The dust was clearing. The wreckage of the office loomed into
view: Dumbledore’s desk had been overturned, all of the spindly ta-
bles had been knocked to the floor, their silver instruments in pieces.
Fudge, Umbridge, Kingsley, and Dawlish lay motionless on the floor.
Fawkes the phoenix soared in wide circles above them, singing softly.
“Unfortunately, I had to hex Kingsley too, or it would have looked
very suspicious,” said Dumbledore in a low voice. “He was remark-
ably quick on the uptake, modifying Miss Edgecombe’s memory like
that while everyone was looking the other way — thank him for me,
won’t you, Minerva?
“Now, they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do
not know that we had time to communicate — you must act as though
no time has passed, as though they were merely knocked to the
ground, they will not remember —”


CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
“Where will you go, Dumbledore?” whispered Professor McGona-
gall. “Grimmauld Place?”
“Oh no,” said Dumbledore with a grim smile. “I am not leaving to
go into hiding. Fudge will soon wish he’d never dislodged me from
Hogwarts, I promise you. . . .”
“Professor Dumbledore . . .” Harry began.
He did not know what to say first: how sorry he was that he had
started the D.A. in the first place and caused all this trouble, or how
terrible he felt that Dumbledore was leaving to save him from expul-
sion? But Dumbledore cut him off before he could say another word.
“Listen to me, Harry,” he said urgently, “you must study Occlu-
mency as hard as you can, do you understand me? Do everything Pro-
fessor Snape tells you and practice it particularly every night before
sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dreams — you will
understand why soon enough, but you must promise me —”
The man called Dawlish was stirring. Dumbledore seized Harry’s
wrist.
“Remember — close your mind —”
But as Dumbledore’s fingers closed over Harry’s skin, a pain shot
through the scar on his forehead, and he felt again that terrible, snake-
like longing to strike Dumbledore, to bite him, to hurt him —
“— you will understand,” whispered Dumbledore.
Fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him. Dumbledore
released Harry, raised his hand, and grasped the phoenix’s long golden
tail. There was a flash of fire and the pair of them had gone.
“Where is he?” yelled Fudge, pushing himself up from the ground.
“Where is he?”
“I don’t know!” shouted Kingsley, also leaping to his feet.
“Well, he can’t have Disapparated!” cried Umbridge. “You can’t in-
side this school —”
“The stairs!” cried Dawlish, and he flung himself upon the door,
wrenched it open, and disappeared, followed closely by Kingsley and

622
THE CENTAUR AND
THE SNEAK
Umbridge. Fudge hesitated, then got to his feet slowly, brushing dust
from his front. There was a long and painful silence.
“Well, Minerva,” said Fudge nastily, straightening his torn shirt-
sleeve, “I’m afraid this is the end of your friend Dumbledore.”
“You think so, do you?” said Professor McGonagall scornfully.
Fudge seemed not to hear her. He was looking around at the
wrecked office. A few of the portraits hissed at him; one or two even
made rude hand gestures.
“You’d better get those two off to bed,” said Fudge, looking back at
Professor McGonagall with a dismissive nod toward Harry and
Marietta.
She said nothing, but marched Harry and Marietta to the door. As
it swung closed behind them, Harry heard Phineas Nigellus’s voice.
“You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts
. . . but you cannot deny he’s got style. . . .”

— by order of —
The Ministry of Magic
Dolores Jane Umbridge (High Inquisitor) has replaced Al-
bus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry.
The above is in accordance with
Educational Decree Number Twenty-eight.
Signed:
minister of magic
The notices had gone up all over the school overnight, but they did
not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know

624
SNAPE’S WORST
MEMORY
that Dumbledore had overcome two Aurors, the High Inquisitor, the
Minister of Magic, and his Junior Assistant to escape. No matter
where Harry went within the castle next day, the sole topic of conver-
sation was Dumbledore’s flight, and though some of the details might
have gone awry in the retelling (Harry overheard one second-year girl
assuring another that Fudge was now lying in St. Mungo’s with a
pumpkin for a head), it was surprising how accurate the rest of their
information was. Everybody seemed aware, for instance, that Harry
and Marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in
Dumbledore’s office, and as Marietta was now in the hospital wing,
Harry found himself besieged with requests to give a firsthand ac-
count wherever he went.
“Dumbledore will be back before long,” said Ernie Macmillan con-
fidently on the way back from Herbology after listening intently to
Harry’s story. “They couldn’t keep him away in our second year and
they won’t be able to this time. The Fat Friar told me . . .” He dropped
his voice conspiratorially, so that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to
lean closer to him to hear, “. . . that Umbridge tried to get back into his
office last night after they’d searched the castle and grounds for him.
Couldn’t get past the gargoyle. The Head’s office has sealed itself against
her.” Ernie smirked. “Apparently she had a right little tantrum. . . .”
“Oh, I expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the Head’s
office,” said Hermione viciously, as they walked up the stone steps into
the entrance hall. “Lording it over all the other teachers, the stupid
puffed-up, power-crazy old —”
“Now, do you really want to finish that sentence, Granger?”
Draco Malfoy had slid out from behind the door, followed by
Crabbe and Goyle. His pale, pointed face was alight with malice.
“Afraid I’m going to have to dock a few points from Gryffindor and
Hufflepuff,” he drawled.
“It’s only teachers that can dock points from Houses, Malfoy,” said
Ernie at once.

625
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
“Yeah, we’re prefects too, remember?” snarled Ron.
“I know prefects can’t dock points, Weasel King,” sneered Malfoy;
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered. “But members of the Inquisitorial
Squad —”
“The what?” said Hermione sharply.
“The Inquisitorial Squad, Granger,” said Malfoy, pointing toward a
tiny silver I upon his robes just beneath his prefect’s badge. “A select
group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic, hand-
picked by Professor Umbridge. Anyway, members of the Inquisitorial
Squad do have the power to dock points. . . . So, Granger, I’ll have five
from you for being rude about our new headmistress. . . . Macmillan,
five for contradicting me. . . . Five because I don’t like you, Potter . . .
Weasley, your shirt’s untucked, so I’ll have another five for that. . . . Oh
yeah, I forgot, you’re a Mudblood, Granger, so ten for that. . . .”
Ron pulled out his wand, but Hermione pushed it away, whisper-
ing, “Don’t!”
“Wise move, Granger,” breathed Malfoy. “New Head, new times
. . . Be good now, Potty . . . Weasel King . . .”
He strode away, laughing heartily with Crabbe and Goyle.
“He was bluffing,” said Ernie, looking appalled. “He can’t be al-
lowed to dock points . . . that would be ridiculous. . . . It would com-
pletely undermine the prefect system. . . .”
But Harry, Ron, and Hermione had turned automatically toward
the giant hourglasses set in niches along the wall behind them, which
recorded the House points. Gryffindor and Ravenclaw had been neck
and neck in the lead that morning. Even as they watched, stones flew
upward, reducing the amounts in the lower bulbs. In fact, the only
glass that seemed unchanged was the emerald-filled one of Slytherin.
“Noticed, have you?” said Fred’s voice.
He and George had just come down the marble staircase and joined
Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie in front of the hourglasses.
“Malfoy just docked us all about fifty points,” said Harry furiously,

626
SNAPE’S WORST
MEMORY
as they watched several more stones fly upward from the Gryffindor
hourglass.
“Yeah, Montague tried to do us during break,” said George.
“What do you mean, ‘tried’?” said Ron quickly.
“He never managed to get all the words out,” said Fred, “due to the
fact that we forced him headfirst into that Vanishing Cabinet on the
first floor.”
Hermione looked very shocked.
“But you’ll get into terrible trouble!”
“Not until Montague reappears, and that could take weeks, I
dunno where we sent him,” said Fred coolly. “Anyway . . . we’ve de-
cided we don’t care about getting into trouble anymore.”
“Have you ever?” asked Hermione.
“ ’Course we have,” said George. “Never been expelled, have we?”
“We’ve always known where to draw the line,” said Fred.
“We might have put a toe across it occasionally,” said George.
“But we’ve always stopped short of causing real mayhem,” said
Fred.
“But now?” said Ron tentatively.
“Well, now —” said George.
“— what with Dumbledore gone —” said Fred.
“— we reckon a bit of mayhem —” said George.
“— is exactly what our dear new Head deserves,” said Fred.
“You mustn’t!” whispered Hermione. “You really mustn’t! She’d
love a reason to expel you!”
“You don’t get it, Hermione, do you?” said Fred, smiling at her.
“We don’t care about staying anymore. We’d walk out right now if we
weren’t determined to do our bit for Dumbledore first. So anyway,” he
checked his watch, “phase one is about to begin. I’d get in the Great
Hall for lunch if I were you, that way the teachers will see you can’t
have had anything to do with it.”
“Anything to do with what?” said Hermione anxiously.

627
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
“You’ll see,” said George. “Run along, now.”
Fred and George turned away and disappeared in the swelling
crowd descending the stairs toward lunch. Looking highly discon-
certed, Ernie muttered something about unfinished Transfiguration
homework and scurried away.
“I think we should get out of here, you know,” said Hermione ner-
vously. “Just in case . . .”
“Yeah, all right,” said Ron, and the three of them moved toward the
doors to the Great Hall, but Harry had barely glimpsed today’s ceiling
of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoul-
der and, turning, he found himself almost nose to nose with Filch, the
caretaker. He took several hasty steps backward; Filch was best viewed
at a distance.
“The headmistress would like to see you, Potter,” he leered.
“I didn’t do it,” said Harry stupidly, thinking of whatever Fred and
George were planning. Filch’s jowls wobbled with silent laughter.
“Guilty conscience, eh?” he wheezed. “Follow me. . . .”
Harry glanced back at Ron and Hermione, who were both looking
worried. He shrugged and followed Filch back into the entrance hall,
against the tide of hungry students.
Filch seemed to be in an extremely good mood; he hummed creak-
ily under his breath as they climbed the marble staircase. As they
reached the first landing he said, “Things are changing around here,
Potter.”
“I’ve noticed,” said Harry coldly.
“Yerse . . . I’ve been telling Dumbledore for years and years he’s too
soft with you all,” said Filch, chuckling nastily. “You filthy little beasts
would never have dropped Stinkpellets if you’d known I had it in my
power to whip you raw, would you, now? Nobody would have
thought of throwing Fanged Frisbees down the corridors if I could’ve
strung you up by the ankles in my office, would they? But when Edu-
cational Decree Twenty-nine comes in, Potter, I’ll be allowed to do

628
SNAPE’S WORST
MEMORY
them things. . . . And she’s asked the Minister to sign an order for the
expulsion of Peeves. . . . Oh, things are going to be very different
around here with her in charge. . . .”
Umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get Filch on her
side, Harry thought, and the worst of it was that he would probably
prove an important weapon; his knowledge of the school’s secret pas-
sageways and hiding places was probably second only to the Weasley
twins.
“Here we are,” he said, leering down at Harry as he rapped three
times upon Professor Umbridge’s door and pushed it open. “The Pot-
ter boy to see you, ma’am.”
Umbridge’s office, so very familiar to Harry from his many deten-
tions, was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying
across the front of her desk on which golden letters spelled the word
HEADMISTRESS; also his Firebolt, and Fred’s and George’s Clean-
sweeps, which he saw with a pang were now chained and padlocked to
a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk. Umbridge was sitting be-
hind the desk, busily scribbling upon some of her pink parchment,
but looked up and smiled widely at their entrance.
“Thank you, Argus,” she said sweetly.
“Not at all, ma’am, not at all,” said Filch, bowing as low as his
rheumatism would permit, and exiting backward.
“Sit,” said Umbridge curtly, pointing toward a chair, and Harry sat.
She continued to scribble for a few moments. He watched some of the
foul kittens gamboling around the plates over her head, wondering
what fresh horror she had in store for him.
“Well now,” she said finally, setting down her quill and looking
like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly. “What would you
like to drink?”
“What?” said Harry, quite sure he had misheard her.
“To drink, Mr. Potter,” she said, smiling still more widely. “Tea?
Coffee? Pumpkin juice?”

629
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
As she named each drink, she gave her short wand a wave, and a
cup or glass of it appeared upon her desk.
“Nothing, thank you,” said Harry.
“I wish you to have a drink with me,” she said, her voice becoming
more dangerously sweet. “Choose one.”
“Fine . . . tea then,” said Harry, shrugging.
She got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with her
back to him. She then bustled around the desk with it, smiling in sin-
isterly sweet fashion.
“There,” she said, handing it to him. “Drink it before it gets cold,
won’t you? Well, now, Mr. Potter . . . I thought we ought to have a lit-
tle chat, after the distressing events of last night.”
He said nothing. She settled herself back into her seat and waited.
When several long moments had passed in silence, she said gaily,
“You’re not drinking up!”
He raised the cup to his lips and then, just as suddenly, lowered it.
One of the horrible painted kittens behind Umbridge had great round
blue eyes just like Mad-Eye Moody’s magical one, and it had just oc-
curred to Harry what Mad-Eye would say if he ever heard that Harry
had drunk anything offered by a known enemy.
“What’s the matter?” said Umbridge, who was still watching him.
“Do you want sugar?”
“No,” said Harry.
He raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip,
though keeping his mouth tightly closed. Umbridge’s smile widened.
“Good,” she whispered. “Very good. Now then . . .” She leaned
forward a little. “Where is Albus Dumbledore?”
“No idea,” said Harry promptly.
“Drink up, drink up,” she said, still smiling. “Now, Mr. Potter, let
us not play childish games. I know that you know where he has gone.
You and Dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning.
Consider your position, Mr. Potter. . . .”

630
SNAPE’S WORST
MEMORY
“I don’t know where he is.”
Harry pretended to drink again.
“Very well,” said Umbridge, looking displeased. “In that case, you
will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black.”
Harry’s stomach turned over and his hand holding the teacup
shook so that the cup rattled in its saucer. He tilted the cup to his
mouth with his lips pressed together, so that some of the hot liquid
trickled down onto his robes.
“I don’t know,” he said a little too quickly.
“Mr. Potter,” said Umbridge, “let me remind you that it was I who
almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October. I
know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if I had had any
proof neither of you would be at large today, I promise you. I repeat,
Mr. Potter . . . Where is Sirius Black?”
“No idea,” said Harry loudly. “Haven’t got a clue.”
They stared at each other so long that Harry felt his eyes watering.
Then she stood up.
“Very well, Potter, I will take your word for it this time, but be
warned: The might of the Ministry stands behind me. All channels of
communication in and out of this school are being monitored. A Floo
Network Regulator is keeping watch over every fire in Hogwarts —
except my own, of course. My Inquisitorial Squad is opening and
reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle. And Mr. Filch is
observing all secret passages in and out of the castle. If I find a shred
of evidence . . .”
BOOM!
The very floor of the office shook; Umbridge slipped sideways,
clutching her desk for support, looking shocked.
“What was — ?”
She was gazing toward the door; Harry took the opportunity to
empty his almost full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers.
He could hear people running and screaming several floors below.

631
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
“Back to lunch with you, Potter!” cried Umbridge, raising her
wand and dashing out of the office. Harry gave her a few seconds’ start
then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar was.
It was not difficult to find. One floor down, pandemonium reigned.
Somebody (and Harry had a very shrewd idea who) had set off what
seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks.
Dragons comprised entirely of green-and-gold sparks were soaring
up and down the corridors, emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as
they went. Shocking-pink Catherine wheels five feet in diameter were
whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers. Rockets
with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls.
Sparklers were writing swearwords in midair of their own accord. Fire-
crackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry looked, and in-
stead of burning themselves out, fading from sight, or fizzling to a
halt, these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and
momentum the longer he watched.
Filch and Umbridge were standing, apparently transfixed with hor-
ror, halfway down the stairs. As Harry watched, one of the larger
Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more
room to maneuver; it whirled toward Umbridge and Filch with a sin-
ister wheeeeeeeeee. Both adults yelled with fright and ducked and it
soared straight out of the window behind them and off across the
grounds. Meanwhile, several of the dragons and a large purple bat that
was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end
of the corridor to escape toward the second floor.
“Hurry, Filch, hurry!” shrieked Umbridge. “They’ll be all over the
school unless we do something — Stupefy!”
A jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the
rockets. Instead of freezing in midair, it exploded with such force that
it blasted a hole in a painting of a soppy-looking witch in the middle
of a meadow — she ran for it just in time, reappearing seconds later

632
SNAPE’S WORST
MEMORY
squashed into the painting next door, where a couple of wizards play-
ing cards stood up hastily to make room for her.
“Don’t Stun them, Filch!” shouted Umbridge angrily, for all the
world as though it had been his suggestion.
“Right you are, Headmistress!” wheezed Filch, who was a Squib
and could no more have Stunned the fireworks than swallowed them.
He dashed to a nearby cupboard, pulled out a broom, and began swat-
ting at the fireworks in midair; within seconds the head of the broom
was ablaze.
Harry had seen enough. Laughing, he ducked down low, ran to a
door he knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the
corridor and slipped through it to find Fred and George hiding just
behind it, listening to Umbridge’s and Filch’s yells and quaking with
suppressed mirth.
“Impressive,” Harry said quietly, grinning. “Very impressive . . .
You’ll put Dr. Filibuster out of business, no problem. . . .”
“Cheers,” whispered George, wiping tears of laughter from his face.
“Oh, I hope she tries Vanishing them next. . . . They multiply by ten
every time you try. . . .”
The fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school
that afternoon. Though they caused plenty of disruption, particularly
the firecrackers, the other teachers did not seem to mind them very
much.
“Dear, dear,” said Professor McGonagall sardonically, as one of the
dragons soared around her classroom, emitting loud bangs and exhal-
ing flame. “Miss Brown, would you mind running along to the head-
mistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our
classroom?”
The upshot of it all was that Professor Umbridge spent her first af-
ternoon as headmistress running all over the school answering the
summonses of the other teachers, none of whom seemed able to rid

633
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
their rooms of the fireworks without her. When the final bell rang and
the students were heading back to Gryffindor Tower with their bags,
Harry saw, with immense satisfaction, a disheveled and soot-blackened
Umbridge tottering sweaty-faced from Professor Flitwick’s classroom.
“Thank you so much, Professor!” said Professor Flitwick in his
squeaky little voice. “I could have got rid of the sparklers myself, of
course, but I wasn’t sure whether I had the authority. . . .”
Beaming, he closed his classroom door in her snarling face.
Fred and George were heroes that night in the Gryffindor common
room. Even Hermione fought her way through the excited crowd
around them to congratulate them.
“They were wonderful fireworks,” she said admiringly.
“Thanks,” said George, looking both surprised and pleased.
“Weasleys’ Wildfire Whiz-Bangs. Only thing is, we used our whole
stock, we’re going to have to start again from scratch now. . . .”
“It was worth it, though,” said Fred, who was taking orders from
clamoring Gryffindors. “If you want to add your name to the waiting
list, Hermione, it’s five Galleons for your Basic Blaze box and twenty
for the Deflagration Deluxe. . . .”
Hermione returned to the table where Harry and Ron were sitting
staring at their schoolbags as though hoping their homework might
spring out of it and start doing itself.
“Oh, why don’t we have a night off?” said Hermione brightly, as a
silver-tailed Weasley rocket zoomed past the window. “After all, the
Easter holidays start on Friday, we’ll have plenty of time then. . . .”
“Are you feeling all right?” Ron asked, staring at her in disbelief.
“Now you mention it,” said Hermione happily, “d’you know . . . I
think I’m feeling a bit . . . rebellious.”
Harry could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when
he and Ron went up to bed an hour later, and as he got undressed a
sparkler floated past the tower, still resolutely spelling out the word
POO.

634
SNAPE’S WORST
MEMORY
He got into bed, yawning. With his glasses off, the occasional fire-
work still passing the window became blurred, looking like sparkling
clouds, beautiful and mysterious against the black sky. He turned
onto his side, wondering how Umbridge was feeling about her first
day in Dumbledore’s job, and how Fudge would react when he heard
that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced dis-
ruption. . . . Smiling to himself, he closed his eyes. . . .
The whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed
to be growing more distant . . . or perhaps he, Harry, was simply
speeding away from them. . . .
He had fallen right into the corridor leading to the Department of
Mysteries. He was speeding toward the plain black door. . . . Let it
open. . . . Let it open. . . .
It did. He was inside the circular room lined with doors. . . . He
crossed it, placed his hand upon an identical door, and it swung
inward. . . .
Now he was in a long, rectangular room full of an odd, mechanical
clicking. There were dancing flecks of light on the walls but he did
not pause to investigate. . . . He had to go on. . . .
There was a door at the far end. . . . It too opened at his touch. . . .
And now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church,
full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves, each laden
with small, dusty, spun-glass spheres. . . . Now Harry’s heart was
beating fast with excitement. . . . He knew where to go. . . . He ran
forward, but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous, deserted
room. . . .
There was something in this room he wanted very, very much. . . .
Something he wanted. . . . or somebody else wanted. . . .
His scar was hurting. . . .
BANG! Harry awoke instantly, confused and angry. The dark dor-
mitory was full of the sound of laughter.
“Cool!” said Seamus, who was silhouetted against the window.

635
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
“I think one of those Catherine wheels hit a rocket and it’s like they
mated, come and see!”
Harry heard Ron and Dean scramble out of bed for a better look.
He lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and dis-
appointment washed over him. He felt as though a wonderful treat
had been snatched from him at the very last moment. . . . He had got
so close that time. . . .
Glittering, pink-and-silver winged piglets were now soaring past
the windows of Gryffindor Tower. Harry lay and listened to the ap-
preciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them. His
stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had Occlu-
mency the following evening. . . .
Harry spent the whole of the next day dreading what Snape was going
to say if he found out how much farther into the Department of Mys-
teries he had penetrated during his last dream. With a surge of guilt he
realized that he had not practiced Occlumency once since their last
lesson: There had been too much going on since Dumbledore had
left. He was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even
if he had tried. He doubted, however, whether Snape would accept
that excuse. . . .
He attempted a little last-minute practice during classes that day,
but it was no good, Hermione kept asking him what was wrong
whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emo-
tion and, after all, the best moment to empty his brain was not while
teachers were firing review questions at the class.
Resigned to the worst, he set off for Snape’s office after dinner.
Halfway across the entrance hall, however, Cho came hurrying up to
him.
“Over here,” said Harry, glad of a reason to postpone his meeting
with Snape and beckoning her across to the corner of the entrance hall
where the giant hourglasses stood. Gryffindor’s was now almost

636
SNAPE’S WORST
MEMORY
empty. “Are you okay? Umbridge hasn’t been asking you about the
D.A., has she?”
“Oh no,” said Cho hurriedly. “No, it was only . . . Well, I just
wanted to say . . . Harry, I never dreamed Marietta would tell. . . .”
“Yeah, well,” said Harry moodily. He did feel Cho might have cho-
sen her friends a bit more carefully. It was small consolation that the
last he had heard, Marietta was still up in the hospital wing and
Madam Pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improve-
ment to her pimples.
“She’s a lovely person really,” said Cho. “She just made a
mistake —”
Harry looked at her incredulously.
“A lovely person who made a mistake? She sold us all out, including
you!”
“Well . . . we all got away, didn’t we?” said Cho pleadingly. “You
know, her mum works for the Ministry, it’s really difficult for her —”
“Ron’s dad works for the Ministry too!” Harry said furiously. “And
in case you hadn’t noticed, he hasn’t got ‘sneak’ written across his
face —”
“That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger’s,” said Cho
fiercely. “She should have told us she’d jinxed that list —”
“I think it was a brilliant idea,” said Harry coldly. Cho flushed and
her eyes grew brighter.
“Oh yes, I forgot — of course, if it was darling Hermione’s idea —”
“Don’t start crying again,” said Harry warningly.
“I wasn’t going to!” she shouted.
“Yeah . . . well . . . good,” he said. “I’ve got enough to cope with at
the moment.”
“Go and cope with it then!” she said furiously, turning on her heel
and stalking off.
Fuming, Harry descended the stairs to Snape’s dungeon, and
though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for

637
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
Snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful, he suc-
ceeded in nothing but thinking of a few more good things he should
have said to Cho about Marietta before reaching the dungeon door.
“You’re late, Potter,” said Snape coldly, as Harry closed the door be-
hind him.
Snape was standing with his back to Harry, removing, as usual, cer-
tain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in Dumbledore’s Pen-
sieve. He dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and
turned to face Harry.
“So,” he said. “Have you been practicing?”
“Yes,” Harry lied, looking carefully at one of the legs of Snape’s
desk.
“Well, we’ll soon find out, won’t we?” said Snape smoothly. “Wand
out, Potter.”
Harry moved into his usual position, facing Snape with the desk
between them. His heart was pumping fast with anger at Cho and
anxiety about how much Snape was about to extract from his mind.
“On the count of three then,” said Snape lazily. “One — two —”
Snape’s office door banged open and Draco Malfoy sped in.
“Professor Snape, sir — oh — sorry —”
Malfoy was looking at Snape and Harry in some surprise.
“It’s all right, Draco,” said Snape, lowering his wand. “Potter is here
for a little Remedial Potions.”
Harry had not seen Malfoy look so gleeful since Umbridge had
turned up to inspect Hagrid.
“I didn’t know,” he said, leering at Harry, who knew his face was
burning. He would have given a great deal to be able to shout the
truth at Malfoy — or, even better, to hit him with a good curse.
“Well, Draco, what is it?” asked Snape.
“It’s Professor Umbridge, sir — she needs your help,” said Malfoy.
“They’ve found Montague, sir. He’s turned up jammed inside a toilet
on the fourth floor.”

638
SNAPE’S WORST
MEMORY
“How did he get in there?” demanded Snape.
“I don’t know, sir, he’s a bit confused. . . .”
“Very well, very well — Potter,” said Snape, “we shall resume this
lesson tomorrow evening instead.”
He turned and swept from his office. Malfoy mouthed “Remedial
Potions?” at Harry behind Snape’s back before following him.
Seething, Harry replaced his wand inside his robes and made to
leave the room. At least he had twenty-four more hours in which to
practice; he knew he ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape,
though it was hard that it came at the expense of Malfoy telling the
whole school that he needed Remedial Potions. . . .
He was at the office door when he saw it: a patch of shivering light
dancing on the door frame. He stopped, looking at it, reminded of
something. . . . Then he remembered: It was a little like the lights he
had seen in his dream last night, the lights in the second room he had
walked through on his journey through the Department of Mysteries.
He turned around. The light was coming from the Pensieve sitting
on Snape’s desk. The silver-white contents were ebbing and swirling
within. Snape’s thoughts . . . things he did not want Harry to see if he
broke through Snape’s defenses accidentally. . . .
Harry gazed at the Pensieve, curiosity welling inside him. . . . What
was it that Snape was so keen to hide from Harry?
The silvery lights shivered on the wall. . . . Harry took two steps to-
ward the desk, thinking hard. Could it possibly be information about
the Department of Mysteries that Snape was determined to keep from
him?
Harry looked over his shoulder, his heart now pumping harder and
faster than ever. How long would it take Snape to release Montague
from the toilet? Would he come straight back to his office afterward,
or accompany Montague to the hospital wing? Surely the latter . . .
Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, Snape
would want to make sure he was all right. . . .

639
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
Harry walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve and stood over
it, gazing into its depths. He hesitated, listening, then pulled out his
wand again. The office and the corridor beyond were completely
silent. He gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end
of his wand.
The silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast. Harry leaned for-
ward over it and saw that it had become transparent. He was, once
again, looking down into a room as though through a circular win-
dow in the ceiling. . . . In fact, unless he was much mistaken, he was
looking down upon the Great Hall. . . .
His breath was actually fogging the surface of Snape’s thoughts. . . .
His brain seemed to be in limbo. . . . It would be insane to do the
thing that he was so strongly tempted to do. . . . He was trembling.
. . . Snape could be back at any moment . . . but Harry thought of
Cho’s anger, of Malfoy’s jeering face, and a reckless daring seized him.
He took a great gulp of breath and plunged his face into the surface
of Snape’s thoughts. At once, the floor of the office lurched, tipping
Harry headfirst into the Pensieve. . . .
He was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as he
went, and then —
He was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four
House tables were gone. Instead there were more than a hundred
smaller tables, all facing the same way, at each of which sat a student,
head bent low, scribbling on a roll of parchment. The only sound was
the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted
their parchment. It was clearly exam time.
Sunshine was streaming through the high windows onto the bent
heads, which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light.
Harry looked around carefully. Snape had to be here somewhere. . . .
This was his memory. . . .
And there he was, at a table right behind Harry. Harry stared.
Snape-the-teenager had a stringy, pallid look about him, like a plant

640
SNAPE’S WORST
MEMORY
kept in the dark. His hair was lank and greasy and was flopping onto
the table, his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the
parchment as he scribbled. Harry moved around behind Snape and
read the heading of the examination paper:
defense against the dark arts —
ordinary wizarding level
So Snape had to be fifteen or sixteen, around Harry’s own age. His
hand was flying across the parchment; he had written at least a foot
more than his closest neighbors, and yet his writing was minuscule
and cramped.
“Five more minutes!”
The voice made Harry jump; turning, he saw the top of Professor
Flitwick’s head moving between the desks a short distance away. Pro-
fessor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair . . . very
untidy black hair. . . .
Harry moved so quickly that, had he been solid, he would have
knocked desks flying. Instead he seemed to slide, dreamlike, across
two aisles and up a third. The back of the black-haired boy’s head
drew nearer and nearer. . . . He was straightening up now, putting
down his quill, pulling his roll of parchment toward him so as to
reread what he had written. . . .
Harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteen-
year-old father.
Excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach: It was as though he
was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes. James’s eyes were
hazel, his nose was slightly longer than Harry’s, and there was no scar
on his forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same
eyebrows. James’s hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry’s did, his
hands could have been Harry’s, and Harry could tell that when James
stood up, they would be within an inch of each other’s heights.
James yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair, making it even

641
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
messier than it had been. Then, with a glance toward Professor
Flitwick, he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats
behind him.
With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the
thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease, tilting it back
on two legs. He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes
with a sort of casual elegance neither James’s nor Harry’s could ever
have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully,
though he didn’t seem to have noticed. And two seats along from this
girl — Harry’s stomach gave another pleasurable squirm — was Re-
mus Lupin. He looked rather pale and peaky (was the full moon ap-
proaching?) and was absorbed in the exam: As he reread his answers
he scratched his chin with the end of his quill, frowning slightly.
So that meant Wormtail had to be around here somewhere too . . .
and sure enough, Harry spotted him within seconds: a small, mousy-
haired boy with a pointed nose. Wormtail looked anxious; he was
chewing his fingernails, staring down at his paper, scuffing the ground
with his toes. Every now and then he glanced hopefully at his neigh-
bor’s paper. Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment, then back at
James, who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment. He had
drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters L. E. What did they
stand for?
“Quills down, please!” squeaked Professor Flitwick. “That means
you too, Stebbins! Please remain seated while I collect your parch-
ment! Accio!”
More than a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and
into Professor Flitwick’s outstretched arms, knocking him backward
off his feet. Several people laughed. A couple of students at the front
desks got up, took hold of Professor Flitwick beneath the elbows, and
lifted him onto his feet again.
“Thank you . . . thank you,” panted Professor Flitwick. “Very well,
everybody, you’re free to go!”

642
SNAPE’S WORST
MEMORY
Harry looked down at his father, who had hastily crossed out the
L. E. he had been embellishing, jumped to his feet, stuffed his quill
and the exam question paper into his bag, which he slung over his
back, and stood waiting for Sirius to join him.
Harry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away, mov-
ing between the tables toward the doors into the entrance hall, still
absorbed in his own examination paper. Round-shouldered yet angu-
lar, he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, his oily hair
swinging about his face.
A gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James and Sirius,
and by planting himself in the midst of this group, Harry managed to
keep Snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of
James and his friends.
“Did you like question ten, Moony?” asked Sirius as they emerged
into the entrance hall.
“Loved it,” said Lupin briskly. “ ‘Give five signs that identify the
werewolf.’ Excellent question.”
“D’you think you managed to get all the signs?” said James in tones
of mock concern.
“Think I did,” said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd throng-
ing around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds.
“One: He’s sitting on my chair. Two: He’s wearing my clothes. Three:
His name’s Remus Lupin . . .”
Wormtail was the only one who didn’t laugh.
“I got the snout shape, the pupils of the eyes, and the tufted tail,”
he said anxiously, “but I couldn’t think what else —”
“How thick are you, Wormtail?” said James impatiently. “You run
round with a werewolf once a month —”
“Keep your voice down,” implored Lupin.
Harry looked anxiously behind him again. Snape remained close
by, still buried in his examination questions; but this was Snape’s
memory, and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in a

643
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
different direction once outside in the grounds, he, Harry, would not
be able to follow James any farther. To his intense relief, however,
when James and his three friends strode off down the lawn toward the
lake, Snape followed, still poring over the paper and apparently with
no fixed idea of where he was going. By jogging a little ahead of him,
Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others.
“Well, I thought that paper was a piece of cake,” he heard Sirius say.
“I’ll be surprised if I don’t get Outstanding on it at least.”
“Me too,” said James. He put his hand in his pocket and took out
a struggling Golden Snitch.
“Where’d you get that?”
“Nicked it,” said James casually. He started playing with the Snitch,
allowing it to fly as much as a foot away and seizing it again; his re-
flexes were excellent. Wormtail watched him in awe.
They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge
of the lake where Harry, Ron, and Hermione had spent a Sunday fin-
ishing their homework, and threw themselves down on the grass.
Harry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw, to his delight,
that Snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadows of a
clump of bushes. He was as deeply immersed in the O.W.L. paper as
ever, which left Harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech
and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree.
The sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake, on the
bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the Great
Hall were sitting with shoes and socks off, cooling their feet in the
water.
Lupin had pulled out a book and was reading. Sirius stared around
at the students milling over the grass, looking rather haughty and
bored, but very handsomely so. James was still playing with the
Snitch, letting it zoom farther and farther away, almost escaping but
always grabbed at the last second. Wormtail was watching him with
his mouth open. Every time James made a particularly difficult catch,

644
SNAPE’S WORST
MEMORY
Wormtail gasped and applauded. After five minutes of this, Harry
wondered why James didn’t tell Wormtail to get a grip on himself, but
James seemed to be enjoying the attention. Harry noticed his father
had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to make sure it did not
get too tidy, and also that he kept looking over at the girls by the wa-
ter’s edge.
“Put that away, will you?” said Sirius finally, as James made a fine
catch and Wormtail let out a cheer. “Before Wormtail wets himself
from excitement.”
Wormtail turned slightly pink but James grinned.
“If it bothers you,” he said, stuffing the Snitch back in his pocket.
Harry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only one for
whom James would have stopped showing off.
“I’m bored,” said Sirius. “Wish it was full moon.”
“You might,” said Lupin darkly from behind his book. “We’ve still
got Transfiguration, if you’re bored you could test me. . . . Here.” He
held out his book.
Sirius snorted. “I don’t need to look at that rubbish, I know it all.”
“This’ll liven you up, Padfoot,” said James quietly. “Look who it
is. . . .”
Sirius’s head turned. He had become very still, like a dog that has
scented a rabbit.
“Excellent,” he said softly. “Snivellus.”
Harry turned to see what Sirius was looking at.
Snape was on his feet again, and was stowing the O.W.L. paper in
his bag. As he emerged from the shadows of the bushes and set off
across the grass, Sirius and James stood up. Lupin and Wormtail re-
mained sitting: Lupin was still staring down at his book, though his
eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his
eyebrows. Wormtail was looking from Sirius and James to Snape with
a look of avid anticipation on his face.
“All right, Snivellus?” said James loudly.

645
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an at-
tack: Dropping his bag, he plunged his hand inside his robes, and his
wand was halfway into the air when James shouted, “Expelliarmus!”
Snape’s wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud
in the grass behind him. Sirius let out a bark of laughter.
“Impedimenta!” he said, pointing his wand at Snape, who was
knocked off his feet, halfway through a dive toward his own fallen
wand.
Students all around had turned to watch. Some of them had gotten
to their feet and were edging nearer to watch. Some looked apprehen-
sive, others entertained.
Snape lay panting on the ground. James and Sirius advanced on
him, wands up, James glancing over his shoulder at the girls at the wa-
ter’s edge as he went. Wormtail was on his feet now, watching hun-
grily, edging around Lupin to get a clearer view.
“How’d the exam go, Snivelly?” said James.
“I was watching him, his nose was touching the parchment,” said
Sirius viciously. “There’ll be great grease marks all over it, they won’t
be able to read a word.”
Several people watching laughed; Snape was clearly unpopular.
Wormtail sniggered shrilly. Snape was trying to get up, but the jinx
was still operating on him; he was struggling, as though bound by in-
visible ropes.
“You — wait,” he panted, staring up at James with an expression of
purest loathing. “You — wait. . . .”
“Wait for what?” said Sirius coolly. “What’re you going to do, Sniv-
elly, wipe your nose on us?”
Snape let out a stream of mixed swearwords and hexes, but his
wand being ten feet away nothing happened.
“Wash out your mouth,” said James coldly. “Scourgify!”
Pink soap bubbles streamed from Snape’s mouth at once; the froth
was covering his lips, making him gag, choking him —

646
SNAPE’S WORST
MEMORY
“Leave him ALONE!”
James and Sirius looked around. James’s free hand jumped to his
hair again.
It was one of the girls from the lake edge. She had thick, dark red
hair that fell to her shoulders and startlingly green almond-shaped
eyes — Harry’s eyes.
Harry’s mother . . .
“All right, Evans?” said James, and the tone of his voice was sud-
denly pleasant, deeper, more mature.
“Leave him alone,” Lily repeated. She was looking at James with
every sign of great dislike. “What’s he done to you?”
“Well,” said James, appearing to deliberate the point, “it’s more the
fact that he exists, if you know what I mean. . . .”
Many of the surrounding watchers laughed, Sirius and Wormtail
included, but Lupin, still apparently intent on his book, didn’t, and
neither did Lily.
“You think you’re funny,” she said coldly. “But you’re just an arro-
gant, bullying toerag, Potter. Leave him alone.”
“I will if you go out with me, Evans,” said James quickly. “Go on
. . . Go out with me, and I’ll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again.”
Behind him, the Impediment Jinx was wearing off. Snape was be-
ginning to inch toward his fallen wand, spitting out soapsuds as he
crawled.
“I wouldn’t go out with you if it was a choice between you and the
giant squid,” said Lily.
“Bad luck, Prongs,” said Sirius briskly, turning back to Snape. “OY!”
But too late; Snape had directed his wand straight at James; there
was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James’s face,
spattering his robes with blood. James whirled about; a second flash of
light later, Snape was hanging upside down in the air, his robes falling
over his head to reveal skinny, pallid legs and a pair of graying
underpants.

647
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
Many people in the small crowd watching cheered. Sirius, James,
and Wormtail roared with laughter.
Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as
though she was going to smile, said, “Let him down!”
“Certainly,” said James and he jerked his wand upward. Snape fell
into a crumpled heap on the ground. Disentangling himself from his
robes, he got quickly to his feet, wand up, but Sirius said, “Petrificus
Totalus!” and Snape keeled over again at once, rigid as a board.
“LEAVE HIM ALONE!” Lily shouted. She had her own wand out
now. James and Sirius eyed it warily.
“Ah, Evans, don’t make me hex you,” said James earnestly.
“Take the curse off him, then!”
James sighed deeply, then turned to Snape and muttered the
countercurse.
“There you go,” he said, as Snape struggled to his feet again, “you’re
lucky Evans was here, Snivellus —”
“I don’t need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her!”
Lily blinked. “Fine,” she said coolly. “I won’t bother in future. And
I’d wash your pants if I were you, Snivellus.”
“Apologize to Evans!” James roared at Snape, his wand pointed
threateningly at him.
“I don’t want you to make him apologize,” Lily shouted, rounding
on James. “You’re as bad as he is. . . .”
“What?” yelped James. “I’d NEVER call you a — you-know-what!”
“Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like
you’ve just got off your broomstick, showing off with that stupid
Snitch, walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you
just because you can — I’m surprised your broomstick can get off the
ground with that fat head on it. You make me SICK.”
She turned on her heel and hurried away.
“Evans!” James shouted after her, “Hey, EVANS!”
But she didn’t look back.

648
SNAPE’S WORST
MEMORY
“What is it with her?” said James, trying and failing to look as
though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him.
“Reading between the lines, I’d say she thinks you’re a bit conceited,
mate,” said Sirius.
“Right,” said James, who looked furious now, “right —”
There was another flash of light, and Snape was once again hang-
ing upside down in the air.
“Who wants to see me take off Snivelly’s pants?”
But whether James really did take off Snape’s pants, Harry never
found out. A hand had closed tight over his upper arm, closed with a
pincerlike grip. Wincing, Harry looked around to see who had hold of
him, and saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adult-sized Snape
standing right beside him, white with rage.
“Having fun?”
Harry felt himself rising into the air. The summer’s day evaporated
around him, he was floating upward through icy blackness, Snape’s
hand still tight upon his upper arm. Then, with a swooping feeling as
though he had turned head over heels in midair, his feet hit the stone
floor of Snape’s dungeon, and he was standing again beside the Pen-
sieve on Snape’s desk in the shadowy, present-day Potions master’s
study.
“So,” said Snape, gripping Harry’s arm so tightly Harry’s hand was
starting to feel numb. “So . . . been enjoying yourself, Potter?”
“N-no . . .” said Harry, trying to free his arm.
It was scary: Snape’s lips were shaking, his face was white, his teeth
were bared.
“Amusing man, your father, wasn’t he?” said Snape, shaking Harry
so hard that his glasses slipped down his nose.
“I — didn’t —”
Snape threw Harry from him with all his might. Harry fell hard
onto the dungeon floor.
“You will not tell anybody what you saw!” Snape bellowed.

649
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
“No,” said Harry, getting to his feet as far from Snape as he could.
“No, of course I w —”
“Get out, get out, I don’t want to see you in this office ever again!”
And as Harry hurtled toward the door, a jar of dead cockroaches
exploded over his head. He wrenched the door open and flew away up
the corridor, stopping only when he had put three floors between
himself and Snape. There he leaned against the wall, panting, and
rubbing his bruised arm.
He had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower so early, nor
to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just seen. What was making
Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or hav-
ing jars thrown at him — it was that he knew how it felt to be humil-
iated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew exactly how Snape
had felt as his father had taunted him, and that judging from what he
had just seen, his father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had al-
ways told him.

B
ut why haven’t you got Occlumency lessons anymore?” said Her-
mione, frowning.
“I’ve told you,” Harry muttered. “Snape reckons I can carry on by
myself now I’ve got the basics. . . .”
“So you’ve stopped having funny dreams?” said Hermione skepti-
cally.
“Pretty much,” said Harry, not looking at her.
“Well, I don’t think Snape should stop until you’re absolutely sure
you can control them!” said Hermione indignantly. “Harry, I think
you should go back to him and ask —”
“No,” said Harry forcefully. “Just drop it, Hermione, okay?”
It was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione, as was her
custom, had spent a large part of the day drawing up study schedules
for the three of them. Harry and Ron had let her do it — it was easier
than arguing with her and, in any case, they might come in useful.
Ron had been startled to discover that there were only six weeks left
until their exams.

651
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
“How can that come as a shock?” Hermione demanded, as she
tapped each little square on Ron’s schedule with her wand so that it
flashed a different color according to its subject.
“I dunno . . .” said Ron, “there’s been a lot going on. . . .”
“Well, there you are,” she said, handing him his schedule, “if you
follow that you should do fine.”
Ron looked down it gloomily, but then brightened.
“You’ve given me an evening off every week!”
“That’s for Quidditch practice,” said Hermione.
The smile faded from Ron’s face.
“What’s the point?” he said. “We’ve got about as much chance of
winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad’s got of becoming Min-
ister of Magic. . . .”
Hermione said nothing. She was looking at Harry, who was staring
blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks
pawed at his hand, trying to get his ears scratched.
“What’s wrong, Harry?”
“What?” he said quickly. “Nothing . . .”
He seized his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and pretended to be
looking something up in the index. Crookshanks gave him up as a bad
job and slunk away under Hermione’s chair.
“I saw Cho earlier,” said Hermione tentatively, “and she looked re-
ally miserable too. . . . Have you two had a row again?”
“Wha — oh yeah, we have,” said Harry, seizing gratefully on the
excuse.
“What about?”
“That sneak friend of hers, Marietta,” said Harry.
“Yeah, well, I don’t blame you!” said Ron angrily, setting down his
study schedule. “If it hadn’t been for her . . .”
Ron went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe, which Harry
found helpful. All he had to do was look angry, nod, and say “yeah”

652
CAREER ADVICE
and “that’s right” whenever Ron drew breath, leaving his mind free to
dwell, ever more miserably, on what he had seen in the Pensieve.
He felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside.
He had been so sure that his parents had been wonderful people that
he never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving Snape’s aspersions
on his father’s character. Hadn’t people like Hagrid and Sirius told
Harry how wonderful his father had been? (Yeah, well, look what
Sirius was like himself, said a nagging voice inside Harry’s head. . . .
He was as bad, wasn’t he?) Yes, he had once overheard Professor
McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemak-
ers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the
Weasley twins, and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dan-
gling someone upside down for the fun of it . . . not unless they re-
ally loathed them . . . Perhaps Malfoy, or somebody who really
deserved it . . .
Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had
suffered at James’s hands — but hadn’t Lily asked, “What’s he done to
you?” And hadn’t James replied, “It’s more the fact that he exists, if you
know what I mean?” Hadn’t James started it all simply because Sirius
said he was bored? Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grim-
mauld Place that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that
he would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius. . . .
But in the Pensieve, he had sat there and let it all happen. . . .
Harry reminded himself that Lily had intervened; his mother had
been decent, yet the memory of the look on her face as she had
shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as anything else. She
had clearly loathed James and Harry simply could not understand
how they could have ended up married. Once or twice he even won-
dered whether James had forced her into it. . . .
For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of
comfort, of inspiration. Whenever someone had told him he was like

653
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
James he had glowed with pride inside. And now . . . now he felt cold
and miserable at the thought of him.
The weather grew breezier, brighter, and warmer as the holidays
passed, but Harry was stuck with the rest of the fifth and seventh
years, who were all trapped inside, traipsing back and forth to the li-
brary. Harry pretended that his bad mood had no other cause but the
approaching exams, and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of study-
ing themselves, his excuse went unchallenged.
“Harry, I’m talking to you, can you hear me?”
“Huh?”
He looked around. Ginny Weasley, looking very windswept, had
joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone. It was
late on Sunday evening; Hermione had gone back to Gryffindor
Tower to review Ancient Runes; Ron had Quidditch practice.
“Oh hi,” said Harry, pulling his books back toward him. “How
come you’re not at practice?”
“It’s over,” said Ginny. “Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hos-
pital wing.”
“Why?”
“Well, we’re not sure, but we think he knocked himself out with his
own bat.” She sighed heavily. “Anyway . . . a package just arrived, it’s
only just got through Umbridge’s new screening process. . . .”
She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper onto the table; it had
clearly been unwrapped and carelessly rewrapped, and there was a
scribbled note across it in red ink, reading inspected and passed by
the hogwarts high inquisitor.
“It’s Easter eggs from Mum,” said Ginny. “There’s one for you. . . .
There you go. . . .”
She handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small,
iced Snitches and, according to the packaging, containing a bag of
Fizzing Whizbees. Harry looked at it for a moment, then, to his hor-
ror, felt a hard lump rise in his throat.

654
CAREER ADVICE
“Are you okay, Harry?” asked Ginny quietly.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” said Harry gruffly. The lump in his throat was
painful. He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made
him feel like this.
“You seem really down lately,” Ginny persisted. “You know, I’m
sure if you just talked to Cho . . .”
“It’s not Cho I want to talk to,” said Harry brusquely.
“Who is it, then?” asked Ginny.
“I . . .”
He glanced around to make quite sure that nobody was listening;
Madam Pince was several shelves away, stamping out a pile of books
for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott.
“I wish I could talk to Sirius,” he muttered. “But I know I can’t.”
More to give himself something to do than because he really
wanted any, Harry unwrapped his Easter egg, broke off a large bit,
and put it into his mouth.
“Well,” said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg too, “if
you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to
do it. . . .”
“Come on,” said Harry hopelessly. “With Umbridge policing the
fires and reading all our mail?”
“The thing about growing up with Fred and George,” said Ginny
thoughtfully, “is that you sort of start thinking anything’s possible if
you’ve got enough nerve.”
Harry looked at her. Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate —
Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with demen-
tors — or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had
been burning inside him for a week, but he felt a bit more hopeful. . . .
“WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?”
“Oh damn,” whispered Ginny, jumping to her feet. “I forgot —”
Madam Pince was swooping down upon them, her shriveled face
contorted with rage.

655
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
“Chocolate in the library!” she screamed. “Out — out — OUT!”
And whipping out her wand, she caused Harry’s books, bag, and
ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library, whacking them
repeatedly over the head as they ran.
As though to underline the importance of their upcoming examina-
tions, a batch of pamphlets, leaflets, and notices concerning various
Wizarding careers appeared on the tables in Gryffindor Tower shortly
before the end of the holidays, along with yet another notice on the
board, which read:
CAREER ADVICE
All fifth years will be required to attend a short meeting
with their Head of House during the first week of the Sum-
mer term, in which they will be given the opportunity to
discuss their future careers. Times of individual appoint-
ments are listed below.
Harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in Pro-
fessor McGonagall’s office at half-past two on Monday, which would
mean missing most of Divination. He and the other fifth years spent
a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all
the career information that had been left there for their perusal.
“Well, I don’t fancy Healing,” said Ron on the last evening of the
holidays. He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone-
and-wand emblem of St. Mungo’s on its front. “It says here you need
at least an E at N.E.W.T. level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration,
Charms, and Defense Against the Dark Arts. I mean . . . blimey. . . .
Don’t want much, do they?”
“Well, it’s a very responsible job, isn’t it?” said Hermione absently.
She was poring over a bright pink-and-orange leaflet that was headed
so you think you’d like to work in muggle relations? “You don’t

CAREER ADVICE
seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles. . . . All they
want is an O.W.L. in Muggle Studies. . . . ‘Much more important is your
enthusiasm, patience, and a good sense of fun!’ ”
“You’d need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,”
said Harry darkly. “Good sense of when to duck, more like . . .” He
was halfway through a pamphlet on Wizard banking. “Listen to this:
“ ‘Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure, and
substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a position
with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting Curse-
Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad. . . .’ They want Arithmancy,
though. . . . You could do it, Hermione!”
“I don’t much fancy banking,” said Hermione vaguely, now im-
mersed in have you got what it takes to train security trolls?
“Hey,” said a voice in Harry’s ear. He looked around; Fred and
George had come to join them. “Ginny’s had a word with us about
you,” said Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them
and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to
slide off onto the floor. “She says you need to talk to Sirius?”
“What?” said Hermione sharply, freezing with her hand halfway
toward picking up make a bang at the department of magical
accidents and catastrophes.
“Yeah . . .” said Harry, trying to sound casual, “yeah, I thought I’d
like —”
“Don’t be so ridiculous,” said Hermione, straightening up and
looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes. “With Um-
bridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls?”
“Well, we think we can find a way around that,” said George,
stretching and smiling. “It’s a simple matter of causing a diversion.
Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the
mayhem front during the Easter holidays?”
“What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure
time?” continued Fred. “No point at all, we answered ourselves. And

657
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
of course, we’d have messed up people’s studying too, which would be
the very last thing we’d want to do.”
He gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod. She looked rather
taken aback by this thoughtfulness.
“But it’s business as usual from tomorrow,” Fred continued briskly.
“And if we’re going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that
Harry can have his chat with Sirius?”
“Yes, but still,” said Hermione with an air of explaining something
very simple to somebody very obtuse, “even if you do cause a diver-
sion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him?”
“Umbridge’s office,” said Harry quietly.
He had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could think of no
alternative; Umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was
not being watched was her own.
“Are — you — insane?” said Hermione in a hushed voice.
Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the cultivated fungus trade
and was watching the conversation warily.
“I don’t think so,” said Harry, shrugging.
“And how are you going to get in there in the first place?”
Harry was ready for this question.
“Sirius’s knife,” he said.
“Excuse me?”
“Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that’ll open any lock,”
said Harry. “So even if she’s bewitched the door so Alohomora won’t
work, which I bet she has —”
“What do you think about this?” Hermione demanded of Ron, and
Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs. Weasley appealing to her hus-
band during Harry’s first dinner in Grimmauld Place.
“I dunno,” said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an
opinion. “If Harry wants to do it, it’s up to him, isn’t it?”
“Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,” said Fred, clapping Ron
hard on the back. “Right, then. We’re thinking of doing it tomorrow,

658
CAREER ADVICE
just after lessons, because it should cause maximum impact if every-
body’s in the corridors — Harry, we’ll set it off in the east wing some-
where, draw her right away from her own office — I reckon we
should be able to guarantee you, what, twenty minutes?” he said,
looking at George.
“Easy,” said George.
“What sort of diversion is it?” asked Ron.
“You’ll see, little bro,” said Fred, as he and George got up again.
“At least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy’s corridor
round about five o’clock tomorrow.”
Harry awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as he
had done on the morning of his hearing at the Ministry of Magic. It
was not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridge’s office and us-
ing her fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous,
though that was certainly bad enough — today also happened to be
the first time he would be in close proximity with Snape since Snape
had thrown him out of his office, as they had Potions that day.
After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry
got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville’s
bed, staring out on a truly glorious morning. The sky was a clear,
misty, opalescent blue. Directly ahead of him, Harry could see the
towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented
Snape. He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that
would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was des-
perate to hear Sirius’s own account of what had happened, to know of
any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for his
father’s behavior. . . .
Something caught Harry’s attention: movement on the edge of the
Forbidden Forest. Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid
emerging from between the trees. He seemed to be limping. As Harry
watched, Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared

659
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
inside it. Harry watched the cabin for several minutes. Hagrid did not
emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could
not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire. . . .
Harry turned away from the window, headed back to his trunk, and
started to dress.
With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge’s office ahead,
Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not
reckoned on Hermione’s almost continual attempts to dissuade him
from what he was planning to do at five o’clock. For the first time ever,
she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic
as Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admoni-
tions that Harry tried very hard to ignore.
“. . . and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled, she’ll
be able to guess you’ve been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect
she’ll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions. . . .”
“Hermione,” said Ron in a low and indignant voice, “are you going
to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to
take notes instead?”
“You take notes for a change, it won’t kill you!”
By the time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry nor Ron was
speaking to Hermione any longer. Undeterred, she took advantage of
their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings, all
uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to
waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks.
Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry
were invisible. Harry was, of course, well used to this tactic, as it was
one of Uncle Vernon’s favorites, and on the whole was grateful he had
to suffer nothing worse. In fact, compared to what he usually had to
endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he found
the new approach something of an improvement and was pleased to
find that when left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration
Draught quite easily. At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the

660
CAREER ADVICE
potion into a flask, corked it, and took it up to Snape’s desk for mark-
ing, feeling that he might at last have scraped an E.
He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise; Malfoy
gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around again. His po-
tion sample lay in pieces on the floor, and Snape was watching him
with a look of gloating pleasure.
“Whoops,” he said softly. “Another zero, then, Potter . . .”
Harry was too incensed to speak. He strode back to his cauldron,
intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to
his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished.
“I’m sorry!” said Hermione with her hands over her mouth. “I’m
really sorry, Harry, I thought you’d finished, so I cleared up!”
Harry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang he
hurried out of the dungeon without a backward glance and made sure
that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so
that Hermione could not start nagging him about using Umbridge’s
office again.
He was in such a bad mood by the time that he got to Divination
that he had quite forgotten his career appointment with Professor
McGonagall, remembering only when Ron asked him why he wasn’t
in her office. He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only
a few minutes late.
“Sorry, Professor,” he panted, as he closed the door. “I forgot. . . .”
“No matter, Potter,” she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody
else sniffed from the corner. Harry looked around.
Professor Umbridge was sitting there, a clipboard on her knee, a
fussy little pie-frill around her neck, and a small, horribly smug smile
on her face.
“Sit down, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall tersely. Her hands
shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk.
Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pre-
tend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard.

661
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
“Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might
have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into
sixth and seventh years,” said Professor McGonagall. “Have you had
any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave
Hogwarts?”
“Er,” said Harry.
He was finding the scratching noise from behind him very dis-
tracting.
“Yes?” Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.
“Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,” Harry mumbled.
“You’d need top grades for that,” said Professor McGonagall, ex-
tracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and
opening it. “They ask for a minimum of five N.E.W.T.s, and nothing
under ‘Exceeds Expectations’ grade, I see. Then you would be re-
quired to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at
the Auror office. It’s a difficult career path, Potter; they only take the
best. In fact, I don’t think anybody has been taken on in the last three
years.”
At this moment Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as
though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it. Professor
McGonagall ignored her.
“You’ll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?”
she went on, talking a little more loudly than before.
“Yes,” said Harry. “Defense Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?”
“Naturally,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “I would also
advise —”
Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this
time. Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened
them again, and continued as though nothing had happened.
“I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently
need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell
you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my N.E.W.T.

662
CAREER ADVICE
classes unless they have achieved ‘Exceeds Expectations’ or higher at
Ordinary Wizarding Level. I’d say you’re averaging ‘Acceptable’ at the
moment, so you’ll need to put in some good hard work before the ex-
ams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms,
always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,” she added, with the
merest flicker of a smile. “Poisons and antidotes are essential study for
Aurors. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to
take students who get anything other than ‘Outstanding’ in their
O.W.L.s, so —”
Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet.
“May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?” Professor McGonagall
asked curtly, without looking at Professor Umbridge.
“Oh no, thank you very much,” said Umbridge, with that simper-
ing laugh Harry hated so much. “I just wondered whether I could
make the teensiest interruption, Minerva?”
“I daresay you’ll find you can,” said Professor McGonagall through
tightly gritted teeth.
“I was just wondering whether Mr. Potter has quite the tempera-
ment for an Auror?” said Professor Umbridge sweetly.
“Were you?” said Professor McGonagall haughtily. “Well, Potter,”
she continued, as though there had been no interruption, “if you are
serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on
bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Profes-
sor Flitwick has graded you between Acceptable’ and ‘Exceeds Expec-
tations’ for the last two years, so your Charm work seems satisfactory;
as for Defense Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally
high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you — are you quite sure
you wouldn’t like a cough drop, Dolores?”
“Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,” simpered Professor Um-
bridge, who had just coughed her loudest yet. “I was just concerned
that you might not have Harry’s most recent Defense Against the
Dark Arts marks in front of you. I’m quite sure I slipped in a note . . .”

663
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
“What, this thing?” said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revul-
sion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves
of Harry’s folder. She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised,
then placed it back into the folder without comment.
“Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a
pronounced aptitude for the subject, and obviously for an Auror —”
“Did you not understand my note, Minerva?” asked Professor Um-
bridge in honeyed tones, quite forgetting to cough.
“Of course I understood it,” said Professor McGonagall, her teeth
clenched so tightly that the words came out a little muffled.
“Well, then, I am confused. . . . I’m afraid I don’t quite understand
how you can give Mr. Potter false hope that —”
“False hope?” repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look
round at Professor Umbridge. “He has achieved high marks in all his
Defense Against the Dark Arts tests —”
“I’m terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you
will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in
his classes with me —”
“I should have made my meaning plainer,” said Professor McGo-
nagall, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes. “He has
achieved high marks in all Defense Against the Dark Arts tests set by
a competent teacher.”
Professor Umbridge’s smile vanished as suddenly as a lightbulb
blowing. She sat back in her chair, turned a sheet on her clipboard,
and began scribbling very fast indeed, her bulging eyes rolling from
side to side. Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin
nostrils flared, her eyes burning.
“Any questions, Potter?”
“Yes,” said Harry. “What sort of character and aptitude tests do the
Ministry do on you, if you get enough N.E.W.T.s?”
“Well, you’ll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pres-

664
CAREER ADVICE
sure and so forth,” said Professor McGonagall, “perseverance and ded-
ication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to men-
tion very high skills in practical defense. It will mean a lot more study
even after you’ve left school, so unless you’re prepared to —”
“I think you’ll also find,” said Umbridge, her voice very cold now,
“that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Au-
rora. Their criminal records.”
“— unless you’re prepared to take even more exams after Hog-
warts, you should really look at another —”
“— which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an
Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school.”
“A very good chance, then,” said Professor McGonagall.
“Potter has a criminal record,” said Umbridge loudly.
“Potter has been cleared of all charges,” said Professor McGonagall,
even more loudly.
Professor Umbridge stood up. She was so short that this did not
make a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanor
had given place to a hard fury that made her broad, flabby face look
oddly sinister.
“Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!”
Professor McGonagall got to her feet too, and in her case this was a
much more impressive move. She towered over Professor Umbridge.
“Potter,” she said in ringing tones, “I will assist you to become an
Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly I will
make sure you achieve the required results!”
“The Minister of Magic will never employ Harry Potter!” said Um-
bridge, her voice rising furiously.
“There may well be a new Minister of Magic by the time Potter is
ready to join!” shouted Professor McGonagall.
“Aha!” shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby finger at
McGonagall. “Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Of course! That’s what you want, isn’t

665
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
it, Minerva McGonagall? You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Al-
bus Dumbledore! You think you’ll be where I am, don’t you, Senior
Undersecretary to the Minister and headmistress to boot!”
“You are raving,” said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful.
“Potter, that concludes our career consultation.”
Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the
room, not daring to look at Umbridge. He could hear her and Profes-
sor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back
along the corridor.
Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run
a race when she strode into their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson
that afternoon.
“I hope you’ve thought better of what you were planning to do,
Harry,” Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their
books to chapter thirty-four (“Non-Retaliation and Negotiation”).
“Umbridge looks like she’s in a really bad mood already. . . .”
Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who
kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes un-
focused, thinking. . . .
He could just imagine Professor McGonagall’s reaction if he were
caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge’s office mere hours after she
had vouched for him. . . . There was nothing to stop him simply go-
ing back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that sometime during the
next summer holiday he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the
scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve. . . . Nothing, except that
the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as
though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach. . . . And then
there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already
planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was
currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father’s old Invisi-
bility Cloak. . . .

666
CAREER ADVICE
But the fact remained that if he were caught . . .
“Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school, Harry!”
whispered Hermione, raising her book to hide her face from Um-
bridge. “And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for
nothing!”
He could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the mem-
ory of what his father had done on a summer’s day more than twenty
years ago. . . .
And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffin-
dor common room. . . .”You’re less like your father than I thought.
. . . The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James. . . .”
But did he want to be like his father anymore?
“Harry, don’t do it, please don’t do it!” Hermione said in anguished
tones as the bell rang at the end of the class.
He did not answer; he did not know what to do. Ron seemed de-
termined to give neither his opinion nor his advice. He would not
look at Harry, though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dis-
suading Harry some more, he said in a low voice, “Give it a rest, okay?
He can make up his own mind.”
Harry’s heart beat very fast as he left the classroom. He was halfway
along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakable sounds of
a diversion going off in the distance. There were screams and yells
reverberating from somewhere above them. People exiting the class-
rooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up
at the ceiling fearfully —
Then Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her
short legs would carry her. Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the
opposite direction: It was now or never.
“Harry — please!” said Hermione weakly.
But he had made up his mind — hitching his bag more securely
onto his shoulder he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students

667
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
now hurrying in the opposite direction, off to see what all the fuss was
about in the east wing. . . .
Harry reached the corridor where Umbridge’s office was situated
and found it deserted. Dashing behind a large suit of armor whose
helmet creaked around to watch him, he pulled open his bag, seized
Sirius’s knife, and donned the Invisibility Cloak. He then crept slowly
and carefully back out from behind the suit of armor and along the
corridor until he reached Umbridge’s door.
He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it
and moved it gently up and down, then withdrew it. There was a tiny
click, and the door swung open. He ducked inside the office, closed
the door quickly behind him, and looked around.
It was empty; nothing was moving except the horrible kittens on
the plates continuing to frolic on the wall above the confiscated
broomsticks.
Harry pulled off his cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found
what he was looking for within seconds: a small box containing glit-
tering Floo powder.
He crouched down in front of the empty grate, his hands shaking.
He had never done this before, though he thought he knew how it
must work. Sticking his head into the fireplace, he took a large pinch
of powder and dropped it onto the logs stacked neatly beneath him.
They exploded at once into emerald-green flames.
“Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!” Harry said loudly and clearly.
It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced;
he had traveled by Floo powder before, of course, but then it had been
his entire body that had spun around and around in the flames through
the network of Wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country:
This time, his knees remained firm upon the cold floor of Umbridge’s
office, and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire. . . .
And then, abruptly as it had begun, the spinning stopped. Feeling

668
CAREER ADVICE
rather sick and as though he was wearing an exceptionally hot muffler
around his head, Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up
out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat
poring over a piece of parchment.
“Sirius?”
The man jumped and looked around. It was not Sirius, but Lupin.
“Harry!” he said, looking thoroughly shocked. “What are you —
what’s happened, is everything all right?”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “I just wondered — I mean, I just fancied a —
a chat with Sirius.”
“I’ll call him,” said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking perplexed.
“He went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the at-
tic again. . . .”
And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen. Now he was left
with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs. He wondered why
Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak
out of the fire — his knees were already objecting painfully to their
prolonged contact with Umbridge’s hard stone floor.
Lupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later.
“What is it?” said Sirius urgently, sweeping his long dark hair out
of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire, so that he
and Harry were on a level; Lupin knelt down too, looking very con-
cerned. “Are you all right? Do you need help?”
“No,” said Harry, “it’s nothing like that. . . . I just wanted to talk
. . . about my dad. . . .”
They exchanged a look of great surprise, but Harry did not have
time to feel awkward or embarrassed; his knees were becoming sorer
by the second, and he guessed that five minutes had already passed
from the start of the diversion — George had only guaranteed him
twenty. He therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he
had seen in the Pensieve.

When he had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a mo-
ment. Then Lupin said quietly, “I wouldn’t like you to judge your
father on what you saw there, Harry. He was only fifteen —”
“I’m fifteen!” said Harry heatedly.
“Look, Harry,” said Sirius placatingly, “James and Snape hated each
other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of
those things, you can understand that, can’t you? I think James was
everything Snape wanted to be — he was popular, he was good at
Quidditch, good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this
little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts and James —
whatever else he may have appeared to you, Harry — always hated
the Dark Arts.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “but he just attacked Snape for no good reason,
just because — well, just because you said you were bored,” he fin-
ished with a slightly apologetic note in his voice.
“I’m not proud of it,” said Sirius quickly.
Lupin looked sideways at Sirius and then said, “Look, Harry, what
you’ve got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in
the school at whatever they did — everyone thought they were the
height of cool — if they sometimes got a bit carried away —”
“If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,” said Sirius.
Lupin smiled.
“He kept messing up his hair,” said Harry in a pained voice.
Sirius and Lupin laughed.
“I’d forgotten he used to do that,” said Sirius affectionately.
“Was he playing with the Snitch?” said Lupin eagerly.
“Yeah,” said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and
Lupin beamed reminiscently. “Well . . . I thought he was a bit of an
idiot.”
“Of course he was a bit of an idiot!” said Sirius bracingly. “We were
all idiots! Well — not Moony so much,” he said fairly, looking at
Lupin, but Lupin shook his head.

“Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?” he said. “Did I ever have the
guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?”
“Yeah, well,” said Sirius, “you made us feel ashamed of ourselves
sometimes. . . . That was something. . . .”
“And,” said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was
on his mind now he was here, “he kept looking over at the girls by the
lake, hoping they were watching him!”
“Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was
around,” said Sirius, shrugging. “He couldn’t stop himself showing off
whenever he got near her.”
“How come she married him?” Harry asked miserably. “She hated
him!”
“Nah, she didn’t,” said Sirius.
“She started going out with him in seventh year,” said Lupin.
“Once James had deflated his head a bit,” said Sirius.
“And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,” said Lupin.
“Even Snape?” said Harry.
“Well,” said Lupin slowly, “Snape was a special case. I mean, he
never lost an opportunity to curse James, so you couldn’t really expect
James to take that lying down, could you?”
“And my mum was okay with that?”
“She didn’t know too much about it, to tell you the truth,” said Sir-
ius. “I mean, James didn’t take Snape on dates with her and jinx him
in front of her, did he?”
Sirius frowned at Harry, who was still looking unconvinced.
“Look,” he said, “your father was the best friend I ever had, and he
was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen. He
grew out of it.”
“Yeah, okay,” said Harry heavily. “I just never thought I’d feel sorry
for Snape.”
“Now you mention it,” said Lupin, a faint crease between his eye-
brows, “how did Snape react when he found you’d seen all this?”

671
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
“He told me he’d never teach me Occlumency again,” said Harry
indifferently, “like that’s a big disappoint —”
“He WHAT?” shouted Sirius, causing Harry to jump and inhale a
mouthful of ashes.
“Are you serious, Harry?” said Lupin quickly. “He’s stopped giving
you lessons?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, surprised at what he considered a great overreac-
tion. “But it’s okay, I don’t care, it’s a bit of a relief to tell you the —”
“I’m coming up there to have a word with Snape!” said Sirius force-
fully and he actually made to stand up, but Lupin wrenched him back
down again.
“If anyone’s going to tell Snape it will be me!” he said firmly. “But
Harry, first of all, you’re to go back to Snape and tell him that on no ac-
count is he to stop giving you lessons — when Dumbledore hears —”
“I can’t tell him that, he’d kill me!” said Harry, outraged. “You
didn’t see him when we got out of the Pensieve —”
“Harry, there is nothing so important as you learning Occlu-
mency!” said Lupin sternly. “Do you understand me? Nothing!”
“Okay, okay,” said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention
annoyed. “I’ll . . . I’ll try and say something to him. . . . But it won’t
be . . .”
He fell silent. He could hear distant footsteps.
“Is that Kreacher coming downstairs?”
“No,” said Sirius, glancing behind him. “It must be somebody your
end . . .”
Harry’s heart skipped several beats.
“I’d better go!” he said hastily and he pulled his head backward out
of Grimmauld Place’s fire. For a moment his head seemed to be re-
volving on his shoulders, and then he found himself kneeling in front
of Umbridge’s fire with his head firmly back on, watching the emerald
flames flicker and die.

“Quickly, quickly!” he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside
the office door. “Ah, she’s left it open. . . .”
Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull
it back over himself when Filch burst into the office. He looked ab-
solutely delighted about something and was talking to himself fever-
ishly as he crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in Umbridge’s
desk, and began rifling through the papers inside it.
“Approval for Whipping . . . Approval for Whipping . . . I can do it
at last. . . . They’ve had it coming to them for years. . . .”
He pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly
back out of the door, clutching it to his chest.
Harry leapt to his feet and, making sure that he had his bag and the
Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open
the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling
along faster than Harry had ever seen him go.
One landing down from Umbridge’s office and Harry thought it
was safe to become visible again; he pulled off the cloak, shoved it in
his bag and hurried onward. There was a great deal of shouting and
movement coming from the entrance hall. He ran down the marble
staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled
there.
It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Stu-
dents were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them,
Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap);
teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. Prominent among the on-
lookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all look-
ing exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was
bobbing overhead, gazed down upon Fred and George, who stood in
the middle of the floor with the unmistakable look of two people who
had just been cornered.
“So!” said Umbridge triumphantly, whom Harry realized was

673
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
standing just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down
upon her prey. “So . . . you think it amusing to turn a school corridor
into a swamp, do you?”
“Pretty amusing, yeah,” said Fred, looking back up at her without
the slightest sign of fear.
Filch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with
happiness.
“I’ve got the form, Headmistress,” he said hoarsely, waving the
piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk. “I’ve
got the form and I’ve got the whips waiting. . . . Oh, let me do it
now. . . .”
“Very good, Argus,” she said. “You two,” she went on, gazing down
at Fred and George, “are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers
in my school.”
“You know what?” said Fred. “I don’t think we are.”
He turned to his twin.
“George,” said Fred, “I think we’ve outgrown full-time education.”
“Yeah, I’ve been feeling that way myself,” said George lightly.
“Time to test our talents in the real world, d’you reckon?” asked
Fred.
“Definitely,” said George.
And before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands
and said together, “Accio Brooms!”
Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to
his left he ducked just in time — Fred and George’s broomsticks,
one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge
had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor to-
ward their owners. They turned left, streaked down the stairs, and
stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on
the flagged stone floor.
“We won’t be seeing you,” Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging
his leg over his broomstick.

674
CAREER ADVICE
“Yeah, don’t bother to keep in touch,” said George, mounting his
own.
Fred looked around at the assembled students, and at the silent,
watchful crowd.
“If anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated up-
stairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley — Weasleys’ Wiz-
arding Wheezes,” he said in a loud voice. “Our new premises!”
“Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they’re going to
use our products to get rid of this old bat,” added George, pointing at
Professor Umbridge.
“STOP THEM!” shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the In-
quisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor,
shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously
below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his
level above the crowd.
“Give her hell from us, Peeves.”
And Peeves, whom Harry had never seen take an order from a stu-
dent before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute
as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the
students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious
sunset.

GRAWP
T
he story of Fred and George’s flight to freedom was retold so of-
ten over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon
become the stuff of Hogwarts legend. Within a week, even those who
had been eyewitnesses were half-convinced that they had seen the
twins dive-bomb Umbridge on their brooms, pelting her with Dung-
bombs before zooming out of the doors. In the immediate aftermath
of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them,
so that Harry frequently heard students saying things like, “Honestly,
some days I just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this
place,” or else, “One more lesson like that and I might just do a
Weasley. . . .”
Fred and George had made sure that nobody was likely to forget
them very soon. For one thing, they had not left instructions on how
to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of
the east wing. Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different
means of removing it but without success. Eventually the area was
roped off and Filch, gnashing his teeth furiously, was given the task of
punting students across it to their classrooms. Harry was certain that

676
GRAWP
teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp
in an instant, but just as in the case of Fred and George’s Wildfire
Whiz-Bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle.
Then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Umbridge’s
office door, through which Fred and George’s Cleansweeps had
smashed to rejoin their masters. Filch fitted a new door and removed
Harry’s Firebolt to the dungeons where, it was rumored, Umbridge
had set an armed security troll to guard it. However, her troubles were
far from over.
Inspired by Fred and George’s example, a great number of students
were now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers-in-
Chief. In spite of the new door, somebody managed to slip a hairy-
snouted niffler into Umbridge’s office, which promptly tore the place
apart in its search for shiny objects, leapt on Umbridge on her reen-
trance, and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers. Dungbombs
and Stinkpellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it be-
came the new fashion for students to perform Bubble-Head Charms
on themselves before leaving lessons, which ensured them a supply of
fresh clean air, even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of
wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads.
Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands,
desperate to catch miscreants, but the problem was that there were
now so many of them that he did not know which way to turn. The
Inquisitorial Squad were attempting to help him, but odd things kept
happening to its members. Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch
team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that
made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes. Pansy
Parkinson, to Hermione’s delight, missed all her lessons the following
day, as she had sprouted antlers.
Meanwhile it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred
and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts. Umbridge
only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to

677
CHAPTER THIRTY
faint, vomit, develop dangerous fevers, or else spout blood from both
nostrils. Shrieking with rage and frustration she attempted to trace the
mysterious symptoms to their source, but the students told her stub-
bornly they were suffering “Umbridge-itis.” After putting four succes-
sive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret she was
forced to give up and allow the bleeding, swooning, sweating, and
vomiting students to leave her classes in droves.
But not even the users of the Snackboxes could compete with that
master of chaos, Peeves, who seemed to have taken Fred’s parting
words deeply to heart. Cackling madly, he soared through the school,
upending tables, bursting out of blackboards, and toppling statues
and vases. Twice he shut Mrs. Norris inside suits of armor, from which
she was rescued, yowling loudly, by the furious caretaker. He smashed
lanterns and snuffed out candles, juggled burning torches over the
heads of screaming students, caused neatly stacked piles of parchment
to topple into fires or out of windows, flooded the second floor when
he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms, dropped a bag of tarantu-
las in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and, whenever he
fancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge
and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke.
None of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help
her. Indeed, a week after Fred and George’s departure Harry witnessed
Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves, who was deter-
minedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and could have sworn he heard
her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, “It unscrews
the other way.”
To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn
in the toilet. He remained confused and disorientated and his parents
were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive,
looking extremely angry.
“Should we say something?” said Hermione in a worried voice,
pressing her cheek against the Charms window so that she could see

678
GRAWP
Mr. and Mrs. Montague marching inside. “About what happened to
him? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him?”
“ ’Course not, he’ll recover,” said Ron indifferently.
“Anyway, more trouble for Umbridge, isn’t it?” said Harry in a sat-
isfied voice.
He and Ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be
charming with their wands. Harry’s spouted four very short legs that
would not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair. Ron’s
grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with
great difficulty, trembled for a few seconds, then folded, causing the
cup to crack into two.
“Reparo!” said Hermione quickly, mending Ron’s cup with a wave
of her wand. “That’s all very well, but what if Montague’s perma-
nently injured?”
“Who cares?” said Ron irritably, while his teacup stood drunkenly
again, trembling violently at the knees. “Montague shouldn’t have
tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he? If you want
to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me!”
“You?” she said, catching her teacup as it scampered happily away
across the desk on four sturdy little willow-patterned legs and replac-
ing it in front of her. “Why should I be worried about you?”
“When Mum’s next letter finally gets through Umbridge’s screen-
ing process,” said Ron bitterly, now holding his cup up while its frail
legs tried feebly to support its weight, “I’m going to be in deep trou-
ble. I wouldn’t be surprised if she’s sent a Howler again.”
“But —”
“It’ll be my fault Fred and George left, you wait,” said Ron darkly.
“She’ll say I should’ve stopped them leaving, I should’ve grabbed the
ends of their brooms and hung on or something. . . . Yeah, it’ll be all
my fault. . . .”
“Well, if she does say that it’ll be very unfair, you couldn’t have done
anything! But I’m sure she won’t, I mean, if it’s really true they’ve got

679
CHAPTER THIRTY
premises in Diagon Alley now, they must have been planning this for
ages. . . .”
“Yeah, but that’s another thing, how did they get premises?” said
Ron, hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed
again and it lay twitching before him. “It’s a bit dodgy, isn’t it? They’ll
need loads of Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley,
she’ll want to know what they’ve been up to, to get their hands on that
sort of gold. . . .”
“Well, yes, that occurred to me too,” said Hermione, allowing her
teacup to jog in neat little circles around Harry’s, whose stubby little
legs were still unable to touch the desktop. “I’ve been wondering
whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or
something awful. . . .”
“He hasn’t,” said Harry curtly.
“How do you know?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“Because —” Harry hesitated, but the moment to confess finally
seemed to have come. There was no good to be gained in keeping
silent if it meant anyone suspected that Fred and George were crimi-
nals. “Because they got the gold from me. I gave them my Triwizard
winnings last June.”
There was a shocked silence, then Hermione’s teacup jogged right
over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor.
“Oh, Harry, you didn’t !” she said.
“Yes, I did,” said Harry mutinously. “And I don’t regret it either —
I didn’t need the gold, and they’ll be great at a joke shop. . . .”
“But this is excellent!” said Ron, looking thrilled. “It’s all your fault,
Harry — Mum can’t blame me at all! Can I tell her?”
“Yeah, I suppose you’d better,” said Harry dully. “ ’Specially if she
thinks they’re receiving stolen cauldrons or something. . . .”
Hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson, but Harry
had a shrewd suspicion that her self-restraint was bound to crack be-

680
GRAWP
fore long. Sure enough, once they had left the castle for break and
were standing around in the weak May sunshine, she fixed Harry with
a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air.
Harry interrupted her before she had even started.
“It’s no good nagging me, it’s done,” he said firmly. “Fred and
George have got the gold — spent a good bit of it too, by the sounds
of it — and I can’t get it back from them and I don’t want to. So save
your breath, Hermione.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about Fred and George!” she said in
an injured voice.
Ron snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him a very dirty
look.
“No, I wasn’t!” she said angrily. “As a matter of fact, I was going to
ask Harry when he’s going to go back to Snape and ask for Occlu-
mency lessons again!”
Harry’s heart sank. Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred
and George’s dramatic departure, which admittedly had taken many
hours, Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news of Sirius. As
Harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to
Sirius in the first place, it had been hard to think of things to tell
them. He had ended up saying to them truthfully that Sirius wanted
Harry to resume Occlumency lessons. He had been regretting this
ever since; Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept revert-
ing to it when Harry least expected it.
“You can’t tell me you’ve stopped having funny dreams,” Hermione
said now, “because Ron told me last night you were muttering in your
sleep again. . . .”
Harry threw Ron a furious look. Ron had the grace to look
ashamed of himself.
“You were only muttering a bit,” he mumbled apologetically.
“Something about ‘just a bit farther.’ ”

681
CHAPTER THIRTY
“I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch,” Harry lied
brutally. “I was trying to get you to stretch out a bit farther to grab the
Quaffle.”
Ron’s ears went red. Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure: He had
not, of course, dreamed anything of the sort.
Last night he had once again made the journey along the Depart-
ment of Mysteries corridor. He had passed through the circular room,
then the room full of clicking and dancing light, until he found him-
self again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were
ranged dusty glass spheres. . . .
He had hurried straight toward row number ninety-seven, turned
left, and ran along it. . . . It had probably been then that he had spo-
ken aloud. . . . Just a bit farther . . . for he could feel his conscious self
struggling to wake . . . and before he had reached the end of the row,
he had found himself lying in bed again, gazing up at the canopy of
his four-poster.
“You are trying to block your mind, aren’t you?” said Hermione, look-
ing beadily at Harry. “You are keeping going with your Occlumency?”
“Of course I am,” said Harry, trying to sound as though this ques-
tion was insulting, but not quite meeting her eye. The truth was that
he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full
of dusty orbs that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue.
The problem was that with just under a month to go until the ex-
ams and every free moment devoted to studying, his mind seemed
saturated with information when he went to bed so that he found it
very difficult to get to sleep at all. When he did, his overwrought brain
presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams. He
also suspected that part of his mind — the part that often spoke in
Hermione’s voice — now felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down
that corridor ending in the black door, and sought to wake him before
he could reach journey’s end.
“You know,” said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, “if Mon-

682
GRAWP
tague doesn’t recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in
with a chance of winning the Cup.”
“Yeah, I s’pose so,” said Harry, glad of a change of subject.
“I mean, we’ve won one, lost one — if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff
next Saturday —”
“Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry, losing track of what he was agree-
ing to: Cho Chang had just walked across the courtyard, deter-
minedly not looking at him.
The final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Raven-
claw, was to take place on the last weekend of May. Although
Slytherin had been narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last
match, Gryffindor was not daring to hope for victory, due mainly
(though of course nobody said it to him) to Ron’s abysmal goalkeep-
ing record. He, however, seemed to have found a new optimism.
“I mean, I can’t get any worse, can I?” he told Harry and Hermione
grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match. “Nothing to lose
now, is there?”
“You know,” said Hermione, as she and Harry walked down to the
pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd, “I think Ron
might do better without Fred and George around. They never exactly
gave him a lot of confidence. . . .”
Luna Lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live ea-
gle perched on top of her head.
“Oh gosh, I forgot!” said Hermione, watching the eagle flapping its
wings as Luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing
Slytherins. “Cho will be playing, won’t she?”
Harry, who had not forgotten this, merely grunted.
They found seats in the topmost row of the stands. It was a fine,
clear day. Ron could not wish for better, and Harry found himself
hoping against hope that Ron would not give the Slytherins cause for
more rousing choruses of “Weasley Is Our King.”

Lee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred and George
had left, was commentating as usual. As the teams zoomed out onto
the pitches he named the players with something less than his usual
gusto.
“. . . Bradley . . . Davies . . . Chang,” he said, and Harry felt his
stomach perform, less of a back flip, more a feeble lurch as Cho
walked out onto the pitch, her shiny black hair rippling in the slight
breeze. He was not sure what he wanted to happen anymore, except
that he could not stand any more rows. Even the sight of her chatting
animatedly to Roger Davies as they prepared to mount their brooms
caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy.
“And they’re off!” said Lee. “And Davies takes the Quaffle immedi-
ately, Ravenclaw Captain Davies with the Quaffle, he dodges John-
son, he dodges Bell, he dodges Spinnet as well. . . . He’s going straight
for goal! He’s going to shoot — and — and —” Lee swore very
loudly. “And he’s scored.”
Harry and Hermione groaned with the rest of the Gryffindors. Pre-
dictably, horribly, the Slytherins on the other side of the stands began
to sing:
Weasley cannot save a thing,
He cannot block a single ring . . .
“Harry,” said a hoarse voice in Harry’s ear. “Hermione . . .”
Harry looked around and saw Hagrid’s enormous bearded face
sticking between the seats; apparently he had squeezed his way all
along the row behind, for the first and second years he had just passed
had a ruffled, flattened look about them. For some reason, Hagrid was
bent double as though anxious not to be seen, though he was still at
least four feet taller than everybody else.
“Listen,” he whispered, “can yeh come with me? Now? While ev’ry-
one’s watchin’ the match?”


“Er . . . can’t it wait, Hagrid?” asked Harry. “Till the match is
over?
“No,” said Hagrid. “No, Harry, it’s gotta be now . . . while ev’ry-
one’s lookin’ the other way. . . . Please?”
Hagrid’s nose was gently dripping blood. His eyes were both black-
ened. Harry had not seen him this close up since his return to the
school; he looked utterly woebegone.
“ ’Course,” said Harry at once, “ ’course we’ll come. . . .”
He and Hermione edged back along their row of seats, causing
much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them.
The people in Hagrid’s row were not complaining, merely attempting
to make themselves as small as possible.
“I ’ppreciate this, you two, I really do,” said Hagrid as they reached
the stairs. He kept looking around nervously as they descended to-
ward the lawn below. “I jus’ hope she doesn’ notice us goin’. . . .”
“You mean Umbridge?” said Harry. “She won’t, she’s got her whole
Inquisitorial Squad sitting with her, didn’t you see? She must be ex-
pecting trouble at the match.”
“Yeah, well, a bit o’ trouble wouldn’ hurt,” said Hagrid, pausing to
peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn be-
tween there and his cabin was deserted. “Give us more time . . .”
“What is it, Hagrid?” said Hermione, looking up at him with a
concerned expression on her face as they hurried across the lawn to-
ward the edge of the forest.
“Yeh — yeh’ll see in a mo’,” said Hagrid, looking over his shoulder
as a great roar rose from the stands behind them. “Hey — did some-
one jus’ score?”
“It’ll be Ravenclaw,” said Harry heavily.
“Good . . . good . . .” said Hagrid distractedly. “Tha’s good. . . .”
They had to jog to keep up with him as he strode across the lawn,
looking around with every other step. When they reached his cabin,
Hermione turned automatically left toward the front door; Hagrid,

685
CHAPTER THIRTY
however, walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the out-
ermost edge of the forest, where he picked up a crossbow that was
leaning against a tree. When he realized they were no longer with him,
he turned.
“We’re goin’ in here,” he said, jerking his shaggy head behind him.
“Into the forest?” said Hermione, perplexed.
“Yeah,” said Hagrid. “C’mon now, quick, before we’re spotted!”
Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then ducked into the
cover of the trees behind Hagrid, who was already striding away from
them into the green gloom, his crossbow over his arm. Harry and
Hermione ran to catch up with him.
“Hagrid, why are you armed?” said Harry.
“Jus’ a precaution,” said Hagrid, shrugging his massive shoulders.
“You didn’t bring your crossbow the day you showed us the thes-
trals,” said Hermione timidly.
“Nah, well, we weren’ goin’ in so far then,” said Hagrid. “An’ any-
way, tha’ was before Firenze left the forest, wasn’ it?”
“Why does Firenze leaving make a difference?” asked Hermione
curiously.
“ ’Cause the other centaurs are good an’ riled at me, tha’s why,” said
Hagrid quietly, glancing around. “They used ter be — well, yeh
couldn’ call ’em friendly — but we got on all righ’. Kept ’emselves to
’emselves, bu’ always turned up if I wanted a word. Not anymore . . .”
He sighed deeply.
“Firenze said that they’re angry because he went to work for Dum-
bledore?” Harry asked, tripping on a protruding root because he was
busy watching Hagrid’s profile.
“Yeah,” said Hagrid heavily. “Well, angry doesn’ cover it. Ruddy
livid. If I hadn’ stepped in, I reckon they’d’ve kicked Firenze ter
death —”
“They attacked him?” said Hermione, sounding shocked.

“Yep,” said Hagrid gruffly, forcing his way through several low-
hanging branches. “He had half the herd onto him —”
“And you stopped it?” said Harry, amazed and impressed. “By
yourself?”
“ ’Course I did, couldn’t stand by an’ watch ’em kill him, could I?”
said Hagrid. “Lucky I was passin’, really . . . an’ I’d’ve thought Firenze
mighta remembered tha’ before he started sendin’ me stupid warnin’s!”
he added hotly and unexpectedly.
Harry and Hermione looked at each other, startled, but Hagrid,
scowling, did not elaborate.
“Anyway,” he said, breathing a little more heavily than usual, “since
then the other centaurs’ve bin livid with me an’ the trouble is, they’ve
got a lot of influence in the forest. . . . Cleverest creatures in here . . .”
“Is that why we’re here, Hagrid?” asked Hermione. “The centaurs?”
“Ah no,” said Hagrid, shaking his head dismissively, “no, it’s not
them. . . . Well, o’ course, they could complicate the problem, yeah.
. . . But yeh’ll see what I mean in a bit. . . .”
On this incomprehensible note he fell silent and forged a little
ahead, taking one stride for every three of theirs, so that they had great
trouble keeping up with him.
The path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew
so closely together as they walked farther and farther into the forest
that it was as dark as dusk. They were soon a long way past the clear-
ing where Hagrid had shown them the thestrals, but Harry felt no
sense of unease until Hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and
began wending his way in and out of trees toward the dark heart of
the forest.
“Hagrid?” said Harry, fighting his way through thickly knotted
brambles over which Hagrid had stepped easily and remembering
very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasions he had
stepped off the forest path. “Where are we going?”

687
CHAPTER THIRTY
“Bit further,” said Hagrid over his shoulder. “C’mon, Harry. . . .
We need ter keep together now. . . .”
It was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid, what with branches
and thickets of thorn through which Hagrid marched as easily as
though they were cobwebs, but which snagged Harry and Hermione’s
robes, frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for
minutes at a time to free themselves. Harry’s arms and legs were soon
covered in small cuts and scratches. They were so deep in the forest
now that sometimes all Harry could see of Hagrid in the gloom was a
massive dark shape ahead of him. Any sound seemed threatening in the
muffled silence. The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest
rustle of movement, though it might have been made by an innocent
sparrow, caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit. It
occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the for-
est without meeting some kind of creature — their absence struck him
as rather ominous.
“Hagrid, would it be all right if we lit our wands?” said Hermione
quietly.
“Er . . . all righ’,” Hagrid whispered back. “In fact . . .”
He stopped suddenly and turned around; Hermione walked right
into him and was knocked over backward. Harry caught her just be-
fore she hit the forest floor.
“Maybe we bes’ jus’ stop fer a momen’, so I can . . . fill yeh in,” said
Hagrid. “Before we ge’ there, like.”
“Good!” said Hermione, as Harry set her back on her feet. They
both murmured “Lumos!” and their wand tips ignited. Hagrid’s face
swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and
Harry saw that he looked nervous and sad again.
“Righ,” said Hagrid. “Well . . . see . . . the thing is . . .”
He took a great breath.
“Well, there’s a good chance I’m goin’ ter be gettin’ the sack any day
now,” he said.


Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then back at him.
“But you’ve lasted this long —” Hermione said tentatively. “What
makes you think —”
“Umbridge reckons it was me that put tha’ niffler in her office.”
“And was it?” said Harry, before he could stop himself.
“No, it ruddy well wasn’!” said Hagrid indignantly. “On’y anythin’
ter do with magical creatures an’ she thinks it’s got somethin’ ter do
with me. Yeh know she’s bin lookin’ fer a chance ter get rid of me ever
since I got back. I don’ wan’ ter go, o’ course, but if it wasn’ fer . . .
well . . . the special circumstances I’m abou’ ter explain to yeh, I’d
leave righ now, before she’s go’ the chance ter do it in front o’ the
whole school, like she did with Trelawney.”
Harry and Hermione both made noises of protest, but Hagrid
overrode them with a wave of one of his enormous hands.
“It’s not the end o’ the world, I’ll be able ter help Dumbledore once
I’m outta here, I can be useful ter the Order. An’ you lot’ll have
Grubbly-Plank, yeh’ll — yeh’ll get through yer exams fine. . . .” His
voice trembled and broke.
“Don’ worry abou’ me,” he said hastily, as Hermione made to pat
his arm. He pulled his enormous spotted handkerchief from the
pocket of his waistcoat and mopped his eyes with it. “Look, I wouldn’
be tellin’ yer this at all if I didn’ have ter. See, if I go . . . well, I can’
leave withou’ . . . withou’ tellin’ someone . . . because I’ll — I’ll need
you two ter help me. An’ Ron, if he’s willin’.”
“Of course we’ll help you,” said Harry at once. “What do you want
us to do?”
Hagrid gave a great sniff and patted Harry wordlessly on the shoul-
der with such force that Harry was knocked sideways into a tree.
“I knew yeh’d say yes,” said Hagrid into his handkerchief, “but I
won’ . . . never . . . forget . . . Well . . . c’mon . . . jus’ a little bit fur-
ther through here . . . Watch yerselves, now, there’s nettles. . . .”
They walked on in silence for another fifteen minutes. Harry had

689
CHAPTER THIRTY
opened his mouth to ask how much farther they had to go when Ha-
grid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop.
“Really easy,” he said softly. “Very quiet, now . . .”
They crept forward and Harry saw that they were facing a large,
smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as Hagrid that he thought, with
a jolt of dread, was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal. Trees
had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound, so that it stood
on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs
that formed a kind of fence or barricade, behind which Harry,
Hermione, and Hagrid now stood.
“Sleepin’,” breathed Hagrid.
Sure enough, Harry could hear a distant, rhythmic rumbling that
sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work. He glanced sideways
at Hermione, who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly
open. She looked utterly terrified.
“Hagrid,” she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the
sleeping creature, “who is he?”
Harry found this an odd question. . . . “What is it?” was the one he
had been planning on asking.
“Hagrid, you told us,” said Hermione, her wand now shaking in
her hand, “you told us none of them wanted to come!”
Harry looked from her to Hagrid and then, as realization hit him,
he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror.
The great mound of earth, on which he, Hermione, and Hagrid
could easily have stood, was moving slowly up and down in time with
the deep, grunting breathing. It was not a mound at all. It was the
curved back of what was clearly . . .
“Well — no — he didn’ want ter come,” said Hagrid, sounding
desperate. “But I had ter bring him, Hermione, I had ter!”
“But why?” asked Hermione, who sounded as though she wanted
to cry. “Why — what — oh, Hagrid !”
“I knew if I jus’ got him back,” said Hagrid, sounding close to tears


GRAWP
himself, “an’ — an’ taught him a few manners — I’d be able ter take
him outside an’ show ev’ryone he’s harmless!”
“Harmless!” said Hermione shrilly, and Hagrid made frantic hush-
ing noises with his hands as the enormous creature before them
grunted loudly and shifted in its sleep. “He’s been hurting you all this
time, hasn’t he? That’s why you’ve had all these injuries!”
“He don’ know his own strength!” said Hagrid earnestly. “An’ he’s
gettin’ better, he’s not fightin’ so much anymore —”
“So this is why it took you two months to get home!” said
Hermione distractedly. “Oh Hagrid, why did you bring him back if
he didn’t want to come, wouldn’t he have been happier with his own
people?”
“They were all bullyin’ him, Hermione, ’cause he’s so small!” said
Hagrid.
“Small?” said Hermione. “Small ?”
“Hermione, I couldn’ leave him,” said Hagrid, tears now trickling
down his bruised face into his beard. “See — he’s my brother!”
Hermione simply stared at him, her mouth open.
“Hagrid, when you say ‘brother,’ ” said Harry slowly, “do you
mean — ?”
“Well — half-brother,” amended Hagrid. “Turns out me mother
took up with another giant when she left me dad, an’ she went an’ had
Grawp here —”
“Grawp?” said Harry.
“Yeah . . . well, tha’s what it sounds like when he says his name,”
said Hagrid anxiously. “He don’ speak a lot of English. . . . I’ve bin
tryin’ ter teach him. . . . Anyway, she don’ seem ter have liked him
much more’n she liked me. . . . See, with giantesses, what counts is
producin’ good big kids, and he’s always been a bit on the runty side
fer a giant — on’y sixteen foot —”
“Oh yes, tiny!” said Hermione, with a kind of hysterical sarcasm.
“Absolutely minuscule!”


CHAPTER THIRTY
“He was bein’ kicked around by all o’ them — I jus’ couldn’ leave
him —”
“Did Madame Maxime want to bring him back?” asked Harry.
“She — well, she could see it was right importan’ ter me,” said Ha-
grid, twisting his enormous hands. “Bu’ — bu’ she got a bit tired of
him after a while, I must admit . . . so we split up on the journey
home. . . . She promised not ter tell anyone though. . . .”
“How on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing?”
said Harry.
“Well, tha’s why it took so long, see,” said Hagrid. “Could on’y
travel by nigh an’ through wild country an’ stuff. ’Course, he covers
the ground pretty well when he wants ter, but he kep’ wantin’ ter go
back. . . .”
“Oh Hagrid, why on earth didn’t you let him!” said Hermione,
flopping down onto a ripped-up tree and burying her face in her
hands. “What do you think you’re going to do with a violent giant
who doesn’t even want to be here!”
“Well, now — ‘violent’ — tha’s a bit harsh,” said Hagrid, still
twisting his hands agitatedly. “I’ll admit he mighta taken a couple o’
swings at me when he’s bin in a bad mood, but he’s gettin’ better, loads
better, settlin’ down well. . . .”
“What are those ropes for, then?” Harry asked.
He had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around
the trunks of the largest nearby trees toward the place where Grawp
lay curled on the ground with his back to them.
“You have to keep him tied up?” said Hermione faintly.
“Well . . . yeah . . .” said Hagrid, looking anxious. “See — it’s like I
say — he doesn’ really know his strength —”
Harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack
of any other living creature in this part of the forest.
“So what is it you want Harry and Ron and me to do?” Hermione
asked apprehensively.

692
GRAWP
“Look after him,” said Hagrid croakily. “After I’m gone.”
Harry and Hermione exchanged miserable looks, Harry uncom-
fortably aware that he had already promised Hagrid that he would do
whatever he asked.
“What — what does that involve, exactly?” Hermione inquired.
“Not food or anythin’!” said Hagrid eagerly. “He can get his own
food, no problem. Birds an’ deer an’ stuff . . . No, it’s company he
needs. If I jus’ knew someone was carryin’ on tryin’ ter help him a bit
. . . teachin’ him, yeh know . . .”
Harry said nothing, but turned to look back at the gigantic form
lying asleep on the ground in front of them. Grawp had his back to
them. Unlike Hagrid, who simply looked like a very oversize hu-
man, Grawp looked strangely misshapen. What Harry had taken to
be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he
now recognized as Grawp’s head. It was much larger in proportion to
the body than a human head, almost perfectly round and covered
with tightly curling, close-growing hair the color of bracken. The
rim of a single large, fleshy ear was visible on top of the head, which
seemed to sit, rather like Uncle Vernon’s, directly upon the shoulders
with little or no neck in between. The back, under what looked like
a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly to-
gether, was very broad, and as Grawp slept, it seemed to strain a lit-
tle at the rough seams of the skins. The legs were curled up under
the body; Harry could see the soles of enormous, filthy, bare feet,
large as sledges, resting one on top of the other on the earthy forest
floor.
“You want us to teach him,” Harry said in a hollow voice. He now
understood what Firenze’s warning had meant. His attempt is not work-
ing. He would do better to abandon it. Of course, the other creatures
who lived in the forest would have heard Hagrid’s fruitless attempts to
teach Grawp English. . . .
“Yeah — even if yeh jus’ talk ter him a bit,” said Hagrid hopefully.

693
CHAPTER THIRTY
“ ’Cause I reckon, if he can talk ter people, he’ll understand more that
we all like him really, an’ want him to stay. . . .”
Harry looked at Hermione, who peered back at him from between
the fingers over her face.
“Kind of makes you wish we had Norbert back, doesn’t it?” he said
and she gave a very shaky laugh.
“Yeh’ll do it, then?” said Hagrid, who did not seem to have caught
what Harry had just said.
“We’ll . . .” said Harry, already bound by his promise. “We’ll try,
Hagrid. . . .”
“I knew I could count on yeh, Harry,” Hagrid said, beaming in a
very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief again.
“An’ I don’ wan’ yeh ter put yerself out too much, like. . . . I know
yeh’ve got exams. . . . If yeh could jus’ nip down here in yer Invisibil-
ity Cloak maybe once a week an’ have a little chat with him . . . I’ll
wake him up, then — introduce you —”
“Wha — no!” said Hermione, jumping up, “Hagrid, no, don’t
wake him, really, we don’t need —”
But Hagrid had already stepped over the great trunk in front of
them and was proceeding toward Grawp. When he was around ten
feet away, he lifted a long, broken bough from the ground, smiled re-
assuringly over his shoulder at Harry and Hermione, and then poked
Grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough.
The giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent forest. Birds in
the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared
away. In front of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp
was rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed an enor-
mous hand upon it to push himself onto his knees and turned his head
to see who and what had disturbed him.
“All righ’, Grawpy?” said Hagrid in a would-be cheery voice, back-
ing away with the long bough raised, ready to poke Grawp again.
“Had a nice sleep, eh?”

694
GRAWP
Harry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keep-
ing the giant within their sights. Grawp knelt between two trees he
had not yet uprooted. They looked up into his startlingly huge face,
which resembled a gray full moon swimming in the gloom of the
clearing. It was as though the features had been hewn onto a great
stone ball. The nose was stubby and shapeless, the mouth lopsided
and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks. The small
eyes were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were half gummed
together with sleep. Grawp raised dirty knuckles as big as cricket balls
to his eyes, rubbed vigorously, then, without warning, pushed himself
to his feet with surprising speed and agility.
“Oh my . . .” Harry heard Hermione squeal, terrified, beside him.
The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp’s
wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously. He was, as Hagrid
had said, at least sixteen feet tall. Gazing blearily around, he reached
out a hand the size of a beach umbrella, seized a bird’s nest from the
upper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside down with a
roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it — eggs fell
like grenades toward the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his
head to protect himself.
“Anyway, Grawpy,” shouted Hagrid, looking up apprehensively in
case of further falling eggs, “I’ve brought some friends ter meet yeh.
Remember, I told yeh I might? Remember, when I said I might have
ter go on a little trip an’ leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit? Re-
member that, Grawpy?”
But Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard to say
whether he was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognized the
sounds Hagrid was making as speech. He had now seized the top of
the pine tree and was pulling it toward him, evidently for the simple
pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go.
“Now, Grawpy, don’ do that!” shouted Hagrid. “Tha’s how you
ended up pullin’ up the others —”

695
CHAPTER THIRTY
And sure enough, Harry could see the earth around the tree’s roots
beginning to crack.
“I got company fer yeh!” Hagrid shouted. “Company, see! Look
down, yeh big buffoon, I brought yeh some friends!”
“Oh Hagrid, don’t,” moaned Hermione, but Hagrid had already
raised the bough again and gave Grawp’s knee a sharp poke.
The giant let go of the top of the pine tree, which swayed menac-
ingly and deluged Hagrid with a rain of needles, and looked down.
“This,” said Hagrid, hastening over to where Harry and Hermione
stood, “is Harry, Grawp! Harry Potter! He migh’ be comin’ ter visit
yeh if I have ter go away, understand?”
The giant had only just realized that Harry and Hermione were
there. They watched, in great trepidation, as he lowered his huge boul-
der of a head so that he could peer blearily at them.
“An’ this is Hermione, see? Her —” Hagrid hesitated. Turning to
Hermione he said, “Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy, Hermi-
one? On’y it’s a difficult name fer him ter remember. . . .”
“No, not at all,” squeaked Hermione.
“This is Hermy, Grawp! An’ she’s gonna be comin’ an’ all! Is’n tha’
nice? Eh? Two friends fer yeh ter — GRAWPY, NO!”
Grawp’s hand had shot out of nowhere toward Hermione — Harry
seized her and pulled her backward behind the tree, so that Grawp’s
fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air.
“BAD BOY, GRAWPY!” Harry heard Hagrid yelling, as Hermione
clung to Harry behind the tree, shaking and whimpering. “VERY
BAD BOY! YEH DON’ GRAB — OUCH!”
Harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw Hagrid
lying on his back, his hand over his nose. Grawp, apparently losing in-
terest, had straightened up again and was again engaged in pulling
back the pine as far as it would go.
“Righ’,” said Hagrid thickly, getting up with one hand pinching his

696
GRAWP
bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow. “Well . . . there
yeh are. . . . Yeh’ve met him an’ — an’ now he’ll know yeh when yeh
come back. Yeah . . . well . . .”
He looked up at Grawp, who was now pulling back the pine with
an expression of detached pleasure on his boulderish face; the roots
were creaking as he ripped them away from the ground. . . .
“Well, I reckon tha’s enough fer one day,” said Hagrid. “We’ll —
er — we’ll go back now, shall we?”
Harry and Hermione nodded. Hagrid shouldered his crossbow
again and, still pinching his nose, led the way back into the trees.
Nobody spoke for a while, not even when they heard the distant
crash that meant Grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last.
Hermione’s face was pale and set. Harry could not think of a single
thing to say. What on earth was going to happen when somebody
found out that Hagrid had hidden Grawp in the forest? And he had
promised that he, Ron, and Hermione would continue Hagrid’s to-
tally pointless attempts to civilize the giant. . . . How could Hagrid,
even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged mon-
sters were lovably harmless, fool himself that Grawp would ever be fit
to mix with humans?
“Hold it,” said Hagrid abruptly, just as Harry and Hermione were
struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him. He pulled
an arrow out of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the
crossbow. Harry and Hermione raised their wands; now that they had
stopped walking, they too could hear movement close by.
“Oh blimey,” said Hagrid quietly.
“I thought that we told you, Hagrid,” said a deep male voice, “that
you are no longer welcome here?”
A man’s naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating toward
them through the dappled green half-light. Then they saw that his
waist joined smoothly with a horse’s chestnut body. This centaur had

697
CHAPTER THIRTY
a proud, high-cheekboned face and long black hair. Like Hagrid, he
was armed: A quiverful of arrows and a long bow were slung over his
shoulders.
“How are yeh, Magorian?” said Hagrid warily.
The trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more emerged
behind him. Harry recognized the black-bodied and bearded Bane,
whom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met
Firenze. Bane gave no sign that he had ever seen Harry before.
“So,” he said, with a nasty inflection in his voice, before turning
immediately to Magorian. “We agreed, I think, what we would do if
this human showed his face in the forest again?”
“ ‘This human’ now, am I?” said Hagrid testily. “Jus’ fer stoppin’ all
of yeh committin’ murder?”
“You ought not to have meddled, Hagrid,” said Magorian. “Our
ways are not yours, nor are our laws. Firenze has betrayed and dis-
honored us.”
“I dunno how yeh work that out,” said Hagrid impatiently. “He’s
done nothin’ except help Albus Dumbledore —”
“Firenze has entered into servitude to humans,” said a gray centaur
with a hard, deeply lined face.
“Servitude!” said Hagrid scathingly. “He’s doin’ Dumbledore a favor
is all —”
“He is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans,” said
Magorian quietly. “There can be no return from such disgrace.”
“If yeh say so,” said Hagrid, shrugging, “but personally I think
yeh’re makin’ a big mistake —”
“As are you, human,” said Bane, “coming back into our forest when
we warned you —”
“Now, you listen ter me,” said Hagrid angrily. “I’ll have less of the
‘our’ forest, if it’s all the same ter you. It’s not up ter you who comes
an’ goes in here —”

698
GRAWP
“No more is it up to you, Hagrid,” said Magorian smoothly. “I shall
let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young —”
“They’re not his!” interrupted Bane contemptuously. “Students,
Magorian, from up at the school! They have probably already profited
from the traitor Firenze’s teachings. . . .”
“Nevertheless,” said Magorian calmly, “the slaughter of foals is a
terrible crime. . . . We do not touch the innocent. Today, Hagrid, you
pass. Henceforth, stay away from this place. You forfeited the friend-
ship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor Firenze escape us.”
“I won’ be kept outta the fores’ by a bunch of mules like you!” said
Hagrid loudly.
“Hagrid,” said Hermione in a high-pitched and terrified voice, as
both Bane and the gray centaur pawed at the ground, “let’s go, please
lets go!
Hagrid moved forward, but his crossbow was still raised and his
eyes were still fixed threateningly upon Magorian.
“We know what you are keeping in the forest, Hagrid!” Magorian
called after them, as the centaurs slipped out of sight. “And our toler-
ance is waning!”
Hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk
straight back to Magorian again.
“You’ll tolerate him as long as he’s here, it’s as much his forest as
yours!” he yelled, while Harry and Hermione both pushed with all
their might against Hagrid’s moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep
him moving forward. Still scowling, he looked down; his expression
changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him. He
seemed not to have felt it.
“Calm down, you two,” he said, turning to walk on while they
panted along behind him. “Ruddy old nags though, eh?”
“Hagrid,” said Hermione breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles
they had passed on their way there, “if the centaurs don’t want

699
CHAPTER THIRTY
humans in the forest, it doesn’t really look as though Harry and I will
be able —”
“Ah, you heard what they said,” said Hagrid dismissively “They
wouldn’t hurt foals — I mean, kids. Anyway, we can’ let ourselves be
pushed around by that lot. . . .”
“Nice try,” Harry murmured to Hermione, who looked crestfallen.
At last they rejoined the path and after another ten minutes, the
trees began to thin. They were able to see patches of clear blue sky
again and hear, in the distance, the definite sounds of cheering and
shouting.
“Was that another goal?” asked Hagrid, pausing in the shelter of
the trees as the Quidditch stadium came into view. “Or d’you reckon
the match is over?”
“I don’t know,” said Hermione miserably. Harry saw that she looked
much the worse for wear; her hair was full of bits of twig and leaves,
her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous
scratches on her face and arms. He knew he could look little better.
“I reckon it’s over, yeh know!” said Hagrid, still squinting toward
the stadium. “Look — there’s people comin’ out already — if you two
hurry yeh’ll be able ter blend in with the crowd an’ no one’ll know you
weren’t there!”
“Good idea,” said Harry. “Well . . . see you later, then, Hagrid. . . .”
“I don’t believe him,” said Hermione in a very unsteady voice, the
moment they were out of earshot of Hagrid. “I don’t believe him. I
really don’t believe him. . . .”
“Calm down,” said Harry.
“Calm down!” she said feverishly. “A giant! A giant in the forest!
And we’re supposed to give him English lessons! Always assuming, of
course, we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in
and out! I — don’t — believe — him!”
“We haven’t got to do anything yet!” Harry tried to reassure her in

700
GRAWP
a quiet voice, as they joined a stream of jabbering Hufflepuffs heading
back toward the castle. “He’s not asking us to do anything unless he
gets chucked out and that might not even happen —”
“Oh come off it, Harry!” said Hermione angrily, stopping dead in
her tracks so that the people behind her had to swerve to avoid her.
“Of course he’s going to be chucked out and to be perfectly honest, af-
ter what we’ve just seen, who can blame Umbridge?”
There was a pause in which Harry glared at her, and her eyes filled
slowly with tears.
“You didn’t mean that,” said Harry quietly.
“No . . . well . . . all right . . . I didn’t,” she said, wiping her eyes
angrily. “But why does he have to make life so difficult for himself —
for us?”
“I dunno —”
Weasley is our King,
Weasley is our King,
He didn’t let the Quaffle in,
Weasley is our King . . .
“And I wish they’d stop singing that stupid song,” said Hermione
miserably, “haven’t they gloated enough?”
A great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the
pitch.
“Oh, let’s get in before we have to meet the Slytherins,” said
Hermione.
Weasley can save anything,
He never leaves a single ring
That’s why Gryffindors all sing:
Weasley is our King.

CHAPTER THIRTY
“Hermione . . .” said Harry slowly.
The song was growing louder, but it was issuing not from a crowd
of green-and-silver-clad Slytherins, but from a mass of red and gold
moving slowly toward the castle, which was bearing a solitary figure
upon its many shoulders. . . .
Weasley is our King,
Weasley is our King,
He didn’t let the Quaffle in,
Weasley is our King . . .
“No!” said Hermione in a hushed voice.
“YES!” said Harry loudly.
“HARRY! HERMIONE!” yelled Ron, waving the silver Quidditch
Cup in the air and looking quite beside himself. “WE DID IT! WE
WON!”
They beamed up at him as he passed; there was a scrum at the door
of the castle and Ron’s head got rather badly bumped on the lintel, but
nobody seemed to want to put him down. Still singing, the crowd
squeezed itself into the entrance hall and out of sight. Harry and
Hermione watched them go, beaming, until the last echoing strains of
“Weasley Is Our King” died away. Then they turned to each other,
their smiles fading.
“We’ll save our news till tomorrow, shall we?” said Harry.
“Yes, all right,” said Hermione wearily. “I’m not in any hurry. . . .”
They climbed the steps together. At the front doors both instinc-
tively looked back at the Forbidden Forest. Harry was not sure
whether it was his imagination or not, but he rather thought he saw a
small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the treetops in the dis-
tance, almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had
just been pulled up by the roots.

R
on’s euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch Cup
was such that he could not settle to anything next day. All he
wanted to do was talk over the match and Harry and Hermione found
it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp — not
that either of them tried very hard; neither was keen to be the one to
bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion. As it was an-
other fine, warm day, they persuaded him to join them in studying
under the beech tree on the edge of the lake, where they stood less
chance of being overheard than in the common room. Ron was not
particularly keen on this idea at first; he was thoroughly enjoying be-
ing patted on the back by Gryffindors walking past his chair, not to
mention the occasional outbursts of “Weasley Is Our King,” but
agreed after a while that some fresh air might do him good.
They spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat
down while Ron talked them through his first save of the match for
what felt like the dozenth time.
“Well, I mean, I’d already let in that one of Davies’s, so I wasn’t feel-
ing that confident, but I dunno, when Bradley came toward me, just

out of nowhere, I thought — you can do this! And I had about a sec-
ond to decide which way to fly, you know, because he looked like he
was aiming for the right goal hoop — my right, obviously, his left —
but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting, and so I took the
chance and flew left — his right, I mean — and — well — you saw
what happened,” he concluded modestly, sweeping his hair back quite
unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing
around to see whether the people nearest to them — a bunch of gos-
siping third-year Hufflepuffs — had heard him. “And then, when
Chambers came at me about five minutes later — what?” Ron said,
stopping mid-sentence at the look on Harry’s face. “Why are you
grinning?”
“I’m not,” said Harry quickly, looking down at his Transfiguration
notes and attempting to straighten his face. The truth was that Ron
had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch
player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree. “I’m
just glad we won, that’s all.”
“Yeah,” said Ron slowly, savoring the words, “we won. Did you see
the look on Chang’s face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from
under her nose?”
“I suppose she cried, did she?” said Harry bitterly.
“Well, yeah — more out of temper than anything, though . . .”
Ron frowned slightly. “But you saw her chuck her broom away when
she got back to the ground, didn’t you?”
“Er —” said Harry.
“Well, actually . . . no, Ron,” said Hermione with a heavy sigh,
putting down her book and looking at him apologetically. “As a mat-
ter of fact, the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies’s first
goal.”
Ron’s carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment.
“You didn’t watch?” he said faintly, looking from one to the other.
“You didn’t see me make any of those saves?”

704
O.W.L.S
“Well — no,” said Hermione, stretching out a placatory hand to-
ward him. “But Ron, we didn’t want to leave — we had to!”
“Yeah?” said Ron, whose face was growing rather red. “How come?”
“It was Hagrid,” said Harry. “He decided to tell us why he’s been
covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants. He wanted
us to go into the forest with him, we had no choice, you know how he
gets. . . . Anyway . . .”
The story was told in five minutes, by the end of which Ron’s in-
dignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity.
“He brought one back and hid it in the forest?”
“Yep,” said Harry grimly.
“No,” said Ron, as though by saying this he could make it untrue.
“No, he can’t have. . . .”
“Well, he has,” said Hermione firmly. “Grawp’s about sixteen feet
tall, enjoys ripping up twenty-foot pine trees, and knows me,” she
snorted, “as Hermy.”
Ron gave a nervous laugh.
“And Hagrid wants us to . . . ?”
“Teach him English, yeah,” said Harry.
“He’s lost his mind,” said Ron in an almost awed voice.
“Yes,” said Hermione irritably, turning a page of Intermediate
Transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl
turning into a pair of opera glasses. “Yes, I’m starting to think he has.
But unfortunately, he made Harry and me promise.”
“Well, you’re just going to have to break your promise, that’s all,”
said Ron firmly. “I mean, come on . . . We’ve got exams and we’re
about that far,” he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger a
millimeter apart, “from being chucked out as it is. And anyway . . . re-
member Norbert? Remember Aragog? Have we ever come off better
for mixing with any of Hagrid’s monster mates?”
“I know, it’s just that — we promised,” said Hermione in a small
voice.


CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
Ron smoothed his hair flat again, looking preoccupied.
“Well,” he sighed, “Hagrid hasn’t been sacked yet, has he? He’s
hung on this long, maybe he’ll hang on till the end of term and we
won’t have to go near Grawp at all.”
The castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly
painted; the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling
lake, the satin-green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze: June
had arrived, but to the fifth years this meant only one thing: Their
O.W.L.s were upon them at last.
Their teachers were no longer setting them homework; lessons
were devoted to reviewing those topics their teachers thought most
likely to come up in the exams. The purposeful, feverish atmosphere
drove nearly everything but the O.W.L.s from Harry’s mind, though
he did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had
ever told Snape that he must continue giving Harry Occlumency
tuition: If he had, then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he
was now ignoring Harry. This suited Harry very well; he was quite
busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape, and to his re-
lief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him
about Occlumency. She was spending a lot of time muttering to her-
self and had not laid out any elf clothes for days.
She was not the only person acting oddly as the O.W.L.s drew
steadily nearer. Ernie Macmillan had developed an irritating habit of
interrogating people about their study habits.
“How many hours d’you think you’re doing a day?” he demanded
of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam
in his eyes.
“I dunno,” said Ron. “A few . . .”
“More or less than eight?”
“Less, I s’pose,” said Ron, looking slightly alarmed.
“I’m doing eight,” said Ernie, puffing out his chest. “Eight or nine.

706
O.W.L.S
I’m getting an hour in before breakfast every day. Eight’s my average.
I can do ten on a good weekend day. I did nine and a half on Monday.
Not so good on Tuesday — only seven and a quarter. Then on
Wednesday —”
Harry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into
greenhouse three at that point, forcing Ernie to abandon his recital.
Meanwhile Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce
panic.
“Of course, it’s not what you know,” he was heard to tell Crabbe
and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to
start, “it’s who you know. Now, Father’s been friendly with the head of
the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years — old Griselda
Marchbanks — we’ve had her round for dinner and everything. . . .”
“Do you think that’s true?” Hermione whispered to Harry and
Ron, looking frightened.
“Nothing we can do about it if it is,” said Ron gloomily.
“I don’t think it’s true,” said Neville quietly from behind them.
“Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran’s, and she’s never
mentioned the Malfoys.”
“What’s she like, Neville?” asked Hermione at once. “Is she strict?”
“Bit like Gran, really,” said Neville in a subdued voice.
“Knowing her won’t hurt your chances though, will it?” Ron told
him encouragingly.
“Oh, I don’t think it will make any difference,” said Neville, still more
miserably. “Gran’s always telling Professor Marchbanks I’m not as good
as my dad. . . . Well . . . you saw what she’s like at St. Mungo’s. . . .”
Neville looked fixedly at the floor. Harry, Ron, and Hermione
glanced at one another, but didn’t know what to say. It was the first
time that Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the Wizard-
ing hospital.
Meanwhile a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concentra-
tion, mental agility, and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth


CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
and seventh years. Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle
of Baruffio’s Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth year Ed-
die Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine
“Outstanding” O.W.L.s he had gained the previous summer and was
offering the whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons. Ron assured Harry
he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts
and got a job, but before they could close the deal, Hermione had
confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents
down a toilet.
“Hermione, we wanted to buy that!” shouted Ron.
“Don’t be stupid,” she snarled. “You might as well take Harold
Dingle’s powdered dragon claw and have done with it.”
“Dingle’s got powdered dragon claw?” said Ron eagerly.
“Not anymore,” said Hermione. “I confiscated that too. None of
these things actually works you know —”
“Dragon claw does work!” said Ron. “It’s supposed to be incredible,
really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few
hours — Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, it can’t hurt —”
“This stuff can,” said Hermione grimly. “I’ve had a look at it, and
it’s actually dried doxy droppings.”
This information took the edge off Harry and Ron’s desire for brain
stimulants.
They received their examination schedules and details of the proce-
dure for O.W.L.s during their next Transfiguration lesson.
“As you can see,” Professor McGonagall told the class while they
copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard,
“your O.W.L.s are spread over two successive weeks. You will sit the
theory exams in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons.
Your practical Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at
night.
“Now, I must warn you that the most stringent Anti-Cheating
Charms have been applied to your examination papers. Auto-Answer

708
O.W.L.S
Quills are banned from the examination hall, as are Remembralls,
Detachable Cribbing Cuffs, and Self-Correcting Ink. Every year, I am
afraid to say, seems to harbor at least one student who thinks that he
or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authority’s rules.
I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor. Our new — head-
mistress” — Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the
same look on her face that Aunt Petunia had whenever she was con-
templating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt — “has asked the Heads
of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most se-
verely — because, of course, your examination results will reflect
upon the headmistress’s new regime at the school. . . .”
Professor McGonagall gave a tiny sigh. Harry saw the nostrils of
her sharp nose flare.
“However, that is no reason not to do your very best. You have your
own futures to think about.”
“Please, Professor,” said Hermione, her hand in the air, “when will
we find out our results?”
“An owl will be sent to you some time in July,” said Professor
McGonagall.
“Excellent,” said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, “so we don’t
have to worry about it till the holidays. . . .”
Harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks’
time, waiting for his O.W.L. results. Well, he thought, at least he
would be sure of one bit of post next summer. . . .
Their first exam, Theory of Charms, was scheduled for Monday
morning. Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday but
regretted it almost at once. She was very agitated and kept snatching
the book back from him to check that she had gotten the answer com-
pletely right, finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge
of Achievements in Charming.
“Why don’t you just do it yourself?” he said firmly, handing the
book back to her, his eyes watering.

709
CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
Meanwhile Ron was reading two years of Charms notes with his
fingers in his ears, his lips moving soundlessly; Seamus was lying flat
on his back on the floor, reciting the definition of a Substantive
Charm, while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells,
Grade 5; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practicing basic loco-
motion charms, were making their pencil cases race each other around
the edge of the table.
Dinner was a subdued affair that night. Harry and Ron did not talk
much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day. Hermione on
the other hand kept putting down her knife and fork and diving un-
der the table for her bag, from which she would seize a book to check
some fact or figure. Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a de-
cent meal or she would not sleep that night, when her fork slid from
her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate.
“Oh, my goodness,” she said faintly, staring into the entrance hall.
“Is that them? Is that the examiners?”
Harry and Ron whipped around on their bench. Through the
doors to the Great Hall they could see Umbridge standing with a
small group of ancient-looking witches and wizards. Umbridge,
Harry was pleased to see, looked rather nervous.
“Shall we go and have a closer look?” said Ron.
Harry and Hermione nodded and they hastened toward the double
doors into the entrance hall, slowing down as they stepped over the
threshold to walk sedately past the examiners. Harry thought Profes-
sor Marchbanks must be the tiny, stooped witch with a face so lined it
looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs; Umbridge was
speaking to her very deferentially. Professor Marchbanks seemed to be
a little deaf; she was answering Umbridge very loudly considering that
they were only a foot apart.
“Journey was fine, journey was fine, we’ve made it plenty of times
before!” she said impatiently. “Now, I haven’t heard from Dumbledore
lately!” she added, peering around the hall as though hopeful he might


O.W.L.S
suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard. “No idea where he is, I
suppose?”
“None at all,” said Umbridge, shooting a malevolent look at Harry,
Ron, and Hermione, who were now dawdling around the foot of
the stairs as Ron pretended to do up his shoelace. “But I daresay the
Ministry of Magic will track him down soon enough. . . .”
“I doubt it,” shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks, “not if Dumble-
dore doesn’t want to be found! I should know. . . . Examined him
personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did N.E.W.T.s . . .
Did things with a wand I’d never seen before . . .”
“Yes . . . well . . .” said Professor Umbridge as Harry, Ron, and
Hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they
dared, “let me show you to the staffroom . . . I daresay you’d like a cup
of tea after your journey. . . .”
It was an uncomfortable sort of an evening. Everyone was trying to
do some last-minute studying but nobody seemed to be getting very
far. Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like
hours. He remembered his careers consultation and McGonagall’s fu-
rious declaration that she would help him become an Auror if it was
the last thing she did. . . . He wished he had expressed a more achiev-
able ambition now that exam time was here. . . . He knew that he was
not the only one lying awake, but none of the others in the dormitory
spoke and finally, one by one, they fell asleep.
None of the fifth years talked very much at breakfast next day ei-
ther. Parvati was practicing incantations under her breath while the
salt cellar in front of her twitched, Hermione was rereading Achieve-
ment in Charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred, and Neville
kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade.
Once breakfast was over, the fifth and seventh years milled around
in the entrance hall while the other students went off to lessons. Then,
at half-past nine, they were called forward class by class to reenter the
Great Hall, which was now arranged exactly as Harry had seen it in

711
CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
the Pensieve when his father, Sirius, and Snape had been taking their
O.W.L.s. The four House tables had been removed and replaced in-
stead with many tables for one, all facing the staff-table end of the
Hall where Professor McGonagall stood facing them. When they were
all seated and quiet she said, “You may begin,” and turned over an
enormous hourglass on the desk beside her, on which were also spare
quills, ink bottles, and rolls of parchment.
Harry turned over his paper, his heart thumping hard. . . . Three
rows to his right and four seats ahead, Hermione was already scrib-
bling. . . . He lowered his eyes to the first question: a) Give the incanta-
tion, and b) describe the wand movement required to make objects fly. . . .
Harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and
landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll. . . . Smiling slightly, he
bent over the paper and began to write. . . .
“Well, it wasn’t too bad, was it?” asked Hermione anxiously in the en-
trance hall two hours later, still clutching the exam paper. “I’m not
sure I did myself justice on Cheering Charms, I just ran out of
time — did you put in the countercharm for hiccups? I wasn’t sure
whether I ought to, it felt like too much — and on question twenty-
three —”
“Hermione,” said Ron sternly, “we’ve been through this before. . . .
We’re not going through every exam afterward, it’s bad enough doing
them once.”
The fifth years ate lunch with the rest of the school (the four House
tables reappeared over the lunch hour) and then trooped off into the
small chamber beside the Great Hall, where they were to wait until
called for their practical examination. As small groups of students
were called forward in alphabetical order, those left behind muttered
incantations and practiced wand movements, occasionally poking one
another in the back or eye by mistake.
Hermione’s name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with

712
O.W.L.S
Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle, and Daphne Greengrass. Stu-
dents who had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry
and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.
“She’ll be fine — remember she got a hundred and twelve percent
on one of our Charms tests?” said Ron.
Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, “Parkinson, Pansy —
Patil, Padma — Patil, Parvati — Potter, Harry.”
“Good luck,” said Ron quietly. Harry walked into the Great Hall,
clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook.
“Professor Tofty is free, Potter,” squeaked Professor Flitwick, who
was standing just inside the door. He pointed Harry toward what
looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner, who was sitting be-
hind a small table in a far corner, a short distance from Professor
Marchbanks, who was halfway through testing Draco Malfoy.
“Potter, is it?” said Professor Tofty, consulting his notes and peering
over his pince-nez at Harry as he approached. “The famous Potter?”
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry distinctly saw Malfoy throw a
scathing look over at him; the wine glass Malfoy had been levitating
fell to the floor and smashed. Harry could not suppress a grin. Profes-
sor Tofty smiled back at him encouragingly.
“That’s it,” he said in his quavery old voice, “no need to be nervous.
. . . Now, if I could ask you to take this eggcup and make it do some
cartwheels for me. . . .”
On the whole Harry thought it went rather well; his Levitation
Charm was certainly much better than Malfoy’s had been, though he
wished he had not mixed up the incantations for Color-Change and
Growth Charms, so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange
swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before Harry could
rectify his mistake. He was glad Hermione had not been in the Hall at
the time and neglected to mention it to her afterward. He could tell
Ron, though; Ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large
mushroom and had no idea how it had happened.

713
CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
There was no time to relax that night — they went straight to the
common room after dinner and submerged themselves in studying for
Transfiguration next day. Harry went to bed, his head buzzing with
complex spell models and theories.
He forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his written
exam next morning, but thought his practical could have been a lot
worse. At least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana, whereas
poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and
somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos,
causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds
were captured and carried out of the Hall.
They had their Herbology exam on Wednesday (other than a small
bite from a Fanged Geranium, Harry felt he had done reasonably
well) and then, on Thursday, Defense Against the Dark Arts. Here, for
the first time, Harry felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with
any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the
practical examination, in performing all the counterjinxes and defen-
sive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from
near the doors into the entrance hall.
“Oh bravo!” cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again,
when Harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. “Very
good indeed! Well, I think that’s all, Potter . . . unless . . .”
He leaned forward a little.
“I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can pro-
duce a Patronus? For a bonus point . . . ?”
Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge, and imagined
her being sacked.
“Expecto Patronum!”
The silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the
length of the hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its
progress and when it dissolved into silver mist, Professor Tofty
clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically.

714
O.W.L.S
“Excellent!” he said. “Very well, Potter, you may go!”
As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door their eyes met. There
was a nasty smile playing around her wide, slack mouth, but he did
not care. Unless he was very much mistaken (and he was not planning
on saying it to anybody, in case he was), he had just achieved an “Out-
standing” O.W.L.
On Friday, Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat
her Ancient Runes exam, and as they had the whole weekend in front
of them, they permitted themselves a break from studying. They
stretched and yawned beside the open window, through which warm
summer air wafted over them as they played a desultory game of wiz-
ard chess. Harry could see Hagrid in the distance, teaching a class on
the edge of the forest. He was trying to guess what creatures they were
examining — he thought it must be unicorns, because the boys
seemed to be standing back a little — when the portrait hole opened
and Hermione clambered in, looking thoroughly bad tempered.
“How were the runes?” said Ron, yawning and stretching.
“I mistranslated ‘ehwaz,’ ” said Hermione furiously. “It means ‘part-
nership,’ not ‘defense,’ I mixed it up with ‘eihwaz.’ ”
“Ah well,” said Ron lazily, “that’s only one mistake, isn’t it, you’ll
still get —”
“Oh shut up,” said Hermione angrily, “it could be the one mistake
that makes the difference between a pass and a fail. And what’s more,
someone’s put another niffler in Umbridge’s office, I don’t know how
they got it through that new door, but I just walked past there and
Umbridge is shrieking her head off — by the sound of it, it tried to
take a chunk out of her leg —”
“Good,” said Harry and Ron together.
“It is not good!” said Hermione hotly. “She thinks it’s Hagrid doing
it, remember? And we do not want Hagrid chucked out!”
“He’s teaching at the moment, she can’t blame him,” said Harry,
gesturing out of the window.

715
CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
“Oh, you’re so naive sometimes, Harry, you really think Umbridge
will wait for proof?” said Hermione, who seemed determined to be in
a towering temper, and she swept off toward the girls’ dormitories,
banging the door behind her.
“Such a lovely, sweet-tempered girl,” said Ron, very quietly, prod-
ding his queen forward so that she could begin beating up one of
Harry’s knights.
Hermione’s bad mood persisted for most of the weekend, though
Harry and Ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of
Saturday and Sunday studying for Potions on Monday, the exam to
which Harry was looking forward least and which he was sure would
be the one that would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an
Auror. Sure enough, he found the written exam difficult, though he
thought he might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice
Potion: He could describe its effects extremely accurately, having
taken it illegally in his second year.
The afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected it to
be. With Snape absent from the proceedings he found that he was
much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions. Neville,
who was sitting very near Harry, also looked happier than Harry had
ever seen him during a Potions class. When Professor Marchbanks
said, “Step away from your cauldrons, please, the examination is over,”
Harry corked his sample flask feeling that he might not have achieved
a good grade but that he had, with luck, avoided a fail.
“Only four exams left,” said Parvati Patil wearily as they headed
back to Gryffindor common room.
“Only!” said Hermione snappishly. “I’ve got Arithmancy and it’s
probably the toughest subject there is!”
Nobody was foolish enough to snap back, so she was unable to vent
her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some first
years for giggling too loudly in the common room.

716
O.W.L.S
Harry was determined to perform well in Tuesday’s Care of Magi-
cal Creatures exam so as not to let Hagrid down. The practical exam-
ination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the
Forbidden Forest, where students were required to correctly identify
the knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs (the trick was to offer
them all milk in turn: knarls, highly suspicious creatures whose quills
had many magical properties, generally went berserk at what they saw
as an attempt to poison them); then demonstrate correct handling of
a bowtruckle, feed and clean a fire-crab without sustaining serious
burns, and choose, from a wide selection of food, the diet they would
give a sick unicorn.
Harry could see Hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin win-
dow. When Harry’s examiner, a plump little witch this time, smiled at
him and told him he could leave, Harry gave Hagrid a fleeting
thumbs-up before heading back up to the castle.
The Astronomy theory exam on Wednesday morning went well
enough; Harry was not convinced he had got the names of all of
Jupiter’s moons right, but was at least confident that none of them was
inhabited by mice. They had to wait until evening for their practical
Astronomy; the afternoon was devoted instead to Divination.
Even by Harry’s low standards in Divination, the exam went very
badly. He might as well have tried to see moving pictures in the desk-
top as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball; he lost his head completely
during tea-leaf reading, saying it looked to him as though Professor
Marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round, dark, soggy stranger,
and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines
on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previ-
ous Tuesday.
“Well, we were always going to fail that one,” said Ron gloomily as
they ascended the marble staircase. He had just made Harry feel
rather better by telling him how he told the examiner in detail about

717

the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball, only to look
up and realize he had been describing his examiner’s reflection.
“We shouldn’t have taken the stupid subject in the first place,” said
Harry.
“Still, at least we can give it up now.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “No more pretending we care what happens
when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly . . .”
“And from now on, I don’t care if my tea leaves spell die, Ron, die —
I’m just chucking them in the bin where they belong.”
Harry laughed just as Hermione came running up behind them.
He stopped laughing at once, in case it annoyed her.
“Well, I think I’ve done all right in Arithmancy,” she said, and
Harry and Ron both sighed with relief. “Just time for a quick look
over our star charts before dinner, then . . .”
When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven
o’clock they found a perfect night for stargazing, cloudless and still.
The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight, and there was a slight
chill in the air. Each of them set up his or her telescope and, when
Professor Marchbanks gave the word, proceeded to fill in the blank
star chart he or she had been given.
Professors Marchbanks and Tofty strolled among them, watching
as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets they were
observing. All was quiet except for the rustle of parchment, the occa-
sional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand, and the scrib-
bling of many quills. Half an hour passed, then an hour; the little
squares of reflected gold light flickering on the ground below started
to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished.
As Harry completed the constellation Orion on his chart, however,
the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where
he was standing, so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way
across the lawn. Harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment

718
O.W.L.S
to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows
moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the
lawn became a sea of darkness once more.
Harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it, now ex-
amining Venus. He looked down at his chart to enter the planet there,
but something distracted him. Pausing with his quill suspended over
the parchment, he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw
half a dozen figures walking over the lawn. If they had not been mov-
ing, and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads,
they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on
which they stood. Even at this distance, Harry had a funny feeling
that he recognized the walk of the squattest among them, who seemed
to be leading the group.
He could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll outside
past midnight, much less accompanied by five others. Then some-
body coughed behind him, and he remembered that he was halfway
through an exam. He had quite forgotten Venus’s position — jam-
ming his eye to his telescope, he found it again and was again on the
point of entering it on his chart when, alert for any odd sound, he
heard a distant knock that echoed through the deserted grounds, fol-
lowed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog.
He looked up, his heart hammering. There were lights on in Ha-
grid’s windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were
now silhouetted against them. The door opened and he distinctly saw
six tiny but sharply defined figures walk over the threshold. The door
closed again and there was silence.
Harry felt very uneasy. He glanced around to see whether Ron or
Hermione had noticed what he had, but Professor Marchbanks came
walking behind him at that moment, and not wanting to appear as
though he was sneaking looks at anyone else’s work, he hastily bent
over his star chart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really


CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
peering over the top of the parapet toward Hagrid’s cabin. Figures were
now moving across the cabin windows, temporarily blocking the light.
He could feel Professor Marchbanks’s eyes on the back of his neck
and pressed his eye again to his telescope, staring up at the moon
though he had marked its position an hour ago, but as Professor
Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that
echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower.
Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their
telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid’s cabin.
Professor Tofty gave another dry little cough.
“Try and concentrate, now, boys and girls,” he said softly.
Most people returned to their telescopes. Harry looked to his left.
Hermione was gazing transfixed at Hagrid’s.
“Ahem — twenty minutes to go,” said Professor Tofty.
Hermione jumped and returned at once to her star chart; Harry
looked down at his own and noticed that he had mislabelled Venus as
Mars. He bent to correct it.
There was a loud BANG from the grounds. Several people said
“Ouch!” as they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their
telescopes, hastening to see what was going on below.
Hagrid’s door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the
cabin they saw him quite clearly, a massive figure roaring and bran-
dishing his fists, surrounded by six people, all of whom, judging by
the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction, seemed
to be attempting to Stun him.
“No!” cried Hermione.
“My dear!” said Professor Tofty in a scandalized voice. “This is an
examination!”
But nobody was paying the slightest attention to their star charts
anymore: Jets of red light were still flying beside Hagrid’s cabin, yet
somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him. He was still upright

720
O.W.L.S
and still, as far as Harry could see, fighting. Cries and yells echoed
across the grounds; a man yelled, “Be reasonable, Hagrid!” and Hagrid
roared, “Reasonable be damned, yeh won’ take me like this, Dawlish!”
Harry could see the tiny outline of Fang, attempting to defend Ha-
grid, leaping at the wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell
caught him and he fell to the ground. Hagrid gave a howl of fury,
lifted the culprit bodily from the ground, and threw him: The man
flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again. Hermione
gasped, both hands over her mouth; Harry looked around at Ron and
saw that he too was looking scared. None of them had ever seen Ha-
grid in a real temper before. . . .
“Look!” squealed Parvati, who was leaning over the parapet and
pointing to the foot of the castle where the front doors seemed to have
opened again; more light had spilled out onto the dark lawn and a sin-
gle long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn.
“Now, really!” said Professor Tofty anxiously. “Only sixteen min-
utes left, you know!”
But nobody paid him the slightest attention: They were watching
the person now sprinting toward the battle beside Hagrid’s cabin.
“How dare you!” the figure shouted as she ran. “How dare you!”
“It’s McGonagall!” whispered Hermione.
“Leave him alone! Alone, I say!” said Professor McGonagall’s voice
through the darkness. “On what grounds are you attacking him? He
has done nothing, nothing to warrant such —”
Hermione, Parvati, and Lavender all screamed. No fewer than four
Stunners had shot from the figures around the cabin toward Professor
McGonagall. Halfway between cabin and castle the red beams col-
lided with her. For a moment she looked luminous, illuminated by an
eerie red glow, then was lifted right off her feet, landed hard on her
back, and moved no more.
“Galloping gargoyles!” shouted Professor Tofty, who seemed to

721
CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
have forgotten the exam completely. “Not so much as a warning! Out-
rageous behavior!”
“COWARDS!” bellowed Hagrid, his voice carrying clearly to the
top of the tower, and several lights flickered back on inside the castle.
“RUDDY COWARDS! HAVE SOME O’ THAT — AN’ THAT —”
“Oh my —” gasped Hermione.
Hagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers; judging by
their immediate collapse, they had been knocked cold. Harry saw him
double over and thought for a moment that he had finally been over-
come by a spell, but on the contrary, next moment Hagrid was stand-
ing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back — then Harry
realized that Fang’s limp body was draped around his shoulders.
“Get him, get him!” screamed Umbridge, but her remaining helper
seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of Hagrid’s fists. Indeed,
he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious
colleagues and fell over. Hagrid had turned and begun to run with
Fang still hung around his neck; Umbridge sent one last Stunning
Spell after him but it missed, and Hagrid, running full-pelt toward the
distant gates, disappeared into the darkness.
There was a long minute’s quivering silence, everybody gazing
openmouthed into the grounds. Then Professor Tofty’s voice said fee-
bly, “Um . . . five minutes to go, everybody . . .”
Though he had only filled in two-thirds of his chart, Harry was
desperate for the end of the exam. When it came at last he, Ron, and
Hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders
and dashed back down the spiral staircase. None of the students were
going to bed — they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot
of the stairs about what they had witnessed.
“That evil woman!” gasped Hermione, who seemed to be having
difficulty talking due to rage. “Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the
dead of night!”

722
O.W.L.S
“She clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawney’s,” said
Ernie Macmillan sagely, squeezing over to join them.
“Hagrid did well, didn’t he?” said Ron, who looked more alarmed
than impressed. “How come all the spells bounced off him?”
“It’ll be his giant blood,” said Hermione shakily. “It’s very hard to
Stun a giant, they’re like trolls, really tough. . . . But poor Professor
McGonagall. . . . Four Stunners straight in the chest, and she’s not ex-
actly young, is she?”
“Dreadful, dreadful,” said Ernie, shaking his head pompously.
“Well, I’m off to bed. . . . ’Night, all . . .”
People around them were drifting away, still talking excitedly about
what they had just seen.
“At least they didn’t get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,” said Ron.
“I ’spect he’s gone to join Dumbledore, hasn’t he?”
“I suppose so,” said Hermione, who looked tearful. “Oh, this is aw-
ful, I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now
we’ve lost Hagrid too. . . .”
They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full.
The commotion out in the grounds had woken several people, who
had hastened to rouse their friends. Seamus and Dean, who had ar-
rived ahead of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, were now telling everyone
what they had heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower.
“But why sack Hagrid now?” asked Angelina Johnson, shaking her
head. “It’s not like Trelawney, he’s been teaching much better than
usual this year!”
“Umbridge hates part-humans,” said Hermione bitterly, flopping
down into an armchair. “She was always going to try and get Hagrid
out.”
“And she thought Hagrid was putting nifflers in her office,” piped
up Katie Bell.
“Oh blimey,” said Lee Jordan, covering his mouth. “It’s me’s been

723
CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
putting the nifflers in her office, Fred and George left me a couple,
I’ve been levitating them in through her window. . . .”
“She’d have sacked him anyway,” said Dean. “He was too close to
Dumbledore.”
“That’s true,” said Harry, sinking into an armchair beside Her-
mione’s.
“I just hope Professor McGonagall’s all right,” said Lavender tearfully.
“They carried her back up to the castle, we watched through the dor-
mitory window,” said Colin Creevey “She didn’t look very well. . . .”
“Madam Pomfrey will sort her out,” said Alicia Spinnet firmly.
“She’s never failed yet.”
It was nearly four in the morning before the common room
cleared. Harry felt wide awake — the image of Hagrid sprinting away
into the dark was haunting him. He was so angry with Umbridge he
could not think of a punishment bad enough for her, though Ron’s
suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts
had its merits. He fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and
arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested.
Their final exam, History of Magic, was not to take place until that
afternoon. Harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after
breakfast, but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of last-
minute studying, so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the
common room window, trying hard not to doze off as he read through
some of the notes stacked three-and-a-half feet high that Hermione
had lent him.
The fifth years entered the Great Hall at two o’clock and took their
places in front of their overturned examination papers. Harry felt ex-
hausted. He just wanted this to be over so that he could go and sleep.
Then tomorrow, he and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch
pitch — he was going to have a fly on Ron’s broom and savor their
freedom from studying. . . .

724
O.W.L.S
“Turn over your papers,” said Professor Marchbanks from the front
of the Hall, flicking over the giant hourglass. “You may begin. . . .”
Harry stared fixedly at the first question. It was several seconds be-
fore it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it; there was
a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows. Slowly,
tortuously, he began to write an answer.
He was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept con-
fusing dates. He simply skipped question four: In your opinion, did
wand legislation contribute to, or lead to better control of, goblin riots of
the eighteenth century? thinking that he would go back to it if he had
time at the end. He had a stab at question five: How was the Statute of
Secrecy breached in 1749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a
recurrence? but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several im-
portant points. He had a feeling vampires had come into the story
somewhere. . . .
He looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his
eyes alighted upon number ten.
Describe the circumstances that led to the Formation of the Interna-
tional Confederation of Wizards and explain why the warlocks of Liecht-
enstein refused to join.
I know this, Harry thought, though his brain felt torpid and slack.
He could visualize a heading, in Hermione’s handwriting: The Forma-
tion of the International Confederation of Wizards. . . He had read these
notes only this morning. . . .
He began to write, looking up now and again to check the large
hourglass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks. He was sitting
right behind Parvati Patil, whose long dark hair fell below the back of
her chair. Once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden
lights that glistened in it when she moved her head very slightly and
had to give his own head a little shake to clear it.
. . . the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation


CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
of Wizards was Pierre Bonaccord, but his appointment was contested by
the Wizarding community of Liechtenstein, because —
All around Harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurry-
ing, burrowing rats. The sun was very hot on the back of his head.
What was it that Bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of Liecht-
enstein? Harry had a feeling it had something to do with trolls. . . .
He gazed blankly at the back of Parvati’s head again. If he could only
perform Legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and
see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between Pierre
Bonaccord and Liechtenstein. . . .
Harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands, so that the
glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool. Bonaccord had wanted
to stop troll-hunting and give the trolls rights . . . but Liechtenstein
was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain
trolls. . . . That was it. . . .
He opened his eyes; they stung and watered at the sight of the blaz-
ing-white parchment. Slowly he wrote two lines about the trolls then
read through what he had done so far. It did not seem very informa-
tive or detailed, yet he was sure Hermione’s notes on the confedera-
tion had gone on for pages and pages. . . .
He closed his eyes again, trying to see them, trying to remember.
. . . The confederation had met for the first time in France, yes, he had
written that already. . . .
Goblins had tried to attend and been ousted. . . . He had written
that too. . . .
And nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come . . .
Think, he told himself, his face in his hands, while all around him
quills scratched out never-ending answers and the sand trickled
through the hourglass at the front. . . .
He was walking along the cool, dark corridor to the Department of
Mysteries again, walking with a firm and purposeful tread, breaking

726
O.W.L.S
occasionally into a run, determined to reach his destination at last. . . .
The black door swung open for him as usual, and here he was in the
circular room with its many doors. . . .
Straight across the stone floor and through the second door . . .
patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechan-
ical clicking, but no time to explore, he must hurry. . . .
He jogged the last few feet to the third door, which swung open
just like the others. . . .
Once again he was in the cathedral-sized room full of shelves and
glass spheres. . . . His heart was beating very fast now. . . . He was go-
ing to get there this time. . . . When he reached number ninety-seven
he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows. . . .
But there was a shape on the floor at the very end, a black shape
moving upon the floor like a wounded animal. . . . Harry’s stomach
contracted with fear . . . with excitement. . . .
A voice issued from his own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of
any human kindness, “Take it for me. . . . Lift it down, now. . . . I
cannot touch it . . . but you can. . . .”
The black shape upon the floor shifted a little. Harry saw a long-
fingered white hand clutching a wand rise on the end of his own arm
. . . heard the high, cold voice say, “Crucio!”
The man on the floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand
but fell back, writhing. Harry was laughing. He raised his wand, the
curse lifted, and the figure groaned and became motionless.
“Lord Voldemort is waiting. . . .”
Very slowly, his arms trembling, the man on the ground raised his
shoulders a few inches and lifted his head. His face was bloodstained
and gaunt, twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance. . . .
“You’ll have to kill me,” whispered Sirius.
“Undoubtedly I shall in the end,” said the cold voice. “But you will
fetch it for me first, Black. . . . You think you have felt pain thus far?

727
CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
Think again. . . . We have hours ahead of us and nobody to hear you
scream. . . .”
But somebody screamed as Voldemort lowered his wand again;
somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk onto the cold stone
floor. Harry hit the ground and awoke, still yelling, his scar on fire, as
the Great Hall erupted all around him.


OUT OF THE FIRE
I
’m not going. . . . I don’t need the hospital wing. . . . I don’t
want . . .”
He was gibbering, trying to pull away from Professor Tofty, who
was looking at him with much concern, and who had just helped
Harry out into the entrance hall while the students all around them
stared.
“I’m — I’m fine, sir,” Harry stammered, wiping the sweat from his
face. “Really . . . I just fell asleep. . . . Had a nightmare . . .”
“Pressure of examinations!” said the old wizard sympathetically,
patting Harry shakily on the shoulder. “It happens, young man, it
happens! Now, a cooling drink of water, and perhaps you will be ready
to return to the Great Hall? The examination is nearly over, but you
may be able to round off your last answer nicely?”
“Yes,” said Harry wildly. “I mean . . . no . . . I’ve done — done as
much as I can, I think. . . .”
“Very well, very well,” said the old wizard gently. “I shall go and
collect your examination paper, and I suggest that you go and have a
nice lie down. . . .”

729
CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
“I’ll do that,” said Harry, nodding vigorously. “Thanks very
much.”
He waited for the second when the old man’s heels disappeared
over the threshold into the Great Hall, then ran up the marble stair-
case and then more staircases toward the hospital wing, hurtling along
the corridors so fast that the portraits he passed muttered reproaches,
and burst through the double doors like a hurricane, causing Madam
Pomfrey, who had been spooning some bright blue liquid into Mon-
tague’s open mouth, to shriek in alarm.
“Potter, what do you think you’re doing?”
“I need to see Professor McGonagall,” gasped Harry, the breath
tearing his lungs. “Now . . . It’s urgent. . . .”
“She’s not here, Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey sadly. “She was trans-
ferred to St. Mungo’s this morning. Four Stunning Spells straight to
the chest at her age? It’s a wonder they didn’t kill her.”
“She’s . . . gone?” said Harry, stunned.
The bell rang just outside the dormitory, and he heard the usual
distant rumbling of students starting to flood out into the corridors
above and below him. He remained quite still, looking at Madam
Pomfrey. Terror was rising inside him.
There was nobody left to tell. Dumbledore had gone, Hagrid had
gone, but he had always expected Professor McGonagall to be there,
irascible and inflexible, perhaps, but always dependably, solidly
present. . . .
“I don’t wonder you’re shocked, Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey with
a kind of fierce approval in her face. “As if one of them could have
Stunned Minerva McGonagall face on by daylight! Cowardice, that’s
what it was. . . . Despicable cowardice . . . If I wasn’t worried what
would happen to you students without me, I’d resign in protest. . . .”
“Yes,” said Harry blankly.
He strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor
where he stood, buffeted by the crowd, the panic expanding inside

730
OUT OF THE FIRE
him like poison gas so that his head swam and he could not think
what to do. . . .
Ron and Hermione, said a voice in his head.
He was running again, pushing students out of the way, oblivious
to their angry protests and shouts. He sprinted back down two floors
and was at the top of the marble staircase when he saw them hurrying
toward him.
“Harry!” said Hermione at once, looking very frightened. “What
happened? Are you all right? Are you ill?”
“Where have you been?” demanded Ron.
“Come with me,” Harry said quickly. “Come on, I’ve got to tell
you something. . . .”
He led them along the first-floor corridor, peering through door-
ways, and at last found an empty classroom into which he dived, clos-
ing the door behind Ron and Hermione the moment they were inside
and leaning against it, facing them.
“Voldemort’s got Sirius.”
“What?”
“How d’you — ?”
“Saw it. Just now. When I fell asleep in the exam.”
“But — but where? How?” said Hermione, whose face was white.
“I dunno how,” said Harry. “But I know exactly where. There’s a
room in the Department of Mysteries full of shelves covered in these
little glass balls, and they’re at the end of row ninety-seven . . . He’s
trying to use Sirius to get whatever it is he wants from in there. . . .
He’s torturing him. . . . Says he’ll end by killing him . . .”
Harry found his voice was shaking, as were his knees. He moved
over to a desk and sat down on it, trying to master himself.
“How’re we going to get there?” he asked them.
There was a moment’s silence. Then Ron said, “G-get there?”
“Get to the Department of Mysteries, so we can rescue Sirius!”
Harry said loudly.

731
CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
“But — Harry . . .” said Ron weakly.
“What? What?” said Harry.
He could not understand why they were both gaping at him as
though he was asking them something unreasonable.
“Harry,” said Hermione in a rather frightened voice, “er . . . how
. . . how did Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without any-
body realizing he was there?”
“How do I know?” bellowed Harry. “The question is how we’re
going to get in there!”
“But . . . Harry, think about this,” said Hermione, taking a step
toward him, “it’s five o’clock in the afternoon. . . . The Ministry of
Magic must be full of workers. . . . How would Voldemort and Sirius
have got in without being seen? Harry . . . they’re probably the two
most wanted wizards in the world. . . . You think they could get into
a building full of Aurors undetected?”
“I dunno, Voldemort used an Invisibility Cloak or something!”
Harry shouted. “Anyway, the Department of Mysteries has always
been completely empty whenever I’ve been —”
“You’ve never been there, Harry,” said Hermione quietly. “You’ve
dreamed about the place, that’s all.”
“They’re not normal dreams!” Harry shouted in her face, standing
up and taking a step closer to her in turn. He wanted to shake her.
“How d’you explain Ron’s dad then, what was all that about, how
come I knew what had happened to him?”
“He’s got a point,” said Ron quietly, looking at Hermione.
“But this is just — just so unlikely!” said Hermione desperately.
“Harry, how on earth could Voldemort have got hold of Sirius when
he’s been in Grimmauld Place all the time?”
“Sirius might’ve cracked and just wanted some fresh air,” said Ron,
sounding worried. “He’s been desperate to get out of that house for
ages —”

732
OUT OF THE FIRE
“But why,” Hermione persisted, “why on earth would Voldemort
want to use Sirius to get the weapon, or whatever the thing is?”
“I dunno, there could be loads of reasons!” Harry yelled at her.
“Maybe Sirius is just someone Voldemort doesn’t care about seeing
hurt —”
“You know what, I’ve just thought of something,” said Ron in a
hushed voice. “Sirius’s brother was a Death Eater, wasn’t he? Maybe he
told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon!”
“Yeah — and that’s why Dumbledore’s been so keen to keep Sirius
locked up all the time!” said Harry.
“Look, I’m sorry,” cried Hermione, “but neither of you are making
sense, and we’ve got no proof for any of this, no proof Voldemort and
Sirius are even there —”
“Hermione, Harry’s seen them!” said Ron, rounding on her.
“Okay,” she said, looking frightened yet determined, “I’ve just got
to say this. . . .”
“What?”
“You . . . This isn’t a criticism, Harry! But you do . . . sort of . . . I
mean — don’t you think you’ve got a bit of a — a — saving-people-
thing?” she said.
He glared at her. “And what’s that supposed to mean, a ‘saving-
people-thing’?”
“Well . . . you . . .” She looked more apprehensive than ever. “I
mean . . . last year, for instance . . . in the lake . . . during the Tourna-
ment . . . you shouldn’t have . . . I mean, you didn’t need to save that
little Delacour girl. . . . You got a bit . . . carried away . . .”
A wave of hot, prickly anger swept Harry’s body — how could she
remind him of that blunder now?
“. . . I mean, it was really great of you and everything,” said
Hermione quickly, looking positively petrified at the look on Harry’s
face. “Everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do —”

733
CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
“That’s funny,” said Harry in a trembling voice, “because I definitely
remember Ron saying I’d wasted time acting the hero. . . . Is that what
you think this is? You reckon I want to act the hero again?”
“No, no, no!” said Hermione, looking aghast. “That’s not what I
mean at all!”
“Well, spit out what you’ve got to say, because we’re wasting time
here!” Harry shouted.
“I’m trying to say — Voldemort knows you, Harry! He took Ginny
down into the Chamber of Secrets to lure you there, it’s the kind of
thing he does, he knows you’re the — the sort of person who’d go to
Sirius’s aid! What if he’s just trying to get you into the Department of
Myst — ?”
“Hermione, it doesn’t matter if he’s done it to get me there or
not — they’ve taken McGonagall to St. Mungo’s, there isn’t anyone
left from the Order at Hogwarts who we can tell, and if we don’t go,
Sirius is dead!”
“But Harry — what if your dream was — was just that, a dream?”
Harry let out a roar of frustration. Hermione actually stepped back
from him, looking alarmed.
“You don’t get it!” Harry shouted at her. “I’m not having night-
mares, I’m not just dreaming! What d’you think all the Occlumency
was for, why d’you think Dumbledore wanted me prevented from
seeing these things? Because they’re REAL, Hermione — Sirius is
trapped — I’ve seen him — Voldemort’s got him, and no one else
knows, and that means we’re the only ones who can save him, and if
you don’t want to do it, fine, but I’m going, understand? And if I re-
member rightly, you didn’t have a problem with my saving-people-thing
when it was you I was saving from the dementors, or” — he rounded
on Ron — “when it was your sister I was saving from the basilisk —”
“I never said I had a problem!” said Ron heatedly.
“But Harry, you’ve just said it,” said Hermione fiercely. “Dumble-

dore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind, if
you’d done Occlumency properly you’d never have seen this —”
“IF YOU THINK I’M JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE I
HAVEN’T SEEN —”
“Sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learn-
ing to close your mind!”
“WELL, I EXPECT HE’D SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF
HE KNEW WHAT I’D JUST —”
The classroom door opened. Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped
around. Ginny walked in, looking curious, followed by Luna, who as
usual looked as though she had drifted in accidentally.
“Hi,” said Ginny uncertainly. “We recognized Harry’s voice —
what are you yelling about?”
“Never you mind,” said Harry roughly.
Ginny raised her eyebrows.
“There’s no need to take that tone with me,” she said coolly. “I was
only wondering whether I could help.”
“Well, you can’t,” said Harry shortly.
“You’re being rather rude, you know,” said Luna serenely.
Harry swore and turned away. The very last thing he wanted now
was a conversation with Luna Lovegood.
“Wait,” said Hermione suddenly. “Wait . . . Harry, they can help.”
Harry and Ron looked at her.
“Listen,” she said urgently, “Harry, we need to establish whether
Sirius really has left headquarters —”
“I’ve told you, I saw —”
“Harry, I’m begging you, please!” said Hermione desperately.
“Please let’s just check that Sirius isn’t at home before we go charging
off to London — if we find out he’s not there then I swear I won’t try
and stop you, I’ll come, I’ll d-do whatever it takes to try and save
him —”

“Sirius is being tortured NOW!” shouted Harry. “We haven’t got
time to waste —”
“But if this is a trick of V-Voldemort’s — Harry, we’ve got to check,
we’ve got to —”
“How?” Harry demanded. “How’re we going to check?”
“We’ll have to use Umbridge’s fire and see if we can contact him,”
said Hermione, who looked positively terrified at the thought. “We’ll
draw Umbridge away again, but we’ll need lookouts, and that’s where
we can use Ginny and Luna.”
Though clearly struggling to understand what was going on, Ginny
said immediately, “Yeah, we’ll do it,” and Luna said, “When you say
‘Sirius,’ are you talking about Stubby Boardman?”
Nobody answered her.
“Okay,” Harry said aggressively to Hermione, “Okay, if you can
think of a way of doing this quickly, I’m with you, otherwise I’m go-
ing to the Department of Mysteries right now —”
“The Department of Mysteries?” said Luna, looking mildly sur-
prised. “But how are you going to get there?”
Again, Harry ignored her.
“Right,” said Hermione, twisting her hands together and pacing up
and down between the desks. “Right . . . well . . . One of us has to go
and find Umbridge and — and send her off in the wrong direction,
keep her away from her office. They could tell her — I don’t know —
that Peeves is up to something awful as usual. . . .”
“I’ll do it,” said Ron at once. “I’ll tell her Peeves is smashing up the
Transfiguration department or something, it’s miles away from her of-
fice. Come to think of it, I could probably persuade Peeves to do it if
I met him on the way. . . .”
It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made
no objection to the smashing up of the Transfiguration department.
“Okay,” she said, her brow furrowed as she continued to pace.

“Now, we need to keep students away from her office while we force
entry, or some Slytherin’s bound to go and tip her off. . . .”
“Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,” said Ginny
promptly, “and warn people not to go down there because someone’s
let off a load of Garroting Gas.” Hermione looked surprised at the
readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie. Ginny shrugged
and said, “Fred and George were planning to do it before they left.”
“Okay,” said Hermione, “well then, Harry, you and I will be under
the Invisibility Cloak, and we’ll sneak into the office and you can talk
to Sirius —”
“He’s not there, Hermione!”
“I mean, you can — can check whether Sirius is at home or not
while I keep watch, I don’t think you should be in there alone, Lee’s
already proved the window’s a weak spot, sending those nifflers
through it.”
Even through his anger and impatience Harry recognized Her-
mione’s offer to accompany him into Umbridge’s office as a sign of
solidarity and loyalty.
“I . . . okay, thanks,” he muttered.
“Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don’t think we’re going to
be able to bank on more than five minutes,” said Hermione, looking
relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan, “not with Filch
and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.”
“Five minutes’ll be enough,” said Harry. “C’mon, let’s go —”
“Now?” said Hermione, looking shocked.
“Of course now!” said Harry angrily. “What did you think, we’re
going to wait until after dinner or something? Hermione, Sirius is be-
ing tortured right now!”
“I — oh all right,” she said desperately. “You go and get the Invisi-
bility Cloak and we’ll meet you at the end of Umbridge’s corridor,
okay?”


CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
Harry did not answer, but flung himself out of the room and began
to fight his way through the milling crowds outside. Two floors up he
met Seamus and Dean, who hailed him jovially and told him they
were planning a dusk-till-dawn end-of-exams celebration in the com-
mon room. Harry barely heard them. He scrambled through the por-
trait hole while they were still arguing about how many black-market
butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it, the In-
visibility Cloak and Sirius’s knife secure in his bag, before they noticed
he had left them.
“Harry, d’you want to chip in a couple of Galleons? Harold Dingle
reckons he could sell us some firewhisky. . . .”
But Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor, and a
couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron,
Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, who were huddled together at the end
of Umbridge’s corridor.
“Got it,” he panted. “Ready to go, then?”
“All right,” whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth years
passed them. “So Ron — you go and head Umbridge off. . . . Ginny,
Luna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor. . . . Harry
and I will get the cloak on and wait until the coast is clear. . . .”
Ron strode away, his bright red hair visible right to the end of the
passage. Meanwhile, Ginny’s equally vivid head bobbed between the
jostling students surrounding them in the other direction, trailed by
Luna’s blonde one.
“Get over here,” muttered Hermione, tugging at Harry’s wrist and
pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval
wizard stood muttering to itself on a column. “Are — are you sure
you’re okay, Harry? You’re still very pale. . . .”
“I’m fine,” he said shortly, tugging the Invisibility Cloak from out
of his bag. In truth, his scar was aching, but not so badly that he
thought Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius a fatal blow. It had hurt much
worse than this when Voldemort had been punishing Avery. . . .


OUT OF THE FIRE
“Here,” he said. He threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them
and they stood listening carefully over the Latin mumblings of the
bust in front of them.
“You can’t come down here!” Ginny was calling to the crowd. “No,
sorry, you’re going to have to go round by the swiveling staircase,
someone’s let off Garroting Gas just along here —”
They could hear people complaining; one surly voice said, “I can’t
see no gas . . .”
“That’s because it’s colorless,” said Ginny in a convincingly exas-
perated voice, “but if you want to walk through it, carry on, then we’ll
have your body as proof for the next idiot who didn’t believe us. . . .”
Slowly the crowd thinned. The news about the Garroting Gas
seemed to have spread — people were not coming this way anymore.
When at last the surrounding area was quite clear, Hermione said qui-
etly, “I think that’s as good as we’re going to get, Harry — come on,
let’s do it.”
Together they moved forward, covered by the cloak. Luna was
standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor. As they
passed Ginny, Hermione whispered, “Good one . . . don’t forget the
signal . . .”
“What’s the signal?” muttered Harry, as they approached Urn-
bridge’s door.
“A loud chorus of ‘Weasley Is Our King’ if they see Umbridge com-
ing,” replied Hermione, as Harry inserted the blade of Sirius’s knife in
the crack between door and wall. The lock clicked open, and they en-
tered the office.
The garish kittens were basking in the late afternoon sunshine
warming their plates, but otherwise the office was as still and empty as
last time. Hermione breathed a sigh of relief.
“I thought she might have added extra security after the second
niffler. . . .”
They pulled off the cloak. Hermione hurried over to the window


CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
and stood out of sight, peering down into the grounds with her wand
out. Harry dashed over to the fireplace, seized the pot of Floo powder,
and threw a pinch into the grate, causing emerald flames to burst into
life there. He knelt down quickly, thrust his head into the dancing
fire, and cried, “Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!”
His head began to spin as though he had just got off a fairground
ride though his knees remained firmly planted upon the cold office
floor. He kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash, and when
the spinning stopped, he opened them to find himself looking out
upon the long, cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place.
There was nobody there. He had expected this, yet was not pre-
pared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst
through his stomach floor at the sight of the deserted room.
“Sirius?” he shouted. “Sirius, are you there?”
His voice echoed around the room, but there was no answer except
a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire.
“Who’s there?” he called, wondering whether it was just a mouse.
Kreacher the house-elf came creeping into view. He looked highly
delighted about something, though he seemed to have recently sus-
tained a nasty injury to both hands, which were heavily bandaged.
“It’s the Potter boy’s head in the fire,” Kreacher informed the empty
kitchen, stealing furtive, oddly triumphant glances at Harry. “What
has he come for, Kreacher wonders?”
“Where’s Sirius, Kreacher?” Harry demanded.
The house-elf gave a wheezy chuckle. “Master has gone out, Harry
Potter.”
“Where’s he gone? Where’s he gone, Kreacher?”
Kreacher merely cackled.
“I’m warning you!” said Harry, fully aware that his scope for inflict-
ing punishment upon Kreacher was almost nonexistent in this position.
“What about Lupin? Mad-Eye? Any of them, are any of them here?”

740
OUT OF THE FIRE
“Nobody here but Kreacher!” said the elf gleefully, and turning
away from Harry he began to walk slowly toward the door at the end
of the kitchen. “Kreacher thinks he will have a little chat with his
Mistress now, yes, he hasn’t had a chance in a long time, Kreacher’s
Master has been keeping him away from her —”
“Where has Sirius gone?” Harry yelled after the elf. “Kreacher, has
he gone to the Department of Mysteries?”
Kreacher stopped in his tracks. Harry could just make out the back
of his bald head through the forest of chair legs before him.
“Master does not tell poor Kreacher where he is going,” said the elf
quietly.
“But you know!” shouted Harry. “Don’t you? You know where
he is!”
There was a moment’s silence, then the elf let out his loudest cackle
yet. “Master will not come back from the Department of Mysteries!”
he said gleefully. “Kreacher and his Mistress are alone again!”
And he scurried forward and disappeared through the door to the
hall.
“You — !”
But before he could utter a single curse or insult, Harry felt a great
pain at the top of his head. He inhaled a lot of ash and, choking,
found himself being dragged backward through the flames until, with
a horrible abruptness, he was staring up into the wide, pallid face of
Professor Umbridge, who had dragged him backward out of the fire
by the hair and was now bending his neck back as far as it would go as
though she was going to slit his throat.
“You think,” she whispered, bending Harry’s neck back even far-
ther, so that he was looking up at the ceiling above him, “that after
two nifflers I was going to let one more foul, scavenging little creature
enter my office without my knowledge? I had Stealth Sensoring Spells
placed all around my doorway after the last one got in, you foolish

boy. Take his wand,” she barked at someone he could not see, and he
felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the
wand. “Hers too . . .”
Harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that Hermione
had just had her wand wrested from her as well.
“I want to know why you are in my office,” said Umbridge, shak-
ing the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered.
“I was — trying to get my Firebolt!” Harry croaked.
“Liar.” She shook his head again. “Your Firebolt is under strict
guard in the dungeons, as you very well know, Potter. You had your
head in my fire. With whom have you been communicating?”
“No one —” said Harry, trying to pull away from her. He felt sev-
eral hairs part company with his scalp.
“Liar!” shouted Umbridge. She threw him from her, and he
slammed into the desk. Now he could see Hermione pinioned against
the wall by Millicent Bulstrode. Malfoy was leaning on the win-
dowsill, smirking as he threw Harry’s wand into the air one-handed
and then caught it again.
There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins
entered, each gripping Ron, Ginny, Luna, and — to Harry’s bewil-
derment — Neville, who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe
and looked in imminent danger of suffocation. All four of them had
been gagged.
“Got ’em all,” said Warrington, shoving Ron roughly forward into
the room. “That one.” he poked a thick finger at Neville, “tried to stop
me taking her,” he pointed at Ginny, who was trying to kick the shins
of the large Slytherin girl holding her, “so I brought him along too.”
“Good, good,” said Umbridge, watching Ginny’s struggles. “Well,
it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley-free zone,
doesn’t it?”
Malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically. Umbridge gave her

742
OUT OF THE FIRE
wide, complacent smile and settled herself into a chintz-covered arm-
chair, blinking up at her captives like a toad in a flowerbed.
“So, Potter,” she said. “You stationed lookouts around my office
and you sent this buffoon,” she nodded at Ron, and Malfoy laughed
even louder, “to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the
Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was
busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes, Mr.
Filch having just informed me so.
“Clearly, it was very important for you to talk to somebody. Was it
Albus Dumbledore? Or the half-breed, Hagrid? I doubt it was Min-
erva McGonagall, I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone. . . .”
Malfoy and a few of the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad
laughed some more at that. Harry found he was so full of rage and ha-
tred he was shaking.
“It’s none of your business who I talk to,” he snarled.
Umbridge’s slack face seemed to tighten.
“Very well,” she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice.
“Very well, Mr. Potter . . . I offered you the chance to tell me freely.
You refused. I have no alternative but to force you. Draco — fetch
Professor Snape.”
Malfoy stowed Harry’s wand inside his robes and left the room
smirking, but Harry hardly noticed. He had just realized some-
thing; he could not believe he had been so stupid as to forget it. He
had thought that all the members of the Order, all those who could
help him save Sirius, were gone — but he had been wrong. There
was still a member of the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts —
Snape.
There was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scuf-
flings resultant from the Slytherins’ efforts to keep Ron and the others
under control. Ron’s lip was bleeding onto Umbridge’s carpet as he
struggled against Warrington’s half nelson. Ginny was still trying to

743
CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
stamp on the feet of the sixth-year girl who had both her upper arms
in a tight grip. Neville was turning steadily more purple in the face
while tugging at Crabbe’s arms, and Hermione was attempting vainly
to throw Millicent Bulstrode off her. Luna, however, stood limply by
the side of her captor, gazing vaguely out of the window as though
rather bored by the proceedings.
Harry looked back at Umbridge, who was watching him closely.
He kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were
heard in the corridor outside and Draco Malfoy came back into the
room, holding open the door for Snape.
“You wanted to see me, Headmistress?” said Snape, looking around
at all the pairs of struggling students with an expression of complete
indifference.
“Ah, Professor Snape,” said Umbridge, smiling widely and standing
up again. “Yes, I would like another bottle of Veritaserum, as quick as
you can, please.”
“You took my last bottle to interrogate Potter,” he said, observing
her coolly through his greasy curtains of black hair. “Surely you did
not use it all? I told you that three drops would be sufficient.”
Umbridge flushed.
“You can make some more, can’t you?” she said, her voice becom-
ing more sweetly girlish as it always did when she was furious.
“Certainly,” said Snape, his lip curling. “It takes a full moon cycle
to mature, so I should have it ready for you in around a month.”
“A month?” squawked Umbridge, swelling toadishly. “A month?
But I need it this evening, Snape! I have just found Potter using my
fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown!”
“Really?” said Snape, showing his first, faint sign of interest as he
looked around at Harry. “Well, it doesn’t surprise me. Potter has never
shown much inclination to follow school rules.”
His cold, dark eyes were boring into Harry’s, who met his gaze un-

744
OUT OF THE FIRE
flinchingly, concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream,
willing Snape to read it in his mind, to understand . . .
“I wish to interrogate him!” shouted Umbridge angrily, and Snape
looked away from Harry back into her furiously quivering face. “I
wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me
the truth!”
“I have already told you,” said Snape smoothly, “that I have no fur-
ther stocks of Veritaserum. Unless you wish to poison Potter — and I
assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did —
I cannot help you. The only trouble is that most venoms act too fast
to give the victim much time for truth-telling. . . .”
Snape looked back at Harry, who stared at him, frantic to commu-
nicate without words.
Voldemort’s got Sirius in the Department of Mysteries, he thought des-
perately. Voldemort’s got Sirius —
“You are on probation!” shrieked Professor Umbridge, and Snape
looked back at her, his eyebrows slightly raised. “You are being delib-
erately unhelpful! I expected better, Lucius Malfoy always speaks most
highly of you! Now get out of my office!”
Snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave. Harry knew his
last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking
out of the door.
“He’s got Padfoot!” he shouted. “He’s got Padfoot at the place
where it’s hidden!”
Snape had stopped with his hand on Umbridge’s door handle.
“Padfoot?” cried Professor Umbridge, looking eagerly from Harry
to Snape. “What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What does he
mean, Snape?”
Snape looked around at Harry. His face was inscrutable. Harry
could not tell whether he had understood or not, but he did not dare
speak more plainly in front of Umbridge.

745
CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
“I have no idea,” said Snape coldly. “Potter, when I want nonsense
shouted at me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage. And Crabbe,
loosen your hold a little, if Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of
tedious paperwork, and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your
reference if ever you apply for a job.”
He closed the door behind him with a snap, leaving Harry in a state
of worse turmoil than before: Snape had been his very last hope. He
looked at Umbridge, who seemed to be feeling the same way; her
chest was heaving with rage and frustration.
“Very well,” she said, and she pulled out her wand. “Very well . . .
I am left with no alternative. . . . This is more than a matter of school
discipline. . . . This is an issue of Ministry security. . . . Yes . . .
yes . . .”
She seemed to be talking herself into something. She was shifting
her weight nervously from foot to foot, staring at Harry, beating her
wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily. Harry felt horri-
bly powerless without his own wand as he watched her.
“You are forcing me, Potter. . . . I do not want to,” said Umbridge,
still moving restlessly on the spot, “but sometimes circumstances jus-
tify the use . . . I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no
choice. . . .”
Malfoy was watching her with a hungry expression on his face.
“The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,” said Um-
bridge quietly.
“No!” shrieked Hermione. “Professor Umbridge — it’s illegal” —
but Umbridge took no notice. There was a nasty, eager, excited look
on her face that Harry had never seen before. She raised her wand.
“The Minister wouldn’t want you to break the law, Professor Um-
bridge!” cried Hermione.
“What Cornelius doesn’t know won’t hurt him,” said Umbridge,
who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different

746
OUT OF THE FIRE
parts of Harry’s body in turn, apparently trying to decide what would
hurt the most. “He never knew I ordered dementors after Potter last
summer, but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him, all
the same. . . .”
“It was you?” gasped Harry. “You sent the dementors after me?”
“Somebody had to act,” breathed Umbridge, as her wand came to
rest pointing directly at Harry’s forehead. “They were all bleating
about silencing you somehow — discrediting you — but I was the
one who actually did something about it. . . . Only you wriggled out
of that one, didn’t you, Potter? Not today, though, not now . . .”
And taking a deep breath, she cried, “Cruc —”
“NO!” shouted Hermione in a cracked voice from behind Milli-
cent Bulstrode. “No — Harry — Harry, we’ll have to tell her!”
“No way!” yelled Harry, staring at the little of Hermione he could
see.
“We’ll have to, Harry, she’ll force it out of you anyway, what’s . . .
what’s the point. . . ?”
And Hermione began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bul-
strode’s robes. Millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall
immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted.
“Well, well, well!” said Umbridge, looking triumphant. “Little
Miss Question-All is going to give us some answers! Come on then,
girl, come on!”
“Er — my — nee — no!” shouted Ron through his gag.
Ginny was staring at Hermione as though she had never seen her
before; Neville, still choking for breath, was gazing at her too. But
Harry had just noticed something. Though Hermione was sobbing
desperately into her hands, there was no trace of a tear. . . .
“I’m — I’m sorry everyone,” said Hermione. “But — I can’t stand
it —”
“That’s right, that’s right, girl!” said Umbridge, seizing Hermione

747
CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
by the shoulders, thrusting her into the abandoned chintz chair and
leaning over her. “Now then . . . with whom was Potter communicat-
ing just now?”
“Well,” gulped Hermione into her hands, “well, he was trying to
speak to Professor Dumbledore. . . .”
Ron froze, his eyes wide; Ginny stopped trying to stamp on her
Slytherin captor’s toes; even Luna looked mildly surprised. Fortu-
nately, the attention of Umbridge and her minions was focused too
exclusively upon Hermione to notice these suspicious signs.
“Dumbledore?” said Umbridge eagerly. “You know where Dumb-
ledore is, then?”
“Well . . . no!” sobbed Hermione. “We’ve tried the Leaky Caul-
dron in Diagon Alley and the Three Broomsticks and even the Hog’s
Head —”
“Idiot girl, Dumbledore won’t be sitting in a pub when the whole
Ministry’s looking for him!” shouted Umbridge, disappointment
etched in every sagging line of her face.
“But — but we needed to tell him something important!” wailed
Hermione, holding her hands more tightly over her face, not, Harry
knew, out of anguish, but to disguise the continued absence of tears.
“Yes?” said Umbridge with a sudden resurgence of excitement.
“What was it you wanted to tell him?”
“We . . . we wanted to tell him it’s r-ready!” choked Hermione.
“What’s ready?” demanded Umbridge, and now she grabbed
Hermione’s shoulders again and shook her slightly. “What’s ready,
girl?”
“The . . . the weapon,” said Hermione.
“Weapon? Weapon?” said Umbridge, and her eyes seemed to pop
with excitement. “You have been developing some method of resis-
tance? A weapon you could use against the Ministry? On Professor
Dumbledore’s orders, of course?”

748
OUT OF THE FIRE
“Y-y-yes,” gasped Hermione. “But he had to leave before it was fin-
ished and n-n-now we’ve finished it for him, and we c-c-can’t find him
t-t-to tell him!”
“What kind of weapon is it?” said Umbridge harshly, her stubby
hands still tight on Hermione’s shoulders.
“We don’t r-r-really understand it,” said Hermione, sniffing loudly.
“We j-j-just did what P-P-Professor Dumbledore told us t-t-to
do . . .”
Umbridge straightened up, looking exultant.
“Lead me to the weapon,” she said.
“I’m not showing . . . them,” said Hermione shrilly, looking around
at the Slytherins through her fingers.
“It is not for you to set conditions,” said Professor Umbridge
harshly.
“Fine,” said Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again, “fine
. . . let them see it, I hope they use it on you! In fact, I wish you’d in-
vite loads and loads of people to come and see! Th-that would serve
you right — oh, I’d love it if the wh-whole school knew where it was,
and how to u-use it, and then if you annoy any of them they’ll be able
to s-sort you out!”
These words had a powerful impact on Umbridge. She glanced
swiftly and suspiciously around at her Inquisitorial Squad, her bulging
eyes resting for a moment on Malfoy, who was too slow to disguise the
look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face.
Umbridge contemplated Hermione for another long moment and
then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice. “All
right, dear, let’s make it just you and me . . . and we’ll take Potter too,
shall we? Get up, now —”
“Professor,” said Malfoy eagerly, “Professor Umbridge, I think
some of the squad should come with you to look after —”
“I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think

I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone?” asked Umbridge
sharply. “In any case, it does not sound as though this weapon is
something that schoolchildren should see. You will remain here until
I return and make sure none of these” — she gestured around at Ron,
Ginny, Neville, and Luna — “escape.”
“All right,” said Malfoy, looking sulky and disappointed.
“And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way,” said Um-
bridge, pointing at Harry and Hermione with her wand. “Lead
on. . . .”

H
arry had no idea what Hermione was planning, or even
whether she had a plan. He walked half a pace behind her as
they headed down the corridor outside Umbridge’s office, knowing it
would look very suspicious if he appeared not to know where they
were going. He did not dare attempt to talk to her; Umbridge was
walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged
breathing.
Hermione led the way down the stairs into the entrance hall. The
din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out
of the double doors to the Great Hall. It seemed incredible to Harry
that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, cele-
brating the end of exams, not a care in the world. . . .
Hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the
stone steps into the balmy evening air. The sun was falling toward the
tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now as Hermione marched
purposefully across the grass, Umbridge jogging to keep up. Their
long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks.


CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
“It’s hidden in Hagrid’s hut, is it?” said Umbridge eagerly in Harry’s
ear.
“Of course not,” said Hermione scathingly. “Hagrid might have set
it off accidentally.”
“Yes,” said Umbridge, whose excitement seemed to be mounting.
“Yes, he would have done, of course, the great half-breed oaf. . . .”
She laughed. Harry felt a strong urge to swing around and seize her
by the throat, but resisted. His scar was throbbing in the soft evening
air but it had not yet burned white-hot, as he knew it would if Volde-
mort had moved in for the kill. . . .
“Then . . . where is it?” asked Umbridge, with a hint of uncertainty
in her voice as Hermione continued to stride toward the forest.
“In there, of course,” said Hermione, pointing into the dark trees.
“It had to be somewhere that students weren’t going to find it acci-
dentally, didn’t it?”
“Of course,” said Umbridge, though she sounded a little apprehen-
sive now. “Of course . . . very well, then . . . you two stay ahead of
me.”
“Can we have your wand, then, if we’re going first?” Harry asked
her.
“No, I don’t think so, Mr. Potter,” said Umbridge sweetly, poking
him in the back with it. “The Ministry places a rather higher value on
my life than yours, I’m afraid.”
As they reached the cool shade of the first trees, Harry tried to catch
Hermione’s eye; walking into the forest without wands seemed to him
to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening.
She, however, merely gave Umbridge a contemptuous glance and
plunged straight into the trees, moving at such a pace that Umbridge,
with her shorter legs, had difficulty in keeping up.
“Is it very far in?” Umbridge asked, as her robe ripped on a bramble.
“Oh yes,” said Hermione. “Yes, it’s well hidden.”
Harry’s misgivings increased. Hermione was not taking the path


they had followed to visit Grawp, but the one he had followed three
years ago to the lair of the monster Aragog. Hermione had not been
with him on that occasion; he doubted she had any idea what danger
lay at the end of it.
“Er — are you sure this is the right way?” he asked her pointedly.
“Oh yes,” she said in a steely voice, crashing through the under-
growth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of
noise. Behind them, Umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling. Neither
of them paused to help her up again; Hermione merely strode on,
calling loudly over her shoulder, “It’s a bit further in!”
“Hermione, keep your voice down,” Harry muttered, hurrying to
catch up with her. “Anything could be listening in here —”
“I want us heard,” she answered quietly, as Umbridge jogged nois-
ily after them. “You’ll see. . . .”
They walked on for what seemed a long time, until they were once
again so deep into the forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all
light. Harry had the feeling he had had before in the forest, one of be-
ing watched by unseen eyes. . . .
“How much further?” demanded Umbridge angrily from behind
him.
“Not far now!” shouted Hermione, as they emerged into a dim,
dank clearing. “Just a little bit —”
An arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in
the tree just over her head. The air was suddenly full of the sound of
hooves. Harry could feel the forest floor trembling; Umbridge gave a
little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield —
He wrenched himself free of her and turned. Around fifty centaurs
were emerging on every side, their bows raised and loaded, pointing at
Harry, Hermione, and Umbridge, who backed slowly into the center
of the clearing, Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror.
Harry looked sideways at Hermione. She was wearing a triumphant
smile.

753
CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
“Who are you?” said a voice.
Harry looked left. The chestnut-bodied centaur called Magorian
was walking toward them out of the circle; his bow, like the others’,
was raised. On Harry’s right, Umbridge was still whimpering, her
wand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur.
“I asked you who are you, human,” said Magorian roughly.
“I am Dolores Umbridge!” said Umbridge in a high-pitched, terri-
fied voice. “Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic and Head-
mistress and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts!”
“You are from the Ministry of Magic?” said Magorian, as many of
the centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly.
“That’s right!” said Umbridge in an even higher voice. “So be very
careful! By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation
and Control of Magical Creatures, any attack by half-breeds such as
yourselves on a human —”
“What did you call us?” shouted a wild-looking black centaur,
whom Harry recognized as Bane. There was a great deal of angry mut-
tering and tightening of bowstrings around them.
“Don’t call them that!” Hermione said furiously, but Umbridge did
not appear to have heard her. Still pointing her shaking wand at
Magorian, she continued, “Law Fifteen B states clearly that ‘Any at-
tack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelli-
gence, and therefore considered responsible for its actions —’ ”
“ ‘Near-human intelligence’?” repeated Magorian, as Bane and sev-
eral others roared with rage and pawed the ground. “We consider that
a great insult, human! Our intelligence, thankfully, far outstrips your
own —”
“What are you doing in our forest?” bellowed the hard-faced gray
centaur whom Harry and Hermione had seen on their last trip into
the forest. “Why are you here?”
“Your forest?” said Umbridge, shaking now not only with fright but
also, it seemed, with indignation. “I would remind you that you live

754
FIGHT AND FLIGHT
here only because the Ministry of Magic permits you certain areas of
land —”
An arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair
in passing. She let out an earsplitting scream and threw her hands over
her head while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and oth-
ers laughed raucously. The sound of their wild, neighing laughter
echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing
hooves was extremely unnerving.
“Whose forest is it now, human?” bellowed Bane.
“Filthy half-breeds!” she screamed, her hands still tight over her
head. “Beasts! Uncontrolled animals!”
“Be quiet!” shouted Hermione, but it was too late — Umbridge
pointed her wand at Magorian and screamed, “Incarcerous!”
Ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes, wrapping themselves
tightly around the centaur’s torso and trapping his arms. He gave a cry
of rage and reared onto his hind legs, attempting to free himself, while
the other centaurs charged.
Harry grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the ground. Facedown
on the forest floor he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered
around him, but the centaurs leapt over and around them, bellowing
and screaming with rage.
“Nooooo!” he heard Umbridge shriek. “Noooooo . . . I am Senior
Undersecretary . . . you cannot . . . unhand me, you animals . . .
nooooo!”
He saw a flash of red light and knew that she had attempted to Stun
one of them — then she screamed very loudly. Lifting his head a few
inches, Harry saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by
Bane and lifted high into the air, wriggling and yelling with fright.
Her wand fell from her hand to the ground and Harry’s heart leapt, if
he could just reach it —
But as he stretched out a hand toward it, a centaur’s hoof descended
upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half.

755
CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
“Now!” roared a voice in Harry’s ear and a thick hairy arm de-
scended from thin air and dragged him upright; Hermione too had
been pulled to her feet. Over the plunging, many-colored backs and
heads of the centaurs Harry saw Umbridge being borne away through
the trees by Bane, still screaming nonstop; her voice grew fainter and
fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves
surrounding them.
“And these?” said the hard-faced, gray centaur holding Hermione.
“They are young,” said a slow, doleful voice from behind Harry.
“We do not attack foals.”
“They brought her here, Ronan,” replied the centaur who had such
a firm grip on Harry. “And they are not so young. . . . He is nearing
manhood, this one. . . .”
He shook Harry by the neck of his robes.
“Please,” said Hermione breathlessly, “please, don’t attack us, we
don’t think like her, we aren’t Ministry of Magic employees! We only
came in here because we hoped you’d drive her off for us —”
Harry knew at once from the look on the face of the gray centaur
holding Hermione that she had made a terrible mistake in saying this.
The gray centaur threw back his head, his back legs stamping furi-
ously, and bellowed, “You see, Ronan? They already have the arro-
gance of their kind! So we were to do your dirty work, were we,
human girl? We were to act as your servants, drive away your enemies
like obedient hounds?”
“No!” said Hermione in a horrorstruck squeak. “Please — I didn’t
mean that! I just hoped you’d be able to — to help us —”
But she seemed to be going from bad to worse.
“We do not help humans!” snarled the centaur holding Harry,
tightening his grip and rearing a little at the same time, so that Harry’s
feet left the ground momentarily. “We are a race apart and proud to
be so. . . . We will not permit you to walk from here, boasting that we
did your bidding!”

756
FIGHT AND FLIGHT
“We’re not going to say anything like that!” Harry shouted. “We
know you didn’t do anything because we wanted you to —”
But nobody seemed to be listening to him. A bearded centaur to-
ward the back of the crowd shouted, “They came here unasked, they
must pay the consequences!”
A roar of approval met these words and a dun-colored centaur
shouted, “They can join the woman!”
“You said you didn’t hurt the innocent!” shouted Hermione, real
tears sliding down her face now. “We haven’t done anything to hurt
you, we haven’t used wands or threats, we just want to go back to
school, please let us go back —”
“We are not all like the traitor Firenze, human girl!” shouted the
gray centaur, to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows.
“Perhaps you thought us pretty talking horses? We are an ancient peo-
ple who will not stand wizard invasions and insults! We do not recog-
nize your laws, we do not acknowledge your superiority, we are —”
But they did not hear what else centaurs were, for at that moment
there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all
of them — Harry, Hermione, and the fifty or so centaurs filling the
clearing — looked around. Harry’s centaur let him fall to the ground
again as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows; Hermione
had been dropped too, and Harry hurried toward her as two thick tree
trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant
appeared in the gap.
The centaurs nearest him backed into those behind. The clearing
was now a forest of bows and arrows waiting to be fired, all pointing
upward at the enormous grayish face now looming over them from
just beneath the thick canopy of branches. Grawp’s lopsided mouth
was gaping stupidly. They could see his bricklike yellow teeth glim-
mering in the half-light, his dull sludge-colored eyes narrowed as he
squinted down at the creatures at his feet. Broken ropes trailed from
both ankles.

757
CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
He opened his mouth even wider.
“Hagger.”
Harry did not know what “hagger” meant, or what language it was
from, nor did he much care — he was watching Grawp’s feet, which
were almost as long as Harry’s whole body. Hermione gripped his arm
tightly; the centaurs were quite silent, staring up at the giant, whose
huge, round head moved from side to side as he continued to peer
amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped.
“Hagger!” he said again, more insistently.
“Get away from here, giant!” called Magorian. “You are not wel-
come among us!”
These words seemed to make no impression whatsoever on Grawp.
He stooped a little (the centaurs’ arms tensed on their bows) and then
bellowed, “HAGGER!”
A few of the centaurs looked worried now. Hermione, however,
gave a gasp.
“Harry!” she whispered. “I think he’s trying to say ‘Hagrid’!”
At this precise moment Grawp caught sight of them, the only two
humans in a sea of centaurs. He lowered his head another foot or so,
staring intently at them. Harry could feel Hermione shaking as
Grawp opened his mouth wide again and said, in a deep, rumbling
voice, “Hermy.”
“Goodness,” said Hermione, gripping Harry’s arm so tightly it was
growing numb and looking as though she was about to faint, “he —
he remembered!”
“HERMY!” roared Grawp. “WHERE HAGGER?”
“I don’t know!” squealed Hermione, terrified. “I’m sorry, Grawp, I
don’t know!”
“GRAWP WANT HAGGER!”
One of the giant’s massive hands swooped down upon them —
Hermione let out a real scream, ran a few steps backward and fell over.
Wandless, Harry braced himself to punch, kick, bite, or whatever else

758
FIGHT AND FLIGHT
it took as the hand flew toward him and knocked a snow-white cen-
taur off his legs.
It was what the centaurs had been waiting for — Grawp’s out-
stretched fingers were a foot from Harry when fifty arrows went soar-
ing through the air at the giant, peppering his enormous face, causing
him to howl with pain and rage and straighten up again, rubbing his
face with his enormous hands, breaking off the arrow shafts but forc-
ing the heads in still deeper.
He yelled and stamped his enormous feet and the centaurs scat-
tered out of the way. Pebble-sized droplets of Grawp’s blood showered
Harry as he pulled Hermione to her feet and the pair of them ran as
fast as they could for the shelter of the trees. Once there they looked
back — Grawp was snatching blindly at the centaurs as blood ran all
down his face; they were retreating in disorder, galloping away
through the trees on the other side of the clearing. As Harry and
Hermione watched, Grawp gave another roar of fury and plunged af-
ter them, smashing more trees aside as he went.
“Oh no,” said Hermione, quaking so badly that her knees gave way.
“Oh, that was horrible. And he might kill them all. . . .”
“I’m not that fussed, to be honest,” said Harry bitterly.
The sounds of the galloping centaurs and the blundering giant
were growing fainter and fainter. As Harry listened to them his scar
gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him.
They had wasted so much time — they were even further from res-
cuing Sirius than they had been when he had had the vision. Not only
had Harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the mid-
dle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever.
“Smart plan,” he spat at Hermione, keen to release some of his fury.
“Really smart plan. Where do we go from here?”
“We need to get back up to the castle,” said Hermione faintly.
“By the time we’ve done that, Sirius’ll probably be dead!” said
Harry, kicking a nearby tree in temper; there was a high-pitched

759
CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
chattering overhead and he looked up to see an angry bowtruckle flex-
ing its long twiglike fingers at him.
“Well, we can’t do anything without wands,” said Hermione hope-
lessly, dragging herself up again. “Anyway, Harry, how exactly were
you planning to get all the way to London?”
“Yeah, we were just wondering that,” said a familiar voice from be-
hind her.
Harry and Hermione moved instinctively together, peering through
the trees, as Ron came into sight, with Ginny, Neville, and Luna hur-
rying along behind him. All of them looked a little the worse for
wear — there were several long scratches running the length of
Ginny’s cheek, a large purple lump was swelling above Neville’s right
eye, Ron’s lip was bleeding worse than ever — but all were looking
rather pleased with themselves.
“So,” said Ron, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding
out Harry’s wand, “had any ideas?”
“How did you get away?” asked Harry in amazement, taking his
wand from Ron.
“Couple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, Neville brought off a re-
ally nice little Impediment Jinx,” said Ron airily, now handing back
Hermione’s wand too. “But Ginny was best, she got Malfoy — Bat-
Bogey Hex — it was superb, his whole face was covered in the great
flapping things. Anyway, we saw you heading into the forest out of the
window and followed. What’ve you done with Umbridge?”
“She got carried away,” said Harry. “By a herd of centaurs.”
“And they left you behind?” asked Ginny, looking astonished.
“No, they got chased off by Grawp,” said Harry.
“Who’s Grawp?” Luna asked interestedly.
“Hagrid’s little brother,” said Ron promptly. “Anyway, never mind
that now. Harry, what did you find out in the fire? Has You-Know-
Who got Sirius or — ?”
“Yes,” said Harry, as his scar gave another painful prickle, “and I’m

760
FIGHT AND FLIGHT
sure Sirius is still alive, but I can’t see how we’re going to get there to
help him.”
They all fell silent, looking rather scared. The problem facing them
seemed insurmountable.
“Well, we’ll have to fly, won’t we?” said Luna in the closest thing to
a matter-of-fact voice Harry had ever heard her use.
“Okay,” said Harry irritably, rounding on her, “first of all, ‘we’
aren’t doing anything if you’re including yourself in that, and second
of all, Ron’s the only one with a broomstick that isn’t being guarded by
a security troll, so —”
“I’ve got a broom!” said Ginny.
“Yeah, but you’re not coming,” said Ron angrily.
“Excuse me, but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do!”
said Ginny, her jaw set so that her resemblance to Fred and George
was suddenly striking.
“You’re too —” Harry began.
“I’m three years older than you were when you fought You-Know-
Who over the Sorcerer’s Stone,” she said fiercely, “and it’s because of
me Malfoy’s stuck back in Umbridge’s office with giant flying bogeys
attacking him —”
“Yeah, but —”
“We were all in the D.A. together,” said Neville quietly. “It was all
supposed to be about fighting You-Know-Who, wasn’t it? And this is
the first chance we’ve had to do something real — or was that all just
a game or something?”
“No — of course it wasn’t —” said Harry impatiently.
“Then we should come too,” said Neville simply. “We want to help.”
“That’s right,” said Luna, smiling happily.
Harry’s eyes met Ron’s. He knew that Ron was thinking exactly
what he was: If he could have chosen any members of the D.A. in ad-
dition to himself, Ron, and Hermione to join him in the attempt to
rescue Sirius, he would not have picked Ginny, Neville, or Luna.

761
CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
“Well, it doesn’t matter anyway,” said Harry frustratedly, “because
we still don’t know how to get there —”
“I thought we’d settled that?” said Luna maddeningly. “We’re
flying!”
“Look,” said Ron, barely containing his anger, “you might be able
to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us can’t sprout wings when-
ever we —”
“There are other ways of flying than with broomsticks,” said Luna
serenely.
“I s’pose we’re going to ride on the back of the Kacky Snorgle or
whatever it is?” Ron demanded.
“The Crumple-Horned Snorkack can’t fly,” said Luna in a dignified
voice, “but they can, and Hagrid says they’re very good at finding
places their riders are looking for.”
Harry whirled around. Standing between two trees, their white
eyes gleaming eerily, were two thestrals, watching the whispered con-
versation as though they understood every word.
“Yes!” he whispered, moving toward them. They tossed their reptil-
ian heads, throwing back long black manes, and Harry stretched out
his hand eagerly and patted the nearest one’s shining neck. How could
he ever have thought them ugly?
“Is it those mad horse things?” said Ron uncertainly, staring at a
point slightly to the left of the thestral Harry was patting. “Those ones
you can’t see unless you’ve watched someone snuff it?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“How many?”
“Just two.”
“Well, we need three,” said Hermione, who was still looking a lit-
tle shaken, but determined just the same.
“Four, Hermione,” said Ginny, scowling.
“I think there are six of us, actually,” said Luna calmly, counting.
“Don’t be stupid, we can’t all go!” said Harry angrily. “Look, you

762
FIGHT AND FLIGHT
three” — he pointed at Neville, Ginny, and Luna — “you’re not in-
volved in this, you’re not —”
They burst into more protests. His scar gave another, more painful,
twinge. Every moment they delayed was precious; he did not have
time to argue.
“Okay, fine, it’s your choice,” he said curtly. “But unless we can find
more thestrals you’re not going to be able —”
“Oh, more of them will come,” said Ginny confidently, who like
Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the
impression that she was looking at the horses.
“What makes you think that?”
“Because in case you hadn’t noticed, you and Hermione are both
covered in blood,” she said coolly, “and we know Hagrid lures thes-
trals with raw meat, so that’s probably why these two turned up in the
first place. . . .”
Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down
to see the closest thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with
Grawp’s blood.
“Okay, then,” he said, a bright idea occurring. “Ron and I will take
these two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three
and she’ll attract more thestrals —”
“I’m not staying behind!” said Hermione furiously.
“There’s no need,” said Luna, smiling. “Look, here come more
now. . . . You two must really smell. . . .”
Harry turned. No fewer than six or seven thestrals were picking
their way through the trees now, their great leathery wings folded
tight to their bodies, their eyes gleaming through the darkness. He
had no excuse now. . . .
“All right,” he said angrily, “pick one and get on, then.”

arry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest
thestral, placed a foot on a stump nearby, and scrambled
clumsily onto the horse’s silken back. It did not object, but twisted its
head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking
of his robes.
He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing
joints that made him feel more secure and looked around at the oth-
ers. Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next thestral and
was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature’s back.
Luna was already in place, sitting sidesaddle and adjusting her robes as
though she did this every day. Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, however,
were still standing motionless on the spot, openmouthed and staring.
“What?” he said.
“How’re we supposed to get on?” said Ron faintly. “When we can’t
see the things?”
“Oh it’s easy,” said Luna, sliding obligingly from her thestral and
marching over to him, Hermione, and Ginny. “Come here. . . .”


THE DEPARTMENT
OF MYSTERIES
She pulled them over to the other thestrals standing around and
one by one managed to help them onto the backs of their mounts. All
three looked extremely nervous as she wound their hands into the
horses’ manes and told them to grip tightly before getting back onto
her own steed.
“This is mad,” Ron said faintly, moving his free hand gingerly up
and down his horse’s neck. “Mad . . . if I could just see it —”
“You’d better hope it stays invisible,” said Harry darkly. “We all
ready, then?”
They all nodded and he saw five pairs of knees tighten beneath
their robes.
“Okay . . .”
He looked down at the back of his thestral’s glossy black head and
swallowed. “Ministry of Magic, visitors’ entrance, London, then,” he
said uncertainly. “Er . . . if you know . . . where to go . . .”
For a moment his thestral did nothing at all. Then, with a sweep-
ing movement that nearly unseated him, the wings on either side ex-
tended, the horse crouched slowly and then rocketed upward so fast
and so steeply that Harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly
around the horse to avoid sliding backward over its bony rump. He
closed his eyes and put his face down into the horse’s silky mane as
they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out
into a bloodred sunset.
Harry did not think he had ever moved so fast: The thestral
streaked over the castle, its wide wings hardly beating. The cooling air
was slapping Harry’s face; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind,
he looked around and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him,
each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their thestral to
protect themselves from its slipstream.
They were over the Hogwarts grounds, they had passed Hogs-
meade. Harry could see mountains and gullies below them. In the

765
CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
falling darkness Harry saw small collections of lights as they passed
over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was
beetling its way home through the hills. . . .
“This is bizarre!” Harry heard Ron yell from somewhere behind
him, and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this
height with no visible means of support. . . .
Twilight fell: The sky turned to a light, dusky purple littered with
tiny silver stars, and soon it was only the lights of Muggle towns that
gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were or how very
fast they were traveling. Harry’s arms were wrapped tightly around his
horse’s neck as he willed it to go even faster. How much time had
elapsed since he had seen Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries
floor? How much longer would he be able to resist Voldemort? All
Harry knew for sure was that Sirius had neither done as Voldemort
wanted, nor died, for he was convinced that either outcome would
cause him to feel Voldemort’s jubilation or fury course through his
own body, making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr.
Weasley was attacked. . . .
On they flew through the gathering darkness; Harry’s face felt stiff
and cold, his legs numb from gripping the thestral’s sides so tightly,
but he did not dare shift positions lest he slip. . . . He was deaf from
the thundering in his ears and his mouth was dry and frozen from the
rush of cold night air. He had lost all sense of how far they had come;
all his faith was in the beast below him, still streaking purposefully
through the night, barely flapping its wings as it sped ever onward. . . .
If they were too late . . .
He’s still alive, he’s still fighting, I can feel it. . . .
If Voldemort decided Sirius was not going to crack . . .
I’d know. . . .
Harry’s stomach gave a jolt. The thestral’s head was suddenly point-
ing toward the ground and he had actually slid forward a few inches
along its neck. They were descending at last. . . . He heard one of the

766
THE DEPARTMENT

girls shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously but could see
no sign of a falling body. . . . Presumably they had received a shock
from the change of position, just as he had. . . .
And now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on
all sides. They could see the tops of buildings, streams of headlights
like luminous insect eyes, squares of pale yellow that were windows.
Quite suddenly, it seemed, they were hurtling toward the pavement.
Harry gripped the thestral with every last ounce of his strength,
braced for a sudden impact, but the horse touched the dark ground as
lightly as a shadow and Harry slid from his back, looking around at
the street where the overflowing dumpster still stood a short way from
the vandalized telephone box, both drained of color in the flat orange
glare of the streetlights.
Ron landed a short way away and toppled immediately off his thes-
tral onto the pavement.
“Never again,” he said, struggling to his feet. He made as though to
stride away from his thestral, but, unable to see it, collided with its
hindquarters and almost fell over again. “Never, ever again . . . that
was the worst —”
Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him. Both
slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than Ron, though with
similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground. Neville
jumped down, shaking, but Luna dismounted smoothly.
“Where do we go from here, then?” she asked Harry in a politely
interested voice, as though this was all a rather interesting day-trip.
“Over here,” he said. He gave his thestral a quick, grateful pat, then
led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the
door. “Come on!” he urged the others as they hesitated.
Ron and Ginny marched in obediently; Hermione, Neville, and
Luna squashed themselves in after them; Harry took one glance back
at the thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the
dumpster, then forced himself into the box after Luna.

“Whoever’s nearest the receiver, dial six two four four two!” he said.
Ron did it, his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial. As it whirred
back into place the cool female voice sounded inside the box, “Wel-
come to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.”
“Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger,” Harry said very
quickly, “Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood . . .
We’re here to save someone, unless your Ministry can do it first!”
“Thank you,” said the cool female voice. “Visitors, please take the
badges and attach them to the front of your robes.”
Half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned
coins usually appeared. Hermione scooped them up and handed them
mutely to Harry over Ginny’s head; he glanced at the topmost one.

“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and
present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is lo-
cated at the far end of the Atrium.”
“Fine!” Harry said loudly, as his scar gave another throb. “Now can
we move?”
The floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose
up past the glass windows of the telephone box. The scavenging thes-
trals were sliding out of sight, blackness closed over their heads, and
with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Min-
istry of Magic.
A chink of soft golden light hit their feet and, widening, rose up
their bodies. Harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready as he
could in such cramped conditions, peering through the glass to see
whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed
to be completely empty. The light was dimmer than it had been by
day. There were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the

walls, but he saw as the lift slid smoothly to a halt that golden symbols
continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling.
“The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening,” said the
woman’s voice.
The door of the telephone box burst open; Harry toppled out of
it, followed by Neville and Luna. The only sound in the Atrium was
the steady rush of water from the golden fountain, where jets from the
wands of the witch and wizard, the point of the centaur’s arrow, the
tip of the goblin’s hat, and the house-elf ’s ears continued to gush into
the surrounding pool.
“Come on,” said Harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off
down the hall, Harry in the lead, past the fountain, toward the desk
where the security man who had weighed Harry’s wand had sat and
which was now deserted.
Harry felt sure that there ought to be a security person there, sure
that their absence was an ominous sign, and his feeling of foreboding
increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts. He
pressed the nearest down button and a lift clattered into sight almost
immediately, the golden grilles slid apart with a great, echoing clank-
ing, and they dashed inside. Harry stabbed the number nine button,
the grilles closed with a bang, and the lift began to descend, jangling
and rattling. Harry had not realized how noisy the lifts were on the
day that he had come with Mr. Weasley — he was sure that the din
would raise every security person within the building, yet when the
lift halted, the cool female voice said, “Department of Mysteries,” and
the grilles slid open again, they stepped out into the corridor where
nothing was moving but the nearest torches, flickering in the rush of
air from the lift.
Harry turned toward the plain black door. After months and
months of dreaming about it, he was here at last. . . .
“Let’s go,” he whispered, and he led the way down the corridor,
Luna right behind him, gazing around with her mouth slightly open.


CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
“Okay, listen,” said Harry, stopping again within six feet of the
door. “Maybe . . . maybe a couple of people should stay here as a —
as a lookout, and —”
“And how’re we going to let you know something’s coming?” asked
Ginny, her eyebrows raised. “You could be miles away.”
“We’re coming with you, Harry,” said Neville.
“Let’s get on with it,” said Ron firmly.
Harry still did not want to take them all with him, but it seemed he
had no choice. He turned to face the door and walked forward. Just as
it had in his dream, it swung open and he marched forward, leading
the others over the threshold.
They were standing in a large, circular room. Everything in here
was black including the floor and ceiling — identical, unmarked,
handle-less black doors were set at intervals all around the black walls,
interspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue, their
cool, shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor so that it
looked as though there was dark water underfoot.
“Someone shut the door,” Harry muttered.
He regretted giving this order the moment Neville had obeyed it.
Without the long chink of light from the torch-lit corridor behind
them, the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they
could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and
their ghostly reflections in the floor below.
In his dream, Harry had always walked purposefully across this
room to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on.
But there were around a dozen doors here. Just as he was gazing ahead
at the doors opposite him, trying to decide which was the right one,
there was a great rumbling noise and the candles began to move side-
ways. The circular wall was rotating.
Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm as though frightened the floor
might move too, but it did not. For a few seconds the blue flames
around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall sped

770
THE DEPARTMENT
OF MYSTERIES
around and then, quite as suddenly as it had started, the rumbling
stopped and everything became stationary once again.
Harry’s eyes had blue streaks burned into them; it was all he could
see.
“What was that about?” whispered Ron fearfully.
“I think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in from,”
said Ginny in a hushed voice.
Harry realized at once that she was right: He could no sooner have
picked the exit from the other doors than located an ant upon the jet-
black floor. Meanwhile, the door through which they needed to pro-
ceed could be any of the dozen surrounding them.
“How’re we going to get back out?” said Neville uncomfortably.
“Well, that doesn’t matter now,” said Harry forcefully, blinking to
try and erase the blue lines from his vision, and clutching his wand
tighter than ever. “We won’t need to get out till we’ve found Sirius —”
“Don’t go calling for him, though!” Hermione said urgently, but
Harry had never needed her advice less; his instinct was to keep as
quiet as possible for the time being.
“Where do we go, then, Harry?” Ron asked.
“I don’t —” Harry began. He swallowed. “In the dreams I went
through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark
room — that’s this one — and then I went through another door into
a room that kind of . . . glitters. We should try a few doors,” he said
hastily. “I’ll know the right way when I see it. C’mon.”
He marched straight at the door now facing him, the others follow-
ing close behind him, set his left hand against its cool, shining surface,
raised his wand, ready to strike the moment it opened, and pushed. It
swung open easily.
After the darkness of the first room, the lamps hanging low on
golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rec-
tangular room was much brighter, though there were no glittering,
shimmering lights such as Harry had seen in his dreams. The place

771
CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
was quite empty except for a few desks and, in the very middle of the
room, an enormous glass tank of deep-green water, big enough for all
of them to swim in, which contained a number of pearly white objects
that were drifting around lazily in the liquid.
“What’re those things?” whispered Ron.
“Dunno,” said Harry.
“Are they fish?” breathed Ginny.
“Aquavirius maggots!” said Luna excitedly. “Dad said the Ministry
were breeding —”
“No,” said Hermione. She sounded odd. She moved forward to
look through the side of the tank. “They’re brains.”
“Brains?”
“Yes . . . I wonder what they’re doing with them?”
Harry joined her at the tank. Sure enough, there could be no mis-
take now that he saw them at close quarters. Glimmering eerily they
drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green water, looking
something like slimy cauliflowers.
“Let’s get out of here,” said Harry. “This isn’t right, we need to try
another door —”
“There are doors here too,” said Ron, pointing around the walls.
Harry’s heart sank; how big was this place?
“In my dream I went through that dark room into the second one,”
he said. “I think we should go back and try from there.”
So they hurried back into the dark, circular room; the ghostly
shapes of the brains were now swimming before Harry’s eyes instead
of the blue candle flames.
“Wait!” said Hermione sharply, as Luna made to close the door of
the brain room behind them. “Flagrate!”
She drew with her wand in midair and a fiery X appeared on the
door. No sooner had the door clicked shut behind them than there
was a great rumbling, and once again the wall began to revolve very
fast, but now there was a great red-gold blur in amongst the faint blue,

772
THE DEPARTMENT
OF MYSTERIES
and when all became still again, the fiery cross still burned, showing
the door they had already tried.
“Good thinking,” said Harry. “Okay, let’s try this one —”
Again he strode directly at the door facing him and pushed it open,
his wand still raised, the others at his heels.
This room was larger than the last, dimly lit and rectangular, and the
center of it was sunken, forming a great stone pit some twenty feet be-
low them. They were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to
be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep
steps like an amphitheater, or the courtroom in which Harry had been
tried by the Wizengamot. Instead of a chained chair, however, there was
a raised stone dais in the center of the lowered floor, and upon this dais
stood a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked, and crumbling
that Harry was amazed the thing was still standing. Unsupported by
any surrounding wall, the archway was hung with a tattered black cur-
tain or veil which, despite the complete stillness of the cold surround-
ing air, was fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched.
“Who’s there?” said Harry, jumping down onto the bench below.
There was no answering voice, but the veil continued to flutter and sway.
“Careful!” whispered Hermione.
Harry scrambled down the benches one by one until he reached the
stone bottom of the sunken pit. His footsteps echoed loudly as he
walked slowly toward the dais. The pointed archway looked much
taller from where he stood now than when he had been looking down
on it from above. Still the veil swayed gently, as though somebody had
just passed through it.
“Sirius?” Harry spoke again, but much more quietly now that he
was nearer.
He had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right
behind the veil on the other side of the archway. Gripping his wand
very tightly, he edged around the dais, but there was nobody there. All
that could be seen was the other side of the tattered black veil.

773
CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
“Let’s go,” called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps. “This
isn’t right, Harry, come on, let’s go. . . .”
She sounded scared, much more scared than she had in the room
where the brains swam, yet Harry thought the archway had a kind of
beauty about it, old though it was. The gently rippling veil intrigued
him; he felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk
through it.
“Harry, let’s go, okay?” said Hermione more forcefully.
“Okay,” he said, but he did not move. He had just heard some-
thing. There were faint whispering, murmuring noises coming from
the other side of the veil.
“What are you saying?” he said very loudly, so that the words
echoed all around the surrounding stone benches.
“Nobody’s talking, Harry!” said Hermione, now moving over to
him.
“Someone’s whispering behind there,” he said, moving out of her
reach and continuing to frown at the veil. “Is that you, Ron?”
“I’m here, mate,” said Ron, appearing around the side of the arch-
way.
“Can’t anyone else hear it?” Harry demanded, for the whispering
and murmuring was becoming louder; without really meaning to put
it there, he found his foot was on the dais.
“I can hear them too,” breathed Luna, joining them around the
side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil. “There are people
in there!”
“What do you mean, ‘in there’?” demanded Hermione, jumping
down from the bottom step and sounding much angrier than the oc-
casion warranted. “There isn’t any ‘in there,’ it’s just an archway, there’s
no room for anybody to be there — Harry, stop it, come away —”
She grabbed his arm and pulled, but he resisted.
“Harry, we are supposed to be here for Sirius!” she said in a high-
pitched, strained voice.

774
THE DEPARTMENT
OF MYSTERIES
“Sirius,” Harry repeated, still gazing, mesmerized, at the continu-
ously swaying veil. “Yeah . . .”
And then something slid back into place in his brain: Sirius, cap-
tured, bound, and tortured, and he was staring at this archway. . . .
He took several paces back from the dais and wrenched his eyes
from the veil.
“Let’s go,” he said.
“That’s what I’ve been trying to — well, come on, then!” said
Hermione, and she led the way back around the dais. On the other
side, Ginny and Neville were staring, apparently entranced, at the veil
too. Without speaking, Hermione took hold of Ginny’s arm, Ron
Neville’s, and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone
bench and clambered all the way back up to the door.
“What d’you reckon that arch was?” Harry asked Hermione as they
regained the dark circular room.
“I don’t know, but whatever it was, it was dangerous,” she said
firmly, again inscribing a fiery cross upon the door.
Once more the wall spun and became still again. Harry approached
a door at random and pushed. It did not move.
“What’s wrong?” said Hermione.
“It’s . . . locked . . .” said Harry, throwing his weight at the door,
but it did not budge.
“This is it, then, isn’t it?” said Ron excitedly, joining Harry in the
attempt to force the door open. “Bound to be!”
“Get out of the way!” said Hermione sharply. She pointed her
wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door
and said, “Alohomora!”
Nothing happened.
“Sirius’s knife!” said Harry, and he pulled it out from inside his
robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall. The
others all watched eagerly as he ran it from top to bottom, withdrew
it, and then flung his shoulder again at the door. It remained as firmly

775
CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
shut as ever. What was more, when Harry looked down at the knife,
he saw that the blade had melted.
“Right, we’re leaving that room,” said Hermione decisively.
“But what if that’s the one?” said Ron, staring at it with a mixture
of apprehension and longing.
“It can’t be, Harry could get through all the doors in his dream,”
said Hermione, marking the door with another fiery cross as Harry re-
placed the now-useless handle of Sirius’s knife in his pocket.
“You know what could be in there?” said Luna eagerly, as the wall
started to spin yet again.
“Something blibbering, no doubt,” said Hermione under her
breath, and Neville gave a nervous little laugh.
The wall slid back to a halt and Harry, with a feeling of increasing
desperation, pushed the next door open.
“This is it!”
He knew it at once by the beautiful, dancing, diamond-sparkling
light. As Harry’s eyes became more accustomed to the brilliant glare
he saw clocks gleaming from every surface, large and small, grandfa-
ther and carriage, hanging in spaces between the bookcases or stand-
ing on desks ranging the length of the room, so that a busy, relentless
ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule, marching foot-
steps. The source of the dancing, diamond-bright light was a towering
crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room.
“This way!”
Harry’s heart was pumping frantically now that he knew they were
on the right track. He led the way forward down the narrow space be-
tween the lines of the desks, heading, as he had done in his dream, for
the source of the light, the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he was that
stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing, glittering
wind.
“Oh look !” said Ginny, as they drew nearer, pointing at the very
heart of the bell jar.

776
THE DEPARTMENT
OF MYSTERIES
Drifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny, jewel-
bright egg. As it rose in the jar it cracked open and a hummingbird
emerged, which was carried to the very top of the jar, but as it fell on
the draft, its feathers became bedraggled and damp again, and by the
time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been en-
closed once more in its egg.
“Keep going!” said Harry sharply, because Ginny showed signs of
wanting to stop and watch the egg’s progress back into a bird.
“You dawdled enough by that old arch!” she said crossly, but fol-
lowed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it.
“This is it,” Harry said again, and his heart was now pumping so
hard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech. “It’s through
here —”
He glanced around at them all. They had their wands out and
looked suddenly serious and anxious. He looked back at the door
and pushed. It swung open.
They were there, they had found the place: high as a church and
full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small, dusty, glass orbs.
They glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle brackets
set at intervals along the shelves. Like those in the circular room be-
hind them, their flames were burning blue. The room was very cold.
Harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles
between two rows of shelves. He could not hear anything nor see the
slightest sign of movement.
“You said it was row ninety-seven,” whispered Hermione.
“Yeah,” breathed Harry, looking up at the end of the closest row.
Beneath the branch of blue-glowing candles protruding from it glim-
mered the silver figure 53.
“We need to go right, I think,” whispered Hermione, squinting to
the next row. “Yes . . . that’s fifty-four. . . .”
“Keep your wands out,” Harry said softly.
They crept forward, staring behind them as they went on down the

777
CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
long alleys of shelves, the farther ends of which were in near total
darkness. Tiny, yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb
on the shelf. Some of them had a weird, liquid glow; others were as
dull and dark within as blown lightbulbs.
They passed row eighty-four . . . eighty-five . . . Harry was listen-
ing hard for the slightest sound of movement, but Sirius might be
gagged now, or else unconscious . . . or, said an unbidden voice inside
his head, he might already be dead. . . .
I’d have felt it, he told himself, his heart now hammering against his
Adam’s apple. I’d already know. . . .
“Ninety-seven!” whispered Hermione.
They stood grouped around the end of the row, gazing down the
alley beside it. There was nobody there.
“He’s right down at the end,” said Harry, whose mouth had be-
come slightly dry. “You can’t see properly from here. . . .”
And he led them forward, between the towering rows of glass balls,
some of which glowed softly as they passed. . . .
“He should be near here,” whispered Harry, convinced that every
step was going to bring the ragged form of Sirius into view upon the
darkened floor. “Anywhere here . . . really close . . .”
“Harry?” said Hermione tentatively, but he did not want to re-
spond. His mouth was very dry now.
“Somewhere about . . . here . . .” he said.
They had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim
candlelight. There was nobody there at all. All was echoing, dusty
silence.
“He might be . . .” Harry whispered hoarsely, peering down the
alley next door. “Or maybe . . .” He hurried to look down the one
beyond that.
“Harry?” said Hermione again.
“What?” he snarled.

778
THE DEPARTMENT
OF MYSTERIES
“I . . . I don’t think Sirius is here.”
Nobody spoke. Harry did not want to look at any of them. He felt
sick. He did not understand why Sirius was not here. He had to be
here. This was where he, Harry, had seen him. . . .
He ran up the space at the end of the rows, staring down them.
Empty aisle after empty aisle flickered past. He ran the other way,
back past his staring companions. There was no sign of Sirius any-
where, nor any hint of a struggle.
“Harry?” Ron called.
“What?”
He did not want to hear what Ron had to say, did not want to hear
Ron tell him he had been stupid, or suggest that they ought to go back
to Hogwarts. But the heat was rising in his face and he felt as though
he would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while be-
fore facing the brightness of the Atrium above and the others’ accus-
ing stares. . . .
“Have you seen this?” said Ron.
“What?” said Harry, but eagerly this time — it had to be a sign that
Sirius had been there, a clue — he strode back to where they were all
standing, a little way down row ninety-seven, but found nothing ex-
cept Ron staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelves.
“What?” Harry repeated glumly.
“It’s — it’s got your name on,” said Ron.
Harry moved a little closer. Ron was pointing at one of the small
glass spheres that glowed with a dull inner light, though it was very
dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many years.
“My name?” said Harry blankly.
He stepped forward. Not as tall as Ron, he had to crane his neck to
read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty
glass ball. In spidery writing was written a date of some sixteen years
previously, and below that:

779
CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
S. P. T. to A. P. W. B. D.
Dark Lord
and (?) Harry Potter
Harry stared at it.
“What is it?” Ron asked, sounding unnerved. “What’s your name
doing down here?”
He glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf.
“I’m not here,” he said, sounding perplexed. “None of the rest of us
are here. . . .”
“Harry, I don’t think you should touch it,” said Hermione sharply,
as he stretched out his hand.
“Why not?” he said. “It’s something to do with me, isn’t it?”
“Don’t, Harry,” said Neville suddenly. Harry looked around at
him. Neville’s round face was shining slightly with sweat. He looked
as though he could not take much more suspense.
“It’s got my name on,” said Harry.
And feeling slightly reckless, he closed his fingers around the dusty
ball’s surface. He had expected it to feel cold, but it did not. On the
contrary, it felt as though it had been lying in the sun for hours, as
though the glow of light within was warming it. Expecting, even hop-
ing, that something dramatic was going to happen, something excit-
ing that might make their long and dangerous journey worthwhile
after all, he lifted the glass ball down from its shelf and stared at it.
Nothing whatsoever happened. The others moved in closer around
Harry, gazing at the orb as he brushed it free of the clogging dust.
And then, from right behind them, a drawling voice said, “Very
good, Potter. Now turn around, nice and slowly, and give that to me.”


CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
BEYOND THE VEIL
B
lack shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them, block-
ing their way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a
dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts. Ginny gave
a gasp of horror.
“To me, Potter,” repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he
held out his hand, palm up.
Harry’s insides plummeted sickeningly. They were trapped and
outnumbered two to one.
“To me,” said Malfoy yet again.
“Where’s Sirius?” Harry said.
Several of the Death Eaters laughed. A harsh female voice from the
midst of the shadowy figures to Harry’s left said triumphantly, “The
Dark Lord always knows!”
“Always,” echoed Malfoy softly. “Now, give me the prophecy,
Potter.”
“I want to know where Sirius is!”
“I want to know where Sirius is!” mimicked the woman to his left.
She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were

781
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
mere feet away from Harry and the others, the light from their wands
dazzling Harry’s eyes.
“You’ve got him,” said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest,
the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-
seventh row. “He’s here. I know he is.”
“The little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was
twoo,” said the woman in a horrible, mock-baby voice. Harry felt Ron
stir beside him.
“Don’t do anything,” he muttered. “Not yet —”
The woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of
laughter.
“You hear him? You hear him? Giving instructions to the other chil-
dren as though he thinks of fighting us!”
“Oh, you don’t know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,” said Malfoy softly.
“He has a great weakness for heroics; the Dark Lord understands this
about him. Now give me the prophecy, Potter.”
“I know Sirius is here,” said Harry, though panic was causing his
chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly.
“I know you’ve got him!”
More of the Death Eaters laughed, though the woman still laughed
loudest of all.
“It’s time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Pot-
ter,” said Malfoy. “Now give me the prophecy, or we start using
wands.”
“Go on, then,” said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height. As
he did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna
rose on either side of him. The knot in Harry’s stomach tightened. If
Sirius really was not here, he had led his friends to their deaths for no
reason at all. . . .
But the Death Eaters did not strike.
“Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,” said Malfoy
coolly.

782
BEYOND THE VEIL
It was Harry’s turn to laugh.
“Yeah, right!” he said. “I give you this — prophecy, is it? And you’ll
just let us skip off home, will you?”
The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death
Eater shrieked, “Accio Proph —”
Harry was just ready for her. He shouted “Protego!” before she had
finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his
fingers he managed to cling on to it.
“Oh, he knows how to play, little bitty baby Potter,” she said, her
mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood. “Very well, then —”
“I TOLD YOU, NO!” Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman. “If you
smash it — !”
Harry’s mind was racing. The Death Eaters wanted this dusty
spun-glass sphere. He had no interest in it. He just wanted to get
them all out of this alive, make sure that none of his friends paid a ter-
rible price for his stupidity . . .
The woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off
her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange’s face, making it
gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow.
“You need more persuasion?” she said, her chest rising and falling
rapidly. “Very well — take the smallest one,” she ordered the Death
Eaters beside her. “Let him watch while we torture the little girl. I’ll
do it.”
Harry felt the others close in around Ginny. He stepped sideways
so that he was right in front of her, the prophecy held up to his chest.
“You’ll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us,” he told
Bellatrix. “I don’t think your boss will be too pleased if you come back
without it, will he?”
She did not move; she merely stared at him, the tip of her tongue
moistening her thin mouth.
“So,” said Harry, “what kind of prophecy are we talking about
anyway?”

783
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
He could not think what to do but to keep talking. Neville’s arm
was pressed against his, and he could feel him shaking. He could feel
one of the other’s quickened breath on the back of his head. He was
hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this, be-
cause his mind was blank.
“What kind of prophecy?” repeated Bellatrix, the grin fading from
her face. “You jest, Harry Potter.”
“Nope, not jesting,” said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater
to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they
could escape. “How come Voldemort wants it?”
Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses.
“You dare speak his name?” whispered Bellatrix.
“Yeah,” said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, ex-
pecting another attempt to bewitch it from him. “Yeah, I’ve got no
problem saying Vol —”
“Shut your mouth!” Bellatrix shrieked. “You dare speak his name
with your unworthy lips, you dare besmirch it with your half-blood’s
tongue, you dare —”
“Did you know he’s a half-blood too?” said Harry recklessly.
Hermione gave a little moan in his ear. “Voldemort? Yeah, his mother
was a witch but his dad was a Muggle — or has he been telling you lot
he’s pureblood?”
“STUPEF —”
“NO !”
A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange’s
wand, but Malfoy had deflected it. His spell caused hers to hit the
shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there
shattered.
Two figures, pearly white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled them-
selves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began
to speak. Their voices vied with each other, so that only fragments

784
BEYOND THE VEIL
of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix’s
shouts.
“. . . at the Solstice will come a new . . .” said the figure of an old,
bearded man.
“DO NOT ATTACK! WE NEED THE PROPHECY!”
“He dared — he dares —” shrieked Bellatrix incoherently. “— He
stands there — filthy half-blood —”
“WAIT UNTIL WE’VE GOT THE PROPHECY!” bawled Malfoy.
“. . . and none will come after . . .” said the figure of a young woman.
The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had
melted into thin air. Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile
homes but fragments of glass upon the floor. They had, however,
given Harry an idea. The problem was going to be conveying it to the
others.
“You haven’t told me what’s so special about this prophecy I’m sup-
posed to be handing over,” he said, playing for time. He moved his
foot slowly sideways, feeling around for someone else’s.
“Do not play games with us, Potter,” said Malfoy.
“I’m not playing games,” said Harry, half his mind on the conver-
sation, half on his wandering foot. And then he found someone’s toes
and pressed down upon them. A sharp intake of breath behind him
told him they were Hermione’s.
“What?” she whispered.
“Dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was
hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?” said Malfoy
sneeringly.
“I — what?” said Harry, and for a moment he quite forgot his plan.
“What about my scar?”
“What?” whispered Hermione more urgently behind him.
“Can this be?” said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some
of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of their

785

laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his lips as little as possi-
ble, “Smash shelves —”
“Dumbledore never told you?” Malfoy repeated. “Well, this ex-
plains why you didn’t come earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered
why —”
“— when I say go —”
“— you didn’t come running when he showed you the place where
it was hidden in your dreams. He thought natural curiosity would
make you want to hear the exact wording. . . .”
“Did he?” said Harry. Behind him he felt rather than heard
Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep
talking, to distract the Death Eaters. “So he wanted me to come and
get it, did he? Why?”
“Why?” Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted. “Because the
only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the De-
partment of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as
the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it
for him.”
“And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me?”
“About both of you, Potter, about both of you . . . Haven’t you ever
wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby?”
Harry stared into the slitted eyeholes through which Malfoy’s gray
eyes were gleaming. Was this prophecy the reason Harry’s parents had
died, the reason he carried his lightning-bolt scar? Was the answer to
all of this clutched in his hand?
“Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me?” he said
quietly, gazing at Lucius Malfoy, his fingers tightening over the warm
glass sphere in his hand. It was hardly larger than a Snitch and still
gritty with dust. “And he’s made me come and get it for him? Why
couldn’t he come and get it himself?”
“Get it himself?” shrieked Bellatrix on a cackle of mad laughter.

“The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so
sweetly ignoring his return? The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Au-
rors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear
cousin?”
“So he’s got you doing his dirty work for him, has he?” said Harry.
“Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it — and Bode?”
“Very good, Potter, very good . . .” said Malfoy slowly. “But the
Dark Lord knows you are not unintell —”
“NOW!” yelled Harry.
Five different voices behind him bellowed “REDUCTO !” Five
curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them
exploded as they hit. The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass
spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and
floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead
past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now rain-
ing down upon the floor —
“RUN!” Harry yelled, and as the shelves swayed precariously and
more glass spheres began to pour from above, he seized a handful of
Hermione’s robes and dragged her forward, one arm over his head as
chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them. A
Death Eater lunged forward through the cloud of dust and Harry el-
bowed him hard in the masked face. They were all yelling, there were
cries of pain, thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon them-
selves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their
spheres —
Harry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny, and Luna
sprint past him, their arms over their heads. Something heavy struck
him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and
sprinted onward; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard Her-
mione shout “Stupefy!” and the hand released him at once.
They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and


CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
began to sprint in earnest. He could hear footsteps right behind him
and Hermione’s voice urging Neville on. The door through which
they had come was ajar straight ahead, Harry could see the glittering
light of the bell jar, he pelted through it, the prophecy still clutched
tight and safe in his hand, waited for the others to hurtle over the
threshold before slamming the door behind them —
“Colloportus!” gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an
odd squelching noise.
“Where — where are the others?” gasped Harry.
He had thought that Ron, Luna, and Ginny had been ahead of
them, that they would be waiting in this room, but there was nobody
there.
“They must have gone the wrong way!” whispered Hermione, ter-
ror in her face.
“Listen!” whispered Neville.
Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just
sealed. Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius
Malfoy roar: “Leave Nott, leave him, I say, the Dark Lord will not care
for Nott’s injuries as much as losing that prophecy — Jugson, come
back here, we need to organize! We’ll split into pairs and search, and
don’t forget, be gentle with Potter until we’ve got the prophecy, you
can kill the others if necessary — Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the
left, Crabbe, Rabastan, go right — Jugson, Dolohov, the door straight
ahead — Macnair and Avery, through here — Rookwood, over
there — Mulciber, come with me!”
“What do we do?” Hermione asked Harry, trembling from head to
foot.
“Well, we don’t stand here waiting for them to find us, for a start,”
said Harry. “Let’s get away from this door. . . .”
They ran, quietly as they could, past the shimmering bell jar where
the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching, toward the exit into the

788
BEYOND THE VEIL
circular hallway at the far end of the room. They were almost there
when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door
Hermione had charmed shut.
“Stand aside!” said a rough voice. “Alohomora!”
As the door flew open, Harry, Hermione, and Neville dived under
desks. They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters’ robes
drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly.
“They might’ve run straight through to the hall,” said the rough
voice.
“Check under the desks,” said another.
Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend. Poking his wand out
from under the desk he shouted, “STUPEFY !”
A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backward into
a grandfather clock and knocked it over. The second Death Eater,
however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry’s spell and now pointed his
own wand at Hermione, who had crawled out from under the desk to
get a better aim.
“Avada —”
Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death
Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry.
Neville overturned his desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his wand
wildly at the struggling pair he cried, “EXPELLIARMUS !”
Both Harry’s and the Death Eater’s wands flew out of their hands
and soared back toward the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both
scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in
front and Harry hot on his heels, Neville bringing up the rear, plainly
horrorstruck at what he had done.
“Get out of the way, Harry!” yelled Neville, clearly determined to
repair the damage.
Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and
shouted, “STUPEFY !”

789
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eater’s shoulder and
hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hour-
glasses. The cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying every-
where, then sprang back up onto the wall, fully mended, then fell
down again, and shattered —
The Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor
beside the glittering bell jar. Harry ducked down behind another desk
as the man turned — his mask had slipped so that he could not see, he
ripped it off with his free hand and shouted, “STUP —”
“STUPEFY !” screamed Hermione, who had just caught up with
them. The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his
chest; he froze, his arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a
clatter and he collapsed backward toward the bell jar. Harry expected
to hear a clunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar onto
the floor, but instead, his head sank through the surface of the bell jar
as though it was nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest,
sprawled on his back on the table, with his head lying inside the jar
full of glittering wind.
“Accio Wand !” cried Hermione. Harry’s wand flew from a dark cor-
ner into her hand and she threw it to him.
“Thanks,” he said, “right, let’s get out of —”
“Look out!” said Neville, horrified, staring at the Death Eater’s
head in the bell jar.
All three of them raised their wands again, but none of them
struck. They were all gazing, openmouthed, appalled, at what was
happening to the man’s head.
It was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair
and stubble retracting into his skull, his cheeks smooth, his skull
round and covered with a peachlike fuzz. . . .
A baby’s head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled
neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again. But even as
they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previ-

790
BEYOND THE VEIL
ous proportions again, thick black hair was sprouting from the pate
and chin. . . .
“It’s time,” said Hermione in an awestruck voice. “Time . . .”
The Death Eater shook his ugly head again, trying to clear it, but
before he could pull himself together again, it began to shrink back to
babyhood once more. . . .
There was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream.
“RON?” Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous trans-
formation taking place before them. “GINNY? LUNA?”
“Harry!” Hermione screamed.
The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar. His ap-
pearance was utterly bizarre, his tiny baby’s head bawling loudly while
his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions, narrowly missing
Harry, who ducked. Harry raised his wand but to his amazement
Hermione seized his arm.
“You can’t hurt a baby!”
There was no time to argue the point. Harry could hear more foot-
steps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy they had just left and
knew, too late, that he ought not to have shouted and given away their
position.
“Come on!” he said again, and leaving the ugly baby-headed Death
Eater staggering behind them, they took off for the door that stood
ajar at the other end of the room, leading back into the black hallway.
They had run halfway toward it when Harry saw through the open
door two more Death Eaters running across the black room toward
them. Veering left he burst instead into a small, dark, cluttered office
and slammed the door behind them.
“Collo —” began Hermione, but before she could complete the spell
the door had burst open again and the two Death Eaters had come
hurtling inside. With a cry of triumph, both yelled, “IMPEDIMENTA!”
Harry, Hermione, and Neville were all knocked backward off their
feet. Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view,

791
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a
cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry’s head slammed into the
stone wall behind him, tiny lights burst in front of his eyes, and for a
moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react.
“WE’VE GOT HIM!” yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry, “IN
AN OFFICE OFF —”
“Silencio!” cried Hermione, and the man’s voice was extinguished.
He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound
came out; he was thrust aside by his fellow.
“Petrificus Totalus!” shouted Harry, as the second Death Eater raised
his wand. His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forward,
facedown onto the rug at Harry’s feet, stiff as a board and unable to
move at all.
“Well done, Ha —”
But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sud-
den slashing movement with his wand from which flew a streak of
what looked like purple flame. It passed right across Hermione’s chest;
she gave a tiny “oh!” as though of surprise and then crumpled onto the
floor where she lay motionless.
“HERMIONE!”
Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly toward
her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of him. The Death
Eater kicked out hard at Neville’s head as he emerged — his foot
broke Neville’s wand in two and connected with his face — Neville
gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching his mouth and nose. Harry
twisted around, his own wand held high, and saw that the Death
Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at
Harry, who recognized the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily
Prophet: Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the
Prewetts.
Dolohov grinned. With his free hand, he pointed from the
prophecy still clutched in Harry’s hand, to himself, then at Hermione.

792
BEYOND THE VEIL
Though he could no longer speak his meaning could not have been
clearer: Give me the prophecy, or you get the same as her. . . .
“Like you won’t kill us all the moment I hand it over anyway!” said
Harry.
A whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking
properly. He had one hand on Hermione’s shoulder, which was still
warm, yet did not dare look at her properly. Don’t let her be dead, don’t
let her be dead, it’s my fault if she’s dead. . . .
“Whaddever you do, Harry,” said Neville fiercely from under the
desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood
pouring down his mouth and chin, “don’d gib it to him!”
Then there was a crash outside the door, and Dolohov looked over
his shoulder — the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the
doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at
everything around him.
Harry seized his chance: “PETRIFICUS TOTALUS!”
The spell hit Dolohov before he could block it, and he toppled for-
ward across his comrade, both of them rigid as boards and unable to
move an inch.
“Hermione,” Harry said at once, shaking her as the baby-headed
Death Eater blundered out of sight again. “Hermione, wake up. . . .”
“Whaddid he do to her?” said Neville, crawling out from under the
desk again to kneel at her other side, blood streaming from his rapidly
swelling nose. “I dunno. . . .”
Neville groped for Hermione’s wrist.
“Dat’s a pulse, Harry, I’b sure id is. . . .”
Such a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a mo-
ment he felt light-headed.
“She’s alive?”
“Yeah, I dink so. . . .”
There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sounds of

793
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
more footsteps, but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunder-
ings of the baby Death Eater in the next room.
“Neville, we’re not far from the exit,” Harry whispered. “We’re
right next to that circular room. . . . If we can just get you across it
and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I’ll bet
you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift. . . . Then you
could find someone. . . . Raise the alarm . . .”
“And whad are you going do do?” said Neville, mopping his bleed-
ing nose with his sleeve and frowning at Harry.
“I’ve got to find the others,” said Harry.
“Well, I’b going do find dem wid you,” said Neville firmly.
“But Hermione —”
“We’ll dake her wid us,” said Neville firmly. “I’ll carry her — you’re
bedder at fighding dem dan I ab —”
He stood up and seized one of Hermione’s arms, glared at Harry,
who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione’s
limp form over Neville’s shoulders.
“Wait,” said Harry, snatching up Hermione’s wand from the floor
and shoving it into Nevilles hand, “you’d better take this. . . .”
Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they
walked slowly toward the door.
“My gran’s going do kill be,” said Neville thickly, blood spattering
from his nose as he spoke, “dat was by dad’s old wand. . . .”
Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously.
The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into
things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling
and confused, while the glass cabinet that Harry now suspected had
contained Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter, and repair itself on
the wall behind them.
“He’s never going to notice us,” he whispered. “C’mon . . . keep
close behind me. . . .”

794
BEYOND THE VEIL
They crept out of the office and back toward the door into the
black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted. They walked a
few steps forward, Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione’s
weight. The door of the Time Room swung shut behind them, and
the walls began to rotate once more. The recent blow on the back of
Harry’s head seemed to have unsteadied him; he narrowed his eyes,
swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again. With a sinking
heart Harry saw that Hermione’s fiery crosses had faded from the
doors.
“So which way d’you reck — ?”
But before they could make a decision as to which way to try, a
door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it.
“Ron!” croaked Harry, dashing toward them. “Ginny — are you
all — ?”
“Harry,” said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forward, seizing the
front of Harry’s robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes. “There
you are. . . . Ha ha ha . . . You look funny, Harry. . . . You’re all messed
up. . . .
Ron’s face was very white and something dark was trickling from
the corner of his mouth. Next moment his knees had given way, but
he still clutched the front of Harry’s robes, so that Harry was pulled
into a kind of bow.
“Ginny?” Harry said fearfully. “What happened?”
But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting po-
sition, panting and holding her ankle.
“I think her ankle’s broken, I heard something crack,” whispered
Luna, who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt.
“Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets, it was a very
odd place, some of the time we were just floating in the dark —”
“Harry, we saw Uranus up close!” said Ron, still giggling feebly.
“Get it, Harry? We saw Uranus — ha ha ha —”

795
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron’s mouth and burst.
“Anyway, one of them grabbed Ginny’s foot, I used the Reductor
Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but . . .”
Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very
shallow way, her eyes still closed.
“And what about Ron?” said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to
giggle, still hanging off the front of Harry’s robes.
“I don’t know what they hit him with,” said Luna sadly, “but he’s
gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all. . . .”
“Harry,” said Ron, pulling Harry’s ear down to his mouth and still
giggling weakly, “you know who this girl is, Harry? She’s Loony . . .
Loony Lovegood . . . ha ha ha . . .”
“We’ve got to get out of here,” said Harry firmly. “Luna, can you
help Ginny?”
“Yes,” said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping,
putting an arm around Ginny’s waist and pulling her up.
“It’s only my ankle, I can do it myself!” said Ginny impatiently, but
next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for sup-
port. Harry pulled Ron’s arm over his shoulder just as, so many
months ago, he had pulled Dudley’s. He looked around: They had a
one-in-twelve chance of getting the exit right the first time —
He heaved Ron toward a door; they were within a few feet of it
when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters
sped into the hall, led by Bellatrix Lestrange.
“There they are!” she shrieked.
Stunning Spells shot across the room: Harry smashed his way
through the door ahead, flung Ron unceremoniously from him, and
ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione. They were all over the
threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix.
“Colloportus!” shouted Harry, and he heard three bodies slam into
the door on the other side.

796
BEYOND THE VEIL
“It doesn’t matter!” said a man’s voice. “There are other ways in —
WE’VE GOT THEM, THEY’RE HERE!”
Harry spun around. They were back in the Brain Room and, sure
enough, there were doors all around the walls. He could hear footsteps
in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join
the first.
“Luna — Neville — help me!”
The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they
went: Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his
haste to reach the next door.
“Colloportus!”
There were footsteps running along behind the doors; every now
and then another heavy body would launch itself against one, so it
creaked and shuddered. Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors
along the opposite wall — then, as Harry reached the very top of the
room, he heard Luna cry, “Collo — aaaaaaaaargh . . .”
He turned in time to see her flying through the air. Five Death
Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not
reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and onto the
floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still as Hermione.
“Get Potter!” shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him. He dodged her
and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought
they might hit the prophecy —
“Hey!” said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now totter-
ing drunkenly toward Harry, giggling. “Hey, Harry, there are brains in
here, ha ha ha, isn’t that weird, Harry?”
“Ron, get out of the way, get down —”
But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank.
“Honest, Harry, they’re brains — look — Accio Brain!”
The scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry, Ginny, and Neville
and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch

797
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leap-
ing fish. For a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared
toward Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of
moving images flew from it, unraveling like rolls of film —
“Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it —” said Ron, watching it disgorge its
gaudy innards. “Harry, come and touch it, bet it’s weird —”
“RON, NO!”
Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tenta-
cles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would
not be anything good. He darted forward but Ron had already caught
the brain in his outstretched hands.
The moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began
wrapping themselves around Ron’s arms like ropes.
“Harry, look what’s happen — no — no, I don’t like it — no,
stop — stop —”
But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron’s chest now. He
tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like
an octopus’s body.
“Diffindo!” yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping them-
selves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break.
Ron fell over, still thrashing against his bonds.
“Harry, it’ll suffocate him!” screamed Ginny, immobilized by her
broken ankle on the floor — then a jet of red light flew from one of
the Death Eater’s wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled
over sideways and lay there unconscious.
“STUBEFY !” shouted Neville, wheeling around and waving
Hermione’s wand at the oncoming Death Eaters. “STUBEFY,
STUBEFY !”
But nothing happened — one of the Death Eaters shot their own
Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him by inches. Harry and Neville
were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of
whom sent streams of silver light like arrows past them that left craters


BEYOND THE VEIL
in the wall behind them. Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange
sprinted right at him. Holding the prophecy high above his head he
sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw
the Death Eaters away from the others.
It seemed to have worked. They streaked after him, knocking chairs
and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the
prophecy, and he dashed through the only door still open, the one
through which the Death Eaters themselves had come. Inwardly pray-
ing that Neville would stay with Ron — find some way of releasing
him — he ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor
vanish —
He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bounc-
ing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath
out of his body, he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the
stone archway stood on its dais. The whole room was ringing with the
Death Eaters’ laughter. He looked up and saw the five who had been
in the Brain Room descending toward him, while as many more
emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to
bench toward him. Harry got to his feet though his legs were trem-
bling so badly they barely supported him. The prophecy was still
miraculously unbroken in his left hand, his wand clutched tightly in
his right. He backed away, looking around, trying to keep all the
Death Eaters within his sights. The back of his legs hit something
solid; he had reached the dais where the archway stood. He climbed
backward onto it.
The Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him. Some were panting as
hard as he was. One was bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the full
Body-Bind, was leering, his wand pointing straight at Harry’s face.
“Potter, your race is run,” drawled Lucius Malfoy, pulling off his
mask. “Now hand me the prophecy like a good boy. . . .”
“Let — let the others go, and I’ll give it to you!” said Harry
desperately.

799
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
A few of the Death Eaters laughed.
“You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,” said Lucius Malfoy,
his pale face flushed with pleasure. “You see, there are ten of us and
only one of you . . . or hasn’t Dumbledore ever taught you how to
count?”
“He’s dot alone!” shouted a voice from above them. “He’s still god
be!”
Harry’s heart sank. Neville was scrambling down the stone benches
toward them, Hermione’s wand held fast in his trembling hand.
“Neville — no — go back to Ron —”
“STUBEFY !” Neville shouted again, pointing his wand at each
Death Eater in turn, “STUBEFY ! STUBE —”
One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind, pin-
ioning his arms to his sides. He struggled and kicked; several of the
Death Eaters laughed.
“It’s Longbottom, isn’t it?” sneered Lucius Malfoy. “Well, your
grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause. . . . Your
death will not come as a great shock. . . .”
“Longbottom?” repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her
gaunt face. “Why, I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents,
boy. . . .”
“I DOE YOU HAB!” roared Neville, and he fought so hard against
his captor’s encircling grip that the Death Eater shouted, “Someone
Stun him!”
“No, no, no,” said Bellatrix. She looked transported, alive with ex-
citement as she glanced at Harry, then back at Neville. “No, let’s see
how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents. . . . Un-
less Potter wants to give us the prophecy —”
“DON’D GIB ID DO DEM!” roared Neville, who seemed beside
himself, kicking and writhing as Bellatrix drew nearer to him and his
captor, her wand raised. “DON’D GIB ID DO DEM, HARRY!”
Bellatrix raised her wand. “Crucio!”


BEYOND THE VEIL
Neville screamed, his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death
Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground. The
Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor, twitching and
screaming in agony.
“That was just a taster!” said Bellatrix, raising her wand so that
Neville’s screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet. She turned
and gazed up at Harry. “Now, Potter, either give us the prophecy, or
watch your little friend die the hard way!”
Harry did not have to think; there was no choice. The prophecy
was hot with the heat from his clutching hand as he held it out. Mal-
foy jumped forward to take it.
Then, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more
people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks, and
Kingsley.
Malfoy turned and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a
Stunning Spell right at him. Harry did not wait to see whether it had
made contact, but dived off the dais out of the way. The Death Eaters
were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the
Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped
from step to step toward the sunken floor: Through the darting bod-
ies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville crawling along. He
dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to
reach Neville.
“Are you okay?” he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their
heads.
“Yes,” said Neville, trying to pull himself up.
“And Ron?”
“I dink he’s all right — he was still fighding the brain when I
left —”
The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a
crater right where Neville’s hand had been seconds before. Both
scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere,

801
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes
were barely touching the floor.
“Give it to me,” growled a voice in his ear, “give me the
prophecy —”
The man was pressing so tightly on Harry’s windpipe that he could
not breathe — through watering eyes he saw Sirius dueling with a
Death Eater some ten feet away. Kingsley was fighting two at once;
Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bel-
latrix — nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying. . . . He
turned his wand backward toward the man’s side, but had no breath
to utter an incantation, and the man’s free hand was groping toward
the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy —
“AARGH!”
Neville had come lunging out of nowhere: Unable to articulate a
spell, he had jabbed Hermione’s wand hard into the eyehole of the
Death Eater’s mask. The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of
pain and Harry whirled around to face him and gasped, “STUPEFY !”
The Death Eater keeled over backward and his mask slipped off. It
was Macnair, Buckbeak’s would-be killer, one of his eyes now swollen
and bloodshot.
“Thanks!” Harry said to Neville, pulling him aside as Sirius and his
Death Eater lurched past, dueling so fiercely that their wands were
blurs. Then Harry’s foot made contact with something round and
hard and he slipped — for a moment he thought he had dropped the
prophecy, then saw Moody’s magic eye spinning away across the floor.
Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his at-
tacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his
long pale face twisted with glee.
“Tarantallegra!” he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose
legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap dance, unbalancing
him and causing him to fall to the floor again. “Now, Potter —”


BEYOND THE VEIL
He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had
used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, “Protego!”
Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife but the
force of it knocked him sideways, and he fell over Neville’s jerking
legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell.
Dolohov raised his wand again. “Accio Proph —”
Sirius hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder,
and sent him flying out of the way. The prophecy had again flown to
the tips of Harry’s fingers but he had managed to cling to it. Now Sir-
ius and Dolohov were dueling, their wands flashing like swords,
sparks flying from their wand tips —
Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement
he had used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled,
“Petrificus Totalus!” Once again, Dolohov’s arms and legs snapped to-
gether and he keeled over backward, landing with a crash on his back.
“Nice one!” shouted Sirius, forcing Harry’s head down as a pair of
Stunning Spells flew toward them. “Now I want you to get out of —”
They both ducked again. A jet of green light had narrowly missed
Sirius; across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the
stone steps, her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat, and
Bellatrix, triumphant, running back toward the fray.
“Harry, take the prophecy, grab Neville, and run!” Sirius yelled,
dashing to meet Bellatrix. Harry did not see what happened next:
Kingsley swayed across his field of vision, battling with the pock-
marked Rookwood, now mask-less; another jet of green light flew
over Harry’s head as he launched himself toward Neville —
“Can you stand?” he bellowed in Neville’s ear, as Neville’s legs jerked
and twitched uncontrollably. “Put your arm round my neck —”
Neville did so — Harry heaved — Neville’s legs were still flying in
every direction, they would not support him and then, out of
nowhere, a man lunged at them. Both fell backward, Neville’s legs


CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
waving wildly like an overturned beetle’s, Harry with his left arm held
up in the air to try and save the small glass ball from being smashed.
“The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!” snarled Lucius Mal-
foy’s voice in his ear, and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy’s wand pressing
hard between his ribs.
“No — get — off — me . . . Neville — catch it!”
Harry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville spun himself
around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest. Malfoy pointed
the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over
his shoulder and yelled, “Impedimenta!”
Malfoy was blasted off his back. As Harry scrambled up again he
looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius
and Bellatrix were now dueling. Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and
Neville again, but before he could draw breath to strike, Lupin had
jumped between them.
“Harry, round up the others and GO!”
Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him
bodily onto the first tier of stone steps. Neville’s legs twitched and
jerked and would not support his weight. Harry heaved again with all
the strength he possessed and they climbed another step —
A spell hit the stone bench at Harry’s heel. It crumbled away and
he fell back to the step below: Neville sank to the ground, his legs still
jerking and thrashing, and thrust the prophecy into his pocket.
“Come on!” said Harry desperately, hauling at Neville’s robes. “Just
try and push with your legs —”
He gave another stupendous heave and Neville’s robes tore all along
the left seam — the small spun-glass ball dropped from his pocket
and before either of them could catch it, one of Neville’s floundering
feet kicked it. It flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the
step beneath them. As both of them stared at the place where it had
broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with

804
BEYOND THE VEIL
hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any but them.
Harry could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams
and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he
hear. The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness.
“Harry, I’b sorry!” cried Neville, his face anguished as his legs con-
tinued to flounder, “I’b so sorry, Harry, I didn’d bean do —”
“It doesn’t matter!” Harry shouted. “Just try and stand, let’s get out
of —”
“Dubbledore!” said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported,
staring over Harry’s shoulder.
“What?”
“DUBBLEDORE!”
Harry turned to look where Neville was staring. Directly above
them, framed in the doorway from the Brain Room, stood Albus
Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his face white and furious. Harry felt a
kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body — they
were saved.
Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry, who had
no more thought of leaving. Dumbledore was already at the foot of
the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized he was there. There
were yells; one of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey
up the stone steps opposite. Dumbledore’s spell pulled him back as
easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible
line —
Only one couple were still battling, apparently unaware of the new
arrival. Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix’s jet of red light: He was laugh-
ing at her. “Come on, you can do better than that!” he yelled, his voice
echoing around the cavernous room.
The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest.
The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened
in shock.

805
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so. He was
jumping down the steps again, pulling out his wand, as Dumbledore
turned to the dais too.
It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall. His body curved in a grace-
ful arc as he sank backward through the ragged veil hanging from the
arch. . . .
And Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his god-
father’s wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient
doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a mo-
ment as though in a high wind and then fell back into place.
Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange’s triumphant scream, but knew it
meant nothing — Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, he
would reappear from the other side any second. . . .
But Sirius did not reappear.
“SIRIUS!” Harry yelled, “SIRIUS!”
He had reached the floor, his breath coming in searing gasps. Sirius
must be just behind the curtain, he, Harry, would pull him back out
again. . . .
But as he reached the ground and sprinted toward the dais, Lupin
grabbed Harry around the chest, holding him back.
“There’s nothing you can do, Harry —”
“Get him, save him, he’s only just gone through!”
“It’s too late, Harry —”
“We can still reach him —”
Harry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go. . . .
“There’s nothing you can do, Harry . . . nothing. . . . He’s gone.”

CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX

H
e hasn’t gone!” Harry yelled.
He did not believe it, he would not believe it; still he
fought Lupin with every bit of strength he had: Lupin did not under-
stand, people hid behind that curtain, he had heard them whispering
the first time he had entered the room — Sirius was hiding, simply
lurking out of sight —
“SIRIUS!” he bellowed, “SIRIUS!”
“He can’t come back, Harry,” said Lupin, his voice breaking as he
struggled to contain Harry. “He can’t come back, because he’s d —”
“HE — IS — NOT — DEAD!” roared Harry. “SIRIUS!”
There was movement going on around them, pointless bustling,
the flashes of more spells. To Harry it was meaningless noise, the de-
flected curses flying past them did not matter, nothing mattered ex-
cept that Lupin stop pretending that Sirius, who was standing feet
from them behind that old curtain, was not going to emerge at any
moment, shaking back his dark hair and eager to reenter the battle —
Lupin dragged Harry away from the dais, Harry still staring at the
archway, angry at Sirius now for keeping him waiting —

807
CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
But some part of him realized, even as he fought to break free from
Lupin, that Sirius had never kept him waiting before. . . . Sirius had
risked everything, always, to see Harry, to help him. . . . If Sirius was
not reappearing out of that archway when Harry was yelling for him
as though his life depended on it, the only possible explanation was
that he could not come back. . . . That he really was . . .
Dumbledore had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in
the middle of the room, seemingly immobilized by invisible ropes.
Mad-Eye Moody had crawled across the room to where Tonks lay and
was attempting to revive her. Behind the dais there were still flashes of
light, grunts, and cries — Kingsley had run forward to continue Sir-
ius’s duel with Bellatrix.
“Harry?”
Neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place
where Harry stood. Harry was no longer struggling against Lupin,
who maintained a precautionary grip on his arm nevertheless.
“Harry . . . I’b really sorry. . . .” said Neville. His legs were still
dancing uncontrollably. “Was dat man — was Sirius Black a — a
friend of yours?”
Harry nodded.
“Here,” said Lupin quietly, and pointing his wand at Neville’s legs
he said, “Finite.” The spell was lifted. Neville’s legs fell back onto the
floor and remained still. Lupin’s face was pale. “Let’s — let’s find the
others. Where are they all, Neville?”
Lupin turned away from the archway as he spoke. It sounded as
though every word was causing him pain.
“Dey’re all back dere,” said Neville. “A brain addacked Ron bud I
dink he’s all righd — and Herbione’s unconscious, bud we could feel
a bulse —”
There was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais. Harry saw
Kingsley, yelling in pain, hit the ground. Bellatrix Lestrange turned

tail and ran as Dumbledore whipped around. He aimed a spell at her
but she deflected it. She was halfway up the steps now —
“Harry — no!” cried Lupin, but Harry had already ripped his arm
from Lupin’s slackened grip.
“SHE KILLED SIRIUS!” bellowed Harry. “SHE KILLED HIM
— I’LL KILL HER!”
And he was off, scrambling up the stone benches. People were
shouting behind him but he did not care. The hem of Bellatrix’s robes
whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the
brains were swimming. . . .
She aimed a curse over her shoulder. The tank rose into the air and
tipped. Harry was deluged in the foul-smelling potion within. The
brains slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long, col-
ored tentacles, but he shouted, “Wingardium Leviosa!” and they flew
into the air away from him. Slipping and sliding he ran on toward the
door. He leapt over Luna, who was groaning on the floor, past Ginny,
who said, “Harry — what — ?” past Ron, who giggled feebly, and
Hermione, who was still unconscious. He wrenched open the door
into the circular black hall and saw Bellatrix disappearing through a
door on the other side of the room — beyond her was the corridor
leading back to the lifts.
He ran, but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls
had begun to rotate again. Once more he was surrounded by streaks
of blue light from the whirling candelabra.
“Where’s the exit?” he shouted desperately, as the wall rumbled to a
halt again. “Where’s the way out?”
The room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask. The door
right behind him flew open, and the corridor toward the lifts stretched
ahead of him, torch-lit and empty. He ran. . . .
He could hear a lift clattering ahead of him. He sprinted up the
passageway, swung around the corner, and slammed his fist onto the


CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
button to call a second lift. It jangled and banged lower and lower; the
grilles slid open and Harry dashed inside, now hammering the button
marked Atrium. The doors slid shut and he was rising. . . .
He forced his way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open
and looked around. Bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at the
other end of the hall, but she looked back as he sprinted toward her,
and aimed another spell at him. He dodged behind the Fountain of
Magical Brethren; the spell zoomed past him and hit the wrought gold
gates at the other end of the Atrium so that they rang like bells. There
were no more footsteps. She had stopped running. He crouched be-
hind the statues, listening.
“Come out, come out, little Harry!” she called in her mock-baby voice,
which echoed off the polished wooden floors. “What did you come af-
ter me for, then? I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin!”
“I am!” shouted Harry, and a score of ghostly Harry’s seemed to
chorus I am! I am! I am! all around the room.
“Aaaaaah . . . did you love him, little baby Potter?”
Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before. He flung
himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed “Crucio!”
Bellatrix screamed. The spell had knocked her off her feet, but she
did not writhe and shriek with pain as Neville had — she was already
on her feet again, breathless, no longer laughing. Harry dodged be-
hind the golden fountain again — her counterspell hit the head of the
handsome wizard, which was blown off and landed twenty feet away,
gouging long scratches into the wooden floor.
“Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?” she
yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. “You need to mean
them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain — to enjoy it —
righteous anger won’t hurt me for long — I’ll show you how it is
done, shall I? I’ll give you a lesson —”
Harry had been edging around the fountain on the other side. She
screamed, “Crucio!” and he was forced to duck down again as the cen-

taur’s arm, holding its bow, spun off and landed with a crash on the
floor a short distance from the golden wizard’s head.
“Potter, you cannot win against me!” she cried. He could hear her
moving to the right, trying to get a clear shot of him. He backed
around the statue away from her, crouching behind the centaur’s legs,
his head level with the house-elf ’s. “I was and am the Dark Lord’s
most loyal servant, I learned the Dark Arts from him, and I know
spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to
compete —”
“Stupefy!” yelled Harry. He had edged right around to where the
goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at
her back as she peered around the fountain for him. She reacted so fast
he barely had time to duck.
“Protego!”
The jet of red light, his own Stunning Spell, bounced back at him.
Harry scrambled back behind the fountain, and one of the goblin’s
ears went flying across the room.
“Potter, I am going to give you one chance!” shouted Bellatrix.
“Give me the prophecy — roll it out toward me now — and I may
spare your life!”
“Well, you’re going to have to kill me, because it’s gone!” Harry
roared — and as he shouted it, pain seared across his forehead. His
scar was on fire again, and he felt a surge of fury that was quite un-
connected with his own rage. “And he knows!” said Harry with a mad
laugh to match Bellatrix’s own. “Your dear old mate Voldemort knows
it’s gone! He’s not going to be happy with you, is he?”
“What? What do you mean?” she cried, and for the first time there
was fear in her voice.
“The prophecy smashed when I was trying to get Neville up the
steps! What do you think Voldemort’ll say about that, then?”
His scar seared and burned. . . . The pain of it was making his eyes
stream. . . .

811
CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
“LIAR!” she shrieked, but he could hear the terror behind the anger
now. “YOU’VE GOT IT, POTTER, AND YOU WILL GIVE IT
TO ME — Accio Prophecy! ACCIO PROPHECY !”
Harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her, the
pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst.
He waved his empty hand from behind the one-eared goblin and
withdrew it quickly as she sent another jet of green light flying at him.
“Nothing there!” he shouted. “Nothing to summon! It smashed
and nobody heard what it said, tell your boss that —”
“No!” she screamed. “It isn’t true, you’re lying — MASTER, I
TRIED, I TRIED — DO NOT PUNISH ME —”
“Don’t waste your breath!” yelled Harry, his eyes screwed up against
the pain in his scar, now more terrible than ever. “He can’t hear you
from here!”
“Can’t I, Potter?” said a high, cold voice.
Harry opened his eyes.
Tall, thin, and black-hooded, his terrible snakelike face white and
gaunt, his scarlet, slit-pupiled eyes staring . . . Lord Voldemort had
appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand pointing at Harry who
stood frozen, quite unable to move.
“So you smashed my prophecy?” said Voldemort softly, staring at
Harry with those pitiless red eyes. “No, Bella, he is not lying. . . . I see
the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind. . . . Months
of preparation, months of effort . . . and my Death Eaters have let
Harry Potter thwart me again. . . .”
“Master, I am sorry, I knew not, I was fighting the Animagus
Black!” sobbed Bellatrix, flinging herself down at Voldemort’s feet as
he paced slowly nearer. “Master, you should know —”
“Be quiet, Bella,” said Voldemort dangerously. “I shall deal with
you in a moment. Do you think I have entered the Ministry of Magic
to hear your sniveling apologies?”
“But Master — he is here — he is below —”

812
THE ONLY ONE
HE EVER FEARED
Voldemort paid no attention.
“I have nothing more to say to you, Potter,” he said quietly. “You
have irked me too often, for too long. AVADA KEDAVRA!”
Harry had not even opened his mouth to resist. His mind was
blank, his wand pointing uselessly at the floor.
But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had
sprung alive, leaping from its plinth, and landed on the floor with a
crash between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced off its
chest as the statue flung out its arms, protecting Harry.
“What — ?” said Voldemort, staring around. And then he
breathed, “Dumbledore!”
Harry looked behind him, his heart pounding. Dumbledore was
standing in front of the golden gates.
Voldemort raised his wand and sent another jet of green light at
Dumbledore, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak;
next second he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his
wand toward the remnants of the fountain; the other statues sprang to
life too. The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and
sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest, before it dived at her, pin-
ning her to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin and the house-elf scuttled
toward the fireplaces set along the wall, and the one-armed centaur
galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool.
The headless statue thrust Harry backward, away from the fight, as
Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur can-
tered around them both.
“It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,” said Dumbledore
calmly. “The Aurors are on their way —”
“By which time I shall be gone, and you dead!” spat Voldemort. He
sent another Killing Curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting
the security guards desk, which burst into flame.
Dumbledore flicked his own wand. The force of the spell that em-
anated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his stone

813
CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed, and this time Voldemort
was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect
it. The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield,
though a deep, gonglike note reverberated from it, an oddly chilling
sound. . . .
“You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his
scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. “Above such brutality,
are you?”
“We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man,
Tom,” Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk toward Volde-
mort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had
happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall. “Merely taking your life
would not satisfy me, I admit —”
“There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!” snarled
Voldemort.
“You are quite wrong,” said Dumbledore, still closing in upon
Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the
matter over drinks. Harry felt scared to see him walking along, unde-
fended, shieldless. He wanted to cry out a warning, but his headless
guard kept shunting him backward toward the wall, blocking his
every attempt to get out from behind it. “Indeed, your failure to un-
derstand that there are things much worse than death has always been
your greatest weakness —”
Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This
time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore,
that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the
fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his
wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip. A long thin flame
flew from the tip; it wrapped itself around Voldemort, shield and all.
For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had won, but then the fiery
rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold upon Voldemort
at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.

814
THE ONLY ONE
HE EVER FEARED
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to
strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as
Voldemort reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the
pool where so recently the five statues had stood.
“Look out !” Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck —
Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak
wide, and swallowed the jet of green light whole. He burst into flame
and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled, and flightless. At the same mo-
ment, Dumbledore brandished his wand in one, long, fluid move-
ment — the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs
into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke;
the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of
molten glass —
For a few seconds Voldemort was visible only as a dark, rippling,
faceless figure, shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth, clearly
struggling to throw off the suffocating mass —
Then he was gone, and the water fell with a crash back into its
pool, slopping wildly over the sides, drenching the polished floor.
“MASTER!” screamed Bellatrix.
Sure it was over, sure Voldemort had decided to flee, Harry made to
run out from behind his statue guard, but Dumbledore bellowed,
“Stay where you are, Harry!”
For the first time, Dumbledore sounded frightened. Harry could
not see why. The hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing
Bellatrix still trapped under her statue, and the tiny baby Fawkes
croaking feebly on the floor —
And then Harry’s scar burst open. He knew he was dead: it was
pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance —
He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature

815
CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
with red eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his
body ended and the creature’s began. They were fused together,
bound by pain, and there was no escape —
And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his
agony he felt his jaw move. . . .
“Kill me now, Dumbledore. . . .”
Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry
felt the creature use him again. . . .
“If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy. . . .”
Let the pain stop, thought Harry. Let him kill us. . . . End it, Dumb-
ledore. . . . Death is nothing compared to this. . . .
And I’ll see Sirius again. . . .
And as Harry’s heart filled with emotion, the creature’s coils loos-
ened, the pain was gone, Harry was lying facedown on the floor, his
glasses gone, shivering as though he lay upon ice, not wood. . . .
And there were voices echoing through the hall, more voices than
there should have been: Harry opened his eyes, saw his glasses lying at
the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him, but which
now lay flat on its back, cracked and immobile. He put them on and
raised his head an inch to find Dumbledore’s crooked nose inches
from his own.
“Are you all right, Harry?”
“Yes,” said Harry, shaking so violently he could not hold his head
up properly. “Yeah, I’m — where’s Voldemort, where — who are all
these — what’s —”
The Atrium was full of people. The floor was reflecting emerald-
green flames that had burst into life in all the fireplaces along one wall,
and a stream of witches and wizards was emerging from them. As
Dumbledore pulled him back to his feet, Harry saw the tiny gold stat-
ues of the house-elf and the goblin leading a stunned-looking Cor-
nelius Fudge forward.
“He was there!” shouted a scarlet-robed man with a ponytail, who

816
THE ONLY ONE
HE EVER FEARED
was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall,
where Bellatrix had lain trapped moments before. “I saw him, Mr.
Fudge, I swear, it was You-Know-Who, he grabbed a woman and
Disapparated!”
“I know, Williamson, I know, I saw him too!” gibbered Fudge, who
was wearing pajamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as
though he had just run miles. “Merlin’s beard — here — here! — in
the Ministry of Magic! — great heavens above — it doesn’t seem pos-
sible — my word — how can this be?”
“If you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries, Cor-
nelius,” said Dumbledore, apparently satisfied that Harry was all
right, and walking forward so that the newcomers realized he was
there for the first time (a few of them raised their wands, others sim-
ply looked amazed; the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and
Fudge jumped so much that his slipper-clad feet left the floor), “you
will find several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death Cham-
ber, bound by an Anti-Disapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision
as to what to do with them.”
“Dumbledore!” gasped Fudge, apparently beside himself with
amazement. “You — here — I — I —”
He looked wildly around at the Aurors he had brought with him,
and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry,
“Seize him!”
“Cornelius, I am ready to fight your men — and win again!” said
Dumbledore in a thunderous voice. “But a few minutes ago you saw
proof, with your own eyes, that I have been telling you the truth for a
year. Lord Voldemort has returned, you have been chasing the wrong
men for twelve months, and it is time you listened to sense!”
“I — don’t — well —” blustered Fudge, looking around as though
hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do. When nobody
did, he said, “Very well — Dawlish! Williamson! Go down to the De-
partment of Mysteries and see . . . Dumbledore, you — you will need

817
CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
to tell me exactly — the Fountain of Magical Brethren — what hap-
pened?” he added in a kind of whimper, staring around at the floor,
where the remains of the statues of the witch, wizard, and centaur
now lay scattered.
“We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts,”
said Dumbledore.
“Harry — Harry Potter?”
Fudge spun around and stared at Harry, who was still standing
against the wall beside the fallen statue that had been guarding him
during Dumbledore and Voldemort’s duel.
“He-here?” said Fudge. “Why — what’s all this about?”
“I shall explain everything,” repeated Dumbledore, “when Harry is
back at school.”
He walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wiz-
ard’s head lay on the floor. He pointed his wand at it and muttered,
“Portus.” The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the
wooden floor for a few seconds, then became still once more.
“Now see here, Dumbledore!” said Fudge, as Dumbledore picked
up the head and walked back to Harry carrying it. “You haven’t got
authorization for that Portkey! You can’t do things like that right in
front of the Minister of Magic, you — you —”
His voice faltered as Dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over
his half-moon spectacles.
“You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hog-
warts,” said Dumbledore. “You will tell your Aurors to stop searching
for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he can return to
work. I will give you . . .” Dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve
hands from his pocket and glanced at it, “half an hour of my time
tonight, in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the im-
portant points of what has happened here. After that, I shall need to
return to my school. If you need more help from me you are, of

dressed to the headmaster will find me.”
Fudge goggled worse than ever. His mouth was open and his round
face grew pinker under his rumpled gray hair.
“I — you —”
Dumbledore turned his back on him.
“Take this Portkey, Harry.”
He held out the golden head of the statue, and Harry placed his
hand upon it, past caring what he did next or where he went.
“I shall see you in half an hour,” said Dumbledore quietly. “One
. . . two . . . three . . .”
Harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his
navel. The polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet; the
Atrium, Fudge, and Dumbledore had all disappeared, and he was fly-
ing forward in a whirlwind of color and sound. . . .

THE LOST PROPHECY
H
arry’s feet hit solid ground again; his knees buckled a little
and the golden wizard’s head fell with a resounding clunk to
the floor. He looked around and saw that he had arrived in Dumble-
dore’s office.
Everything seemed to have repaired itself during the headmaster’s
absence. The delicate silver instruments stood again upon the spindle-
legged tables, puffing and whirring serenely. The portraits of the
headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames, heads
lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of their pictures. Harry
looked through the window. There was a cool line of pale green along
the horizon: Dawn was approaching.
The silence and the stillness, broken only by the occasional grunt or
snuffle of a sleeping portrait, was unbearable to him. If his sur-
roundings could have reflected the feelings inside him, the pictures
would have been screaming in pain. He walked around the quiet,
beautiful office, breathing quickly, trying not to think. But he had to
think. . . . There was no escape. . . .
It was his fault Sirius had died; it was all his fault. If he, Harry, had

820
THE LOST PROPHECY
not been stupid enough to fall for Voldemort’s trick, if he had not
been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real, if he
had only opened his mind to the possibility that Voldemort was, as
Hermione had said, banking on Harry’s love of playing the hero . . .
It was unbearable, he would not think about it, he could not stand
it. . . . There was a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel
or examine, a dark hole where Sirius had been, where Sirius had van-
ished. He did not want to have to be alone with that great, silent
space, he could not stand it —
A picture behind him gave a particularly loud grunting snore, and
a cool voice said, “Ah . . . Harry Potter . . .”
Phineas Nigellus gave a long yawn, stretching his arms as he
watched Harry with shrewd, narrow eyes.
“And what brings you here in the early hours of the morning?” said
Phineas. “This office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful
headmaster. Or has Dumbledore sent you here? Oh, don’t tell me . . .”
He gave another shuddering yawn. “Another message for my worth-
less great-great-grandson?”
Harry could not speak. Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius
was dead, but Harry could not tell him. To say it aloud would be to
make it final, absolute, irretrievable.
A few more of the portraits had stirred now. Terror of being inter-
rogated made Harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob.
It would not turn. He was shut in.
“I hope this means,” said the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who
hung on the wall behind Dumbledore’s desk, “that Dumbledore will
soon be back with us?”
Harry turned. The wizard was eyeing him with great interest. Harry
nodded. He tugged again on the doorknob behind his back, but it
remained immovable.
“Oh good,” said the wizard. “It has been very dull without him,
very dull indeed.”

821
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
He settled himself on the thronelike chair on which he had been
painted and smiled benignly upon Harry.
“Dumbledore thinks very highly of you, as I am sure you know,” he
said comfortably. “Oh yes. Holds you in great esteem.”
The guilt filling the whole of Harry’s chest like some monstrous,
weighty parasite now writhed and squirmed. Harry could not stand
this, he could not stand being Harry anymore. . . . He had never felt
more trapped inside his own head and body, never wished so intensely
that he could be somebody — anybody — else. . . .
The empty fireplace burst into emerald-green flame, making Harry
leap away from the door, staring at the man spinning inside the grate.
As Dumbledore’s tall form unfolded itself from the fire, the wizards
and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake. Many of them
gave cries of welcome.
“Thank you,” said Dumbledore softly.
He did not look at Harry at first, but walked over to the perch be-
side the door and withdrew, from an inside pocket of his robes, the
tiny, ugly, featherless Fawkes, whom he placed gently on the tray of
soft ashes beneath the golden post where the full-grown Fawkes usu-
ally stood.
“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, finally turning away from the
baby bird, “you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow stu-
dents are going to suffer lasting damage from the night’s events.”
Harry tried to say “Good,” but no sound came out. It seemed to
him that Dumbledore was reminding him of the amount of damage
he had caused by his actions tonight, and although Dumbledore was
for once looking at him directly, and though his expression was kindly
rather than accusatory, Harry could not bear to meet his eyes.
“Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up now,” said Dumble-
dore. “Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St.
Mungo’s, but it seems that she will make a full recovery.”

822
THE LOST PROPHECY
Harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet, which was
growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler. He was sure that all the
portraits around the room were listening eagerly to every word Dum-
bledore spoke, wondering where Dumbledore and Harry had been
and why there had been injuries.
“I know how you are feeling, Harry,” said Dumbledore very
quietly.
“No, you don’t,” said Harry, and his voice was suddenly loud and
strong. White-hot anger leapt inside him. Dumbledore knew nothing
about his feelings.
“You see, Dumbledore?” said Phineas Nigellus slyly. “Never try to
understand the students. They hate it. They would much rather be
tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own —”
“That’s enough, Phineas,” said Dumbledore.
Harry turned his back on Dumbledore and stared determinedly
out of the opposite window. He could see the Quidditch stadium in
the distance. Sirius had appeared there once, disguised as the shaggy
black dog, so he could watch Harry play. . . . He had probably come
to see whether Harry was as good as James had been. . . . Harry had
never asked him. . . .
“There is no shame in what you are feeling, Harry,” said Dumble-
dore’s voice. “On the contrary . . . the fact that you can feel pain like
this is your greatest strength.”
Harry felt the white-hot anger lick his insides, blazing in the terri-
ble emptiness, filling him with the desire to hurt Dumbledore for his
calmness and his empty words.
“My greatest strength, is it?” said Harry, his voice shaking as he
stared out at the Quidditch stadium, no longer seeing it. “You haven’t
got a clue. . . . You don’t know . . .”
“What don’t I know?” asked Dumbledore calmly.
It was too much. Harry turned around, shaking with rage.

823
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
“I don’t want to talk about how I feel, all right?”
“Harry, suffering like this proves you are still a man! This pain is
part of being human —”
“THEN — I — DON’T — WANT — TO — BE — HUMAN!”
Harry roared, and he seized one of the delicate silver instruments from
the spindle-legged table beside him and flung it across the room. It
shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall. Several of the
pictures let out yells of anger and fright, and the portrait of Armando
Dippet said, “Really!”
“I DON’T CARE!” Harry yelled at them, snatching up a luna-
scope and throwing it into the fireplace. “I’VE HAD ENOUGH,
I’VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I
DON’T CARE ANYMORE —”
He seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and
threw that too. It broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in dif-
ferent directions.
“You do care,” said Dumbledore. He had not flinched or made a
single move to stop Harry demolishing his office. His expression was
calm, almost detached. “You care so much you feel as though you will
bleed to death with the pain of it.”
“I — DON’T!” Harry screamed, so loudly that he felt his throat
might tear, and for a second he wanted to rush at Dumbledore and
break him too; shatter that calm old face, shake him, hurt him, make
him feel some tiny part of the horror inside Harry.
“Oh yes, you do,” said Dumbledore, still more calmly. “You have
now lost your mother, your father, and the closest thing to a parent
you have ever known. Of course you care.”
“YOU DON’T KNOW HOW I FEEL!” Harry roared. “YOU —
STANDING THERE — YOU —”
But words were no longer enough, smashing things was no more
help. He wanted to run, he wanted to keep running and never look
back, he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes

824
THE LOST PROPHECY
staring at him, that hatefully calm old face. He ran to the door, seized
the doorknob again, and wrenched at it.
But the door would not open.
Harry turned back to Dumbledore.
“Let me out,” he said. He was shaking from head to foot.
“No,” said Dumbledore simply.
For a few seconds they stared at each other.
“Let me out,” Harry said again.
“No,” Dumbledore repeated.
“If you don’t — if you keep me in here — if you don’t let me —”
“By all means continue destroying my possessions,” said Dumble-
dore serenely. “I daresay I have too many.”
He walked around his desk and sat down behind it, watching
Harry.
“Let me out,” Harry said yet again, in a voice that was cold and al-
most as calm as Dumbledore’s.
“Not until I have had my say,” said Dumbledore.
“Do you — do you think I want to — do you think I give a — I
DON’T CARE WHAT YOU’VE GOT TO SAY!” Harry roared. “I
don’t want to hear anything you’ve got to say!”
“You will,” said Dumbledore sadly. “Because you are not nearly as
angry with me as you ought to be. If you are to attack me, as I know
you are close to doing, I would like to have thoroughly earned it.”
“What are you talking — ?”
“It is my fault that Sirius died,” said Dumbledore clearly. “Or I
should say almost entirely my fault — I will not be so arrogant as to
claim responsibility for the whole. Sirius was a brave, clever, and ener-
getic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hid-
ing while they believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should
never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you
to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight. If I had been open with
you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time

825
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of
Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there
tonight. And Sirius would not have had to come after you. That
blame lies with me, and with me alone.”
Harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but he was
unaware of it. He was gazing at Dumbledore, hardly breathing, lis-
tening yet barely understanding what he was hearing.
“Please sit down,” said Dumbledore. It was not an order, it was a
request.
Harry hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now littered
with silver cogs and fragments of wood and took the seat facing Dum-
bledore’s desk.
“Am I to understand,” said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harry’s
left, “that my great-great-grandson — the last of the Blacks — is
dead?”
“Yes, Phineas,” said Dumbledore.
“I don’t believe it,” said Phineas brusquely.
Harry turned his head in time to see Phineas marching out of his
portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in
Grimmauld Place. He would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait,
calling for Sirius through the house. . . .
“Harry, I owe you an explanation,” said Dumbledore. “An explana-
tion of an old man’s mistakes. For I see now that what I have done,
and not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of the fail-
ings of age. Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men
are guilty if they forget what it was to be young . . . and I seem to have
forgotten lately. . . .”
The sun was rising properly now. There was a rim of dazzling or-
ange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colorless and
bright. The light fell upon Dumbledore, upon the silver of his eye-
brows and beard, upon the lines gouged deeply into his face.
“I guessed, fifteen years ago,” said Dumbledore, “when I saw the

826
THE LOST PROPHECY
scar upon your forehead, what it might mean. I guessed that it might
be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort.”
“You’ve told me this before, Professor,” said Harry bluntly. He did
not care about being rude. He did not care about anything very much
anymore.
“Yes,” said Dumbledore apologetically. “Yes, but you see — it is
necessary to start with your scar. For it became apparent, shortly after
you rejoined the magical world, that I was correct, and that your scar
was giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you, or else
feeling powerful emotion.”
“I know,” said Harry wearily.
“And this ability of yours — to detect Voldemort’s presence, even
when he is disguised, and to know what he is feeling when his emo-
tions are roused — has become more and more pronounced since
Voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers.”
Harry did not bother to nod. He knew all of this already.
“More recently,” said Dumbledore, “I became concerned that
Voldemort might realize that this connection between you exists. Sure
enough, there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and
thoughts that he sensed your presence. I am speaking, of course, of the
night when you witnessed the attack on Mr. Weasley.”
“Yeah, Snape told me,” Harry muttered.
“Professor Snape, Harry,” Dumbledore corrected him quietly. “But
did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you? Why
I did not teach you Occlumency? Why I had not so much as looked
at you for months?”
Harry looked up. He could see now that Dumbledore looked sad
and tired.
“Yeah,” Harry mumbled. “Yeah, I wondered.”
“You see,” continued Dumbledore heavily “I believed it could not
be long before Voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind,
to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager to

827
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
give him more incentives to do so. I was sure that if he realized that
our relationship was — or had ever been — closer than that of head-
master and pupil, he would seize his chance to use you as a means to
spy on me. I feared the uses to which he would put you, the possibil-
ity that he might try and possess you. Harry, I believe I was right to
think that Voldemort would have made use of you in such a way. On
those rare occasions when we had close contact, I thought I saw a
shadow of him stir behind your eyes. . . . I was trying, in distancing
myself from you, to protect you. An old man’s mistake . . .”
Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in
him, ready to strike, on those occasions when he and Dumbledore
made eye contact.
“Voldemort’s aim in possessing you, as he demonstrated tonight,
would not have been my destruction. It would have been yours. He
hoped, when he possessed you briefly a short while ago, that I would
sacrifice you in the hope of killing him.”
He sighed deeply. Harry was letting the words wash over him. He
would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago, and
now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that
was the loss of Sirius, none of it mattered . . .
“Sirius told me that you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very
night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley’s attack. I knew at
once that my worst fears were correct: Voldemort from that point had
realized he could use you. In an attempt to arm you against Volde-
mort’s assaults on your mind, I arranged Occlumency lessons with
Professor Snape.”
He paused. Harry watched the sunlight, which was sliding slowly
across the polished surface of Dumbledore’s desk, illuminate a silver
ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill. Harry could tell that the por-
traits all around them were awake and listening raptly to Dumble-
dore’s explanation. He could hear the occasional rustle of robes, the
slight clearing of a throat. Phineas Nigellus had still not returned. . . .

828
THE LOST PROPHECY
“Professor Snape discovered,” Dumbledore resumed, “that you had
been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for
months. Voldemort, of course, had been obsessed with the possibility of
hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body, and as he dwelled
on the door, so did you, though you did not know what it meant.
“And then you saw Rookwood, who worked in the Department of
Mysteries before his arrest, telling Voldemort what we had known all
along — that the prophecies held in the Ministry of Magic are heavily
protected. Only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the
shelves without suffering madness. In this case, either Voldemort him-
self would have to enter the Ministry of Magic and risk revealing
himself at last — or else you would have to take it for him. It became
a matter of even greater urgency that you should master Occlumency.”
“But I didn’t,” muttered Harry. He said it aloud to try and ease the
dead weight of guilt inside him; a confession must surely relieve some
of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart. “I didn’t practice, I didn’t
bother, I could’ve stopped myself having those dreams, Hermione
kept telling me to do it, if I had he’d never have been able to show me
where to go, and — Sirius wouldn’t — Sirius wouldn’t —”
Something was erupting inside Harry’s head: a need to justify him-
self, to explain —
“I tried to check he’d really taken Sirius, I went to Umbridge’s of-
fice, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire, and he said Sirius wasn’t there, he
said he’d gone!”
“Kreacher lied,” said Dumbledore calmly. “You are not his master,
he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself. Kreacher
intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic.”
“He — he sent me on purpose?”
“Oh yes. Kreacher, I am afraid, has been serving more than one
master for months.”
“How?” said Harry blankly. “He hasn’t been out of Grimmauld
Place for years.”

829
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
“Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas,” said
Dumbledore, “when Sirius, apparently, shouted at him to ‘get out.’
He took Sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the
house. He went to the only Black family member for whom he had
any respect left. . . . Black’s cousin Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife
of Lucius Malfoy.”
“How do you know all this?” Harry said. His heart was beating very
fast. He felt sick. He remembered worrying about Kreacher’s odd
absence over Christmas, remembered him turning up again in the
attic. . . .
“Kreacher told me last night,” said Dumbledore. “You see, when
you gave Professor Snape that cryptic warning, he realized that you
had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of
Mysteries. He, like you, attempted to contact Sirius at once. I should
explain that members of the Order of the Phoenix have more reliable
methods of communicating than the fire in Dolores Umbridge’s of-
fice. Professor Snape found that Sirius was alive and safe in Grim-
mauld Place.
“When, however, you did not return from your trip into the forest
with Dolores Umbridge, Professor Snape grew worried that you still
believed Sirius to be a captive of Lord Voldemort’s. He alerted certain
Order members at once.”
Dumbledore heaved a great sigh and then said, “Alastor Moody,
Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Remus Lupin were at
headquarters when he made contact. All agreed to go to your aid at
once. Professor Snape requested that Sirius remain behind, as he
needed somebody to remain at headquarters to tell me what had hap-
pened, for I was due there at any moment. In the meantime he, Pro-
fessor Snape, intended to search the forest for you.
“But Sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to
search for you. He delegated to Kreacher the task of telling me what
had happened. And so it was that when I arrived in Grimmauld Place

830
THE LOST PROPHECY
shortly after they had all left for the Ministry, it was the elf who told
me — laughing fit to burst — where Sirius had gone.”
“He was laughing?” said Harry in a hollow voice.
“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore. “You see, Kreacher was not able to be-
tray us totally. He is not Secret-Keeper for the Order, he could not
give the Malfoys our whereabouts or tell them any of the Order’s con-
fidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal. He was bound by
the enchantments of his kind, which is to say that he could not dis-
obey a direct order from his master, Sirius. But he gave Narcissa
information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort, yet must
have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from
repeating it.”
“Like what?” said Harry.
“Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world
was you,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Like the fact that you were com-
ing to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother. Voldemort
knew already, of course, that Sirius was in the Order, that you knew
where he was — but Kreacher’s information made him realize that the
one person whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius
Black.”
Harry’s lips were cold and numb.
“So . . . when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night . . .”
“The Malfoys — undoubtedly on Voldemort’s instructions — had
told him he must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you
had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured. Then, if you decided to
check whether Sirius was at home or not, Kreacher would be able to
pretend he was not. Kreacher injured Buckbeak the hippogriff yester-
day, and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire,
Sirius was upstairs trying to tend to him.”
There seemed to be very little air in Harry’s lungs, his breathing was
quick and shallow.
“And Kreacher told you all this . . . and laughed?” he croaked.

831
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
“He did not wish to tell me,” said Dumbledore. “But I am a suffi-
ciently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied
to and I — persuaded him — to tell me the full story, before I left for
the Department of Mysteries.”
“And,” whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees,
“and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him —”
“She was quite right, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I warned Sirius
when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our headquarters that
Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect. I also told him
that Kreacher could be dangerous to us. I do not think that Sirius
took me very seriously, or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with
feelings as acute as a humans —”
“Don’t you blame — don’t you — talk — about Sirius like —”
Harry’s breath was constricted, he could not get the words out prop-
erly. But the rage that had subsided so briefly had flared in him again;
he would not let Dumbledore criticize Sirius. “Kreacher’s a lying —
foul — he deserved —”
“Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry,” said Dum-
bledore. “Yes, he is to be pitied. His existence has been as miserable as
your friend Dobby’s. He was forced to do Sirius’s bidding, because Sir-
ius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved, but he felt no
true loyalty to him. And whatever Kreacher’s faults, it must be admit-
ted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher’s lot easier —”
“DON’T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT!” Harry yelled.
He was on his feet again, furious, ready to fly at Dumbledore, who
had plainly not understood Sirius at all, how brave he was, how much
he had suffered . . .
“What about Snape?” Harry spat. “You’re not talking about him,
are you? When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me
as usual —”
“Harry, you know that Professor Snape had no choice but to pre-
tend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge,” said

832
THE LOST PROPHECY
Dumbledore steadily, “but as I have explained, he informed the Order
as soon as possible about what you had said. It was he who deduced
where you had gone when you did not return from the forest. It was
he too who gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was
attempting to force you to tell of Sirius’s whereabouts. . . .”
Harry disregarded this; he felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape,
it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt, and he wanted
to hear Dumbledore agree with him.
“Snape — Snape g-goaded Sirius about staying in the house — he
made out Sirius was a coward —”
“Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble
taunts to hurt him,” said Dumbledore.
“Snape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons!” Harry snarled.
“He threw me out of his office!”
“I am aware of it,” said Dumbledore heavily. “I have already said
that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was
sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than
to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my
presence —”
“Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with
him —” Harry remembered Ron’s thoughts on the subject and
plunged on. “How do you know he wasn’t trying to soften me up for
Voldemort, make it easier for him to get inside my —”
“I trust Severus Snape,” said Dumbledore simply. “But I forgot —
another old man’s mistake — that some wounds run too deep for the
healing. I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about
your father — I was wrong.”
“But that’s okay, is it?” yelled Harry, ignoring the scandalized faces
and disapproving mutterings of the portraits covering the walls. “It’s
okay for Snape to hate my dad, but it’s not okay for Sirius to hate
Kreacher?”
“Sirius did not hate Kreacher,” said Dumbledore. “He regarded

833
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference
and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike. . . .
The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mis-
treated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping
our reward.”
“SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID HE?” Harry
yelled.
“I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it,” Dumbledore
replied quietly. “Sirius was not a cruel man, he was kind to house-elves
in general. He had no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living
reminder of the home Sirius had hated.”
“Yeah, he did hate it!” said Harry, his voice cracking, turning his
back on Dumbledore and walking away. The sun was bright inside the
room now, and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked,
without realizing what he was doing, without seeing the office at all.
“You made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it, that’s why
he wanted to get out last night —”
“I was trying to keep Sirius alive,” said Dumbledore quietly.
“People don’t like being locked up!” Harry said furiously, rounding
on him. “You did it to me all last summer —”
Dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his long-fingered
hands. Harry watched him, but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaus-
tion, or sadness, or whatever it was from Dumbledore, did not soften
him. On the contrary, he felt even angrier that Dumbledore was
showing signs of weakness. He had no business being weak when
Harry wanted to rage and storm at him.
Dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his
half-moon glasses.
“It is time,” he said, “for me to tell you what I should have told you
five years ago, Harry. Please sit down. I am going to tell you every-
thing. I ask only a little patience. You will have your chance to rage at

834
THE LOST PROPHECY
me — to do whatever you like — when I have finished. I will not stop
you.”
Harry glared at him for a moment, then flung himself back into the
chair opposite Dumbledore and waited. Dumbledore stared for a mo-
ment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at
Harry and said, “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe
and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well — not quite whole.
You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and
uncle’s doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and diffi-
cult years.”
He paused. Harry said nothing.
“You might ask — and with good reason — why it had to be so.
Why could some Wizarding family not have taken you in? Many
would have done so more than gladly, would have been honored and
delighted to raise you as a son.
“My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in
more danger than perhaps anyone but myself realized. Voldemort had
been vanquished hours before, but his supporters — and many of
them are almost as terrible as he — were still at large, angry, desper-
ate, and violent. And I had to make my decision too with regard to the
years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone forever? No. I
knew not whether it would be ten, twenty, or fifty years before he re-
turned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure too, knowing
him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you.
“I knew that Voldemort’s knowledge of magic is perhaps more ex-
tensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and
powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if
he ever returned to full power.
“But I knew too where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my
decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which
he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore,

835
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
underestimated — to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact
that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection
he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I
put my trust, therefore, in your mother’s blood. I delivered you to her
sister, her only remaining relative.”
“She doesn’t love me,” said Harry at once. “She doesn’t give a
damn —”
“But she took you,” Dumbledore cut across him. “She may have
taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took
you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your
mother’s sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could
give you.”
“I still don’t —”
“While you can still call home the place where your mother’s blood
dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He
shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became
your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you
can still call it home, there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this.
I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her
doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept
you alive for the past fifteen years.”
“Wait,” said Harry. “Wait a moment.”
He sat up straighter in his chair, staring at Dumbledore.
“You sent that Howler. You told her to remember — it was your
voice —”
“I thought,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head slightly, “that she
might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you. I sus-
pected the dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of
having you as a surrogate son.”
“It did,” said Harry quietly. “Well — my uncle more than her. He
wanted to chuck me out, but after the Howler came she — she said I

836
THE LOST PROPHECY
had to stay.” He stared at the floor for a moment, then said, “But
what’s this got to do with . . .”
He could not say Sirius’s name.
“Five years ago, then,” continued Dumbledore, as though he had
not paused in his story, “you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy
nor as well nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and
healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as
I could have hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was
working well.
“And then . . . well, you will remember the events of your first year
at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do. You rose magnificently to the
challenge that faced you, and sooner — much sooner — than I had
anticipated, you found yourself face-to-face with Voldemort. You sur-
vived again. You did more. You delayed his return to full power and
strength. You fought a man’s fight. I was . . . prouder of you than I can
say.
“Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine,” said Dumb-
ledore. “An obvious flaw that I knew, even then, might be the undo-
ing of it all. And yet, knowing how important it was that my plan
should succeed, I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin
it. I alone could prevent this, so I alone must be strong. And here was
my first test, as you lay in the hospital wing, weak from your struggle
with Voldemort.”
“I don’t understand what you’re saying,” said Harry.
“Don’t you remember asking me, as you lay in the hospital wing,
why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby?”
Harry nodded.
“Ought I to have told you then?”
Harry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing, but his heart was
racing again.
“You do not see the flaw in the plan yet? No . . . perhaps not. Well,

837
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
as you know, I decided not to answer you. Eleven, I told myself,
was much too young to know. I had never intended to tell you when
you were eleven. The knowledge would be too much at such a young
age.
“I should have recognized the danger signs then. I should have
asked myself why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already
asked me the question to which I knew, one day, I must give a terrible
answer. I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I
did not have to do it on that particular day. . . . You were too young,
much too young.
“And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts. And once again
you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced. Once again
you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams. You did not ask me
again, however, why Voldemort had left that mark upon you. We dis-
cussed your scar, oh yes. . . . We came very, very close to the subject.
Why did I not tell you everything?
“Well, it seemed to me that twelve was, after all, hardly better than
eleven to receive such information. I allowed you to leave my pres-
ence, bloodstained, exhausted but exhilarated, and if I felt a twinge of
unease that I ought, perhaps, have told you then, it was swiftly si-
lenced. You were still so young, you see, and I could not find it in me
to spoil that night of triumph. . . .
“Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now?
I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could
avoid, that I must avoid.”
“I don’t —”
“I cared about you too much,” said Dumbledore simply. “I cared
more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your
peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that
might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as
Voldemort expects we fools who love to act.
“Is there a defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have —

838
THE LOST PROPHECY
and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined —
not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered.
What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and crea-
tures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you
were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have
such a person on my hands.
“We entered your third year. I watched from afar as you struggled
to repel dementors, as you found Sirius, learned what he was and res-
cued him. Was I to tell you then, at the moment when you had tri-
umphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the Ministry?
But now, at the age of thirteen, my excuses were running out. Young
you might be, but you had proved you were exceptional. My con-
science was uneasy, Harry. I knew the time must come soon. . . .
“But you came out of the maze last year, having watched Cedric
Diggory die, having escaped death so narrowly yourself . . . and I did
not tell you, though I knew, now Voldemort had returned, I must do
it soon. And now, tonight, I know you have long been ready for the
knowledge I have kept from you for so long, because you have proved
that I should have placed the burden upon you before this. My only
defense is this: I have watched you struggling under more burdens
than any student who has ever passed through this school, and I could
not bring myself to add another — the greatest one of all.”
Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak.
“I still don’t understand.”
“Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a
prophecy made shortly before your birth. He knew the prophecy had
been made, though he did not know its full contents. He set out to
kill you when you were still a baby, believing he was fulfilling the
terms of the prophecy. He discovered, to his cost, that he was mis-
taken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired. And so, since his
return to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary escape
from him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in

839
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
its entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously
since his return: the knowledge of how to destroy you.”
The sun had risen fully now. Dumbledore’s office was bathed in it.
The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided
gleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry
had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the
baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes.
“The prophecy’s smashed,” Harry said blankly. “I was pulling
Neville up those benches in the — the room where the archway was,
and I ripped his robes and it fell. . . .”
“The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy
kept by the Department of Mysteries. But the prophecy was made to
somebody, and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly.”
“Who heard it?” asked Harry, though he thought he knew the an-
swer already.
“I did,” said Dumbledore. “On a cold, wet night sixteen years ago,
in a room above the bar at the Hog’s Head Inn. I had gone there to see
an applicant for the post of Divination teacher, though it was against
my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all.
The applicant, however, was the great-great-granddaughter of a very
famous, very gifted Seer, and I thought it common politeness to meet
her. I was disappointed. It seemed to me that she had not a trace of the
gift herself. I told her, courteously I hope, that I did not think she
would be suitable for the post. I turned to leave.”
Dumbledore got to his feet and walked past Harry to the black cab-
inet that stood beside Fawkes’s perch. He bent down, slid back a
catch, and took from inside it the shallow stone basin, carved with
runes around the edges, in which Harry had seen his father torment-
ing Snape. Dumbledore walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve
upon it, and raised his wand to his own temple. From it, he withdrew
silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand, and
deposited them in the basin. He sat back down behind his desk and

840
THE LOST PROPHECY
watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment.
Then, with a sigh, he raised his wand and prodded the silvery sub-
stance with its tip.
A figure rose out of it, draped in shawls, her eyes magnified to enor-
mous size behind her glasses, and she revolved slowly, her feet in the
basin. But when Sibyll Trelawney spoke, it was not in her usual ethe-
real, mystic voice, but in the harsh, hoarse tones Harry had heard her
use once before.
“THE ONE WITH THE POWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD AP-
PROACHES. . . . BORN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THRICE DEFIED HIM, BORN
AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES . . . AND THE DARK LORD WILL MARK
HIM AS HIS EQUAL, BUT HE WILL HAVE POWER THE DARK LORD KNOWS
NOT . . . AND EITHER MUST DIE AT THE HAND OF THE OTHER FOR NEI-
THER CAN LIVE WHILE THE OTHER SURVIVES . . . . THE ONE WITH THE
POWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD WILL BE BORN AS THE SEVENTH
MONTH DIES . . . .”
The slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver
mass below and vanished.
The silence within the office was absolute. Neither Dumbledore
nor Harry nor any of the portraits made a sound. Even Fawkes had
fallen silent.
“Professor Dumbledore?” Harry said very quietly, for Dumbledore,
still staring at the Pensieve, seemed completely lost in thought. “It . . .
did that mean . . . What did that mean?”
“It meant,” said Dumbledore, “that the person who has the only
chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end
of July, nearly sixteen years ago. This boy would be born to parents
who had already defied Voldemort three times.”
Harry felt as though something was closing in upon him. His
breathing seemed difficult again.
“It means — me?”
Dumbledore surveyed him for a moment through his glasses.

841
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
“The odd thing is, Harry,” he said softly, “that it may not have
meant you at all. Sibyll’s prophecy could have applied to two wizard
boys, both born at the end of July that year, both of whom had par-
ents in the Order of the Phoenix, both sets of parents having narrowly
escaped Voldemort three times. One, of course, was you. The other
was Neville Longbottom.”
“But then . . . but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and
not Neville’s?”
“The official record was relabeled after Voldemort’s attack on you
as a child,” said Dumbledore. “It seemed plain to the keeper of the
Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you be-
cause he knew you to be the one to whom Sibyll was referring.”
“Then — it might not be me?” said Harry.
“I am afraid,” said Dumbledore slowly, looking as though every
word cost him a great effort, “that there is no doubt that it is you.”
“But you said — Neville was born at the end of July too — and his
mum and dad —”
“You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identi-
fying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort. . . . Volde-
mort himself would ‘mark him as his equal.’ And so he did, Harry. He
chose you, not Neville. He gave you the scar that has proved both
blessing and curse.”
“But he might have chosen wrong!” said Harry. “He might have
marked the wrong person!”
“He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,”
said Dumbledore. “And notice this, Harry. He chose, not the pureblood
(which, according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being
or knowing), but the half-blood, like himself. He saw himself in you be-
fore he had ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not
kill you, as he intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have
fitted you to escape him not once, but four times so far — something
that neither your parents, nor Neville’s parents, ever achieved.”

842
THE LOST PROPHECY
“Why did he do it, then?” said Harry, who felt numb and cold.
“Why did he try and kill me as a baby? He should have waited to see
whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were older and
tried to kill whoever it was then —”
“That might, indeed, have been the more practical course,” said
Dumbledore, “except that Voldemort’s information about the
prophecy was incomplete. The Hog’s Head Inn, which Sibyll chose
for its cheapness, has long attracted, shall we say, a more interesting
clientele than the Three Broomsticks. As you and your friends found
out to your cost, and I to mine that night, it is a place where it is never
safe to assume you are not being overheard. Of course, I had not
dreamed, when I set out to meet Sibyll Trelawney, that I would hear
anything worth overhearing. My — our — one stroke of good for-
tune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the
prophecy and thrown from the building.”
“So he only heard . . . ?”
“He heard only the first part, the part foretelling the birth of a boy
in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort. Consequently, he
could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk trans-
ferring power to you — again marking you as his equal. So Voldemort
never knew that there might be danger in attacking you, that it might
be wise to wait or to learn more. He did not know that you would
have ‘power the Dark Lord knows not’ —”
“But I don’t!” said Harry in a strangled voice. “I haven’t any powers
he hasn’t got, I couldn’t fight the way he did tonight, I can’t possess
people or — or kill them —”
“There is a room in the Department of Mysteries,” interrupted
Dumbledore, “that is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that
is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human
intelligence, than forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most myste-
rious of the many subjects for study that reside there. It is the power
held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which

843
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
Voldemort has not at all. That power took you to save Sirius tonight.
That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he
could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the
end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your
heart that saved you.”
Harry closed his eyes. If he had not gone to save Sirius, Sirius
would not have died. . . . More to stave off the moment when he
would have to think of Sirius again, Harry asked, without caring
much about the answer, “The end of the prophecy . . . it was some-
thing about . . . ‘neither can live. . . .’ ”
“ ‘. . . while the other survives,’ ” said Dumbledore.
“So,” said Harry, dredging up the words from what felt like a deep
well of despair inside him, “so does that mean that . . . that one of us
has got to kill the other one . . . in the end?”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore.
For a long time, neither of them spoke. Somewhere far beyond the
office walls, Harry could hear the sound of voices, students heading
down to the Great Hall for an early breakfast, perhaps. It seemed im-
possible that there could be people in the world who still desired food,
who laughed, who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone
forever. Sirius seemed a million miles away already, even if a part of
Harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil, he would
have found Sirius looking back at him, greeting him, perhaps, with
his laugh like a bark. . . .
“I feel I owe you another explanation, Harry,” said Dumbledore
hesitantly. “You may, perhaps, have wondered why I never chose you
as a prefect? I must confess . . . that I rather thought . . . you had
enough responsibility to be going on with.”
Harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down Dumble-
dore’s face into his long silver beard.

HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED RETURNS
In a brief statement Friday night, Minister of Magic
Cornelius Fudge confirmed that He-Who-Must-
Not-Be Named has returned to this country and is
active once more.
“It is with great regret that I must confirm that the
wizard styling himself Lord — well, you know who I
mean — is alive and among us again,” said Fudge,
looking tired and flustered as he addressed reporters.
“It is with almost equal regret that we report the mass
revolt of the dementors of Azkaban, who have shown
themselves averse to continuing in the Ministry’s em-
ploy. We believe that the dementors are currently tak-
ing direction from Lord — Thingy.
“We urge the magical population to remain vigi-
lant. The Ministry is currently publishing guides to
elementary home and personal defense that will be

845
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
delivered free to all Wizarding homes within the
coming month.”
The Minister’s statement was met with dismay and
alarm from the Wizarding community, which as re-
cently as last Wednesday was receiving Ministry as-
surances that there was “no truth whatsoever in these
persistent rumors that You-Know-Who is operating
amongst us once more.”
Details of the events that led to the Ministry turn-
around are still hazy, though it is believed that He-
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and a select band of
followers (known as Death Eaters) gained entry to
the Ministry of Magic itself on Thursday evening.
Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated headmaster
of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, re-
instated member of the International Confederation
of Wizards, and reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wiz-
engamot, was unavailable for comment last night. He
has insisted for a year that You-Know-Who was not
dead, as was widely hoped and believed, but recruit-
ing followers once more for a fresh attempt to seize
power. Meanwhile the Boy Who Lived —
“There you are, Harry, I knew they’d drag you into it somehow,”
said Hermione, looking over the top of the paper at him.
They were in the hospital wing. Harry was sitting on the end of
Ron’s bed and they were both listening to Hermione read the front
page of the Sunday Prophet. Ginny, whose ankle had been mended in
a trice by Madam Pomfrey, was curled up at the foot of Hermione’s
bed; Neville, whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size
and shape, was in a chair between the two beds; and Luna, who had
dropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of The Quibbler, was

846
THE SECOND
WAR BEGINS
reading the magazine upside down and apparently not taking in a
word Hermione was saying.
“He’s ‘the Boy Who Lived’ again now, though, isn’t he?” said Ron
darkly. “Not such a show-off maniac anymore, eh?”
He helped himself to a handful of Chocolate Frogs from the im-
mense pile on his bedside cabinet, threw a few to Harry, Ginny, and
Neville, and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth. There
were still deep welts on his forearms where the brain’s tentacles had
wrapped around him. According to Madam Pomfrey, thoughts could
leave deeper scarring than almost anything else, though since she had
started applying copious amounts of Dr. Ubbly’s Oblivious Unc-
tion, there seemed to be some improvement.
“Yes, they’re very complimentary about you now, Harry,” said
Hermione, now scanning down the article. “ ‘A lone voice of truth . . .
perceived as unbalanced, yet never wavered in his story . . . forced to bear
ridicule and slander . . .’ Hmmm,” said Hermione, frowning, “I notice
they don’t mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing
and slandering, though. . . .”
She winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs. The curse Dolohov
had used on her, though less effective than it would have been had he
been able to say the incantation aloud, had nevertheless caused, in
Madam Pomfrey’s words, “quite enough damage to be going on with.”
Hermione was having to take ten different types of potion every day
and although she was improving greatly, was already bored with the
hospital wing.
“ ‘You-Know-Who’s Last Attempt to Take Over, pages two to four, What
the Ministry Should Have Told Us, page five, Why Nobody Listened to Al-
bus Dumbledore, pages six to eight, Exclusive Interview with Harry Pot-
ter, page nine . . .’ Well,” said Hermione, folding up the newspaper
and throwing it aside, “it’s certainly given them lots to write about.
And that interview with Harry isn’t exclusive, it’s the one that was in
The Quibbler months ago. . . .”

847
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
“Daddy sold it to them,” said Luna vaguely, turning a page of The
Quibbler. “He got a very good price for it too, so we’re going to go on
an expedition to Sweden this summer and see if we can catch a
Crumple-Horned Snorkack.”
Hermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment, then said,
“That sounds lovely.”
Ginny caught Harry’s eye and looked away quickly, grinning.
“So anyway,” said Hermione, sitting up a little straighter and winc-
ing again, “what’s going on in school?”
“Well, Flitwick’s got rid of Fred and George’s swamp,” said Ginny.
“He did it in about three seconds. But he left a tiny patch under the
window and he’s roped it off —”
“Why?” said Hermione, looking startled.
“Oh, he just says it was a really good bit of magic,” said Ginny,
shrugging.
“I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George,” said Ron
through a mouthful of chocolate. “They sent me all these, you know,”
he told Harry, pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside him.
“Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?”
Hermione looked rather disapproving and asked, “So has all the
trouble stopped now Dumbledore’s back?”
“Yes,” said Neville, “everything’s settled right back down again.”
“I s’pose Filch is happy, is he?” asked Ron, propping a Chocolate
Frog card featuring Dumbledore against his water jug.
“Not at all,” said Ginny. “He’s really, really miserable, actually. . . .”
She lowered her voice to a whisper. “He keeps saying Umbridge was
the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts. . . .”
All six of them looked around. Professor Umbridge was lying in a
bed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode
alone into the forest to rescue her from the centaurs. How he had
done it — how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor
Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him — nobody knew, and

848
THE SECOND
WAR BEGINS
Umbridge was certainly not telling. Since she had returned to the cas-
tle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. No-
body really knew what was wrong with her either. Her usually neat
mousy hair was very untidy and there were bits of twig and leaf in it,
but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed.
“Madam Pomfrey says she’s just in shock,” whispered Hermione.
“Sulking, more like,” said Ginny
“Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,” said Ron, and with his
tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises. Umbridge sat bolt upright,
looking wildly around.
“Anything wrong, Professor?” called Madam Pomfrey, poking her
head around her office door.
“No . . . no . . .” said Umbridge, sinking back into her pillows,
“no, I must have been dreaming. . . .”
Hermione and Ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes.
“Speaking of centaurs,” said Hermione, when she had recovered a
little, “who’s Divination teacher now? Is Firenze staying?”
“He’s got to,” said Harry, “the other centaurs won’t take him back,
will they?”
“It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach,” said
Ginny.
“Bet Dumbledore wishes he could’ve got rid of Trelawney for
good,” said Ron, now munching on his fourteenth Frog. “Mind you,
the whole subjects useless if you ask me, Firenze isn’t a lot better. . . .”
“How can you say that?” Hermione demanded. “After we’ve just
found out that there are real prophecies?”
Harry’s heart began to race. He had not told Ron, Hermione, or
anyone else what the prophecy had contained. Neville had told them
it had smashed while Harry was pulling him up the steps in the Death
Room, and Harry had not yet corrected this impression. He was not
ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be ei-
ther murderer or victim, there was no other way. . . .

849
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
“It is a pity it broke,” said Hermione quietly, shaking her head.
“Yeah, it is,” said Ron. “Still, at least You-Know-Who never found
out what was in it either — where are you going?” he added, looking
both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up.
“Er — Hagrid’s,” said Harry. “You know, he just got back and I
promised I’d go down and see him and tell him how you two are. . . .”
“Oh all right then,” said Ron grumpily, looking out of the dormi-
tory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond. “Wish we could
come . . .”
“Say hello to him for us!” called Hermione, as Harry proceeded
down the ward. “And ask him what’s happening about . . . about his
little friend!”
Harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and under-
stood as he left the dormitory.
The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday. Everybody was
clearly out in the sunny grounds, enjoying the end of their exams and
the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by studying or
homework. Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor, peering
out of windows as he went. He could see people messing around in
the air over the Quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming
in the lake, accompanied by the giant squid.
He was finding it hard at the moment to decide whether he wanted
to be with people or not. Whenever he was in company he wanted to
get away, and whenever he was alone he wanted company. He thought
he might really go and visit Hagrid, though; he had not talked to him
properly since he had returned. . . .
Harry had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall
when Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle emerged from a door on the right
that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room. Harry
stopped dead; so did Malfoy and the others. For a few moments, the
only sounds were the shouts, laughter, and splashes drifting into the
hall from the grounds through the open front doors.

850
THE SECOND
WAR BEGINS
Malfoy glanced around. Harry knew he was checking for signs of
teachers. Then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice,
“You’re dead, Potter.”
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Funny,” he said, “you’d think I’d have
stopped walking around. . . .”
Malfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him. He felt a kind
of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale, pointed face contorted
with rage.
“You’re going to pay,” said Malfoy in a voice barely louder than a
whisper. “I’m going to make you pay for what you’ve done to my
father. . . .”
“Well, I’m terrified now,” said Harry sarcastically. “I s’pose Lord
Voldemort’s just a warm-up act compared to you three — what’s the
matter?” he said, for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had all looked
stricken at the sound of the name. “He’s your dad’s mate, isn’t he? Not
scared of him, are you?”
“You think you’re such a big man, Potter,” said Malfoy, advancing
now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him. “You wait. I’ll have you. You
can’t land my father in prison —”
“I thought I just had,” said Harry.
“The dementors have left Azkaban,” said Malfoy quietly. “Dad and
the others’ll be out in no time. . . .”
“Yeah, I expect they will,” said Harry. “Still, at least everyone
knows what scumbags they are now —”
Malfoy’s hand flew toward his wand, but Harry was too quick for
him. He had drawn his own wand before Malfoy’s fingers had even
entered the pocket of his robes.
“Potter!”
The voice rang across the entrance hall; Snape had emerged from the
staircase leading down to his office, and at the sight of him Harry felt a
great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt toward Malfoy. . . . What-
ever Dumbledore said, he would never forgive Snape . . . never . . .

851
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
“What are you doing, Potter?” said Snape coldly as ever, as he
strode over to the four of them.
“I’m trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,” said Harry
fiercely.
Snape stared at him.
“Put that wand away at once,” he said curtly. “Ten points from
Gryff —”
Snape looked toward the giant hourglasses on the walls and gave a
sneering smile.
“Ah. I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hour-
glass to take away. In that case, Potter, we will simply have to —”
“Add some more?”
Professor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone steps into the
castle. She was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning
heavily on a walking stick with her other, but otherwise looked quite
well.
“Professor McGonagall!” said Snape, striding forward. “Out of St.
Mungo’s, I see!”
“Yes, Professor Snape,” said Professor McGonagall, shrugging off
her traveling cloak, “I’m quite as good as new. You two — Crabbe —
Goyle —”
She beckoned them forward imperiously and they came, shuffling
their large feet and looking awkward.
“Here,” said Professor McGonagall, thrusting her carpetbag into
Crabbe’s chest and her cloak into Goyle’s, “take these up to my office
for me.”
They turned and stumped away up the marble staircase.
“Right then,” said Professor McGonagall, looking up at the hour-
glasses on the wall, “well, I think Potter and his friends ought to have
fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of You-Know-
Who! What say you, Professor Snape?”

852
THE SECOND
WAR BEGINS
“What?” snapped Snape, though Harry knew he had heard per-
fectly well. “Oh — well — I suppose . . .”
“So that’s fifty each for Potter, the two Weasleys, Longbottom, and
Miss Granger,” said Professor McGonagall, and a shower of rubies fell
down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor’s hourglass as she spoke.
“Oh — and fifty for Miss Lovegood, I suppose,” she added, and a
number of sapphires fell into Ravenclaw’s glass. “Now, you wanted to
take ten from Mr. Potter, I think, Professor Snape — so there we
are. . . .”
A few rubies retreated into the upper bulb, leaving a respectable
amount below nevertheless.
“Well, Potter, Malfoy, I think you ought to be outside on a glorious
day like this,” Professor McGonagall continued briskly.
Harry did not need telling twice. He thrust his wand back inside
his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another
glance at Snape and Malfoy.
The hot sun hit him with a blast as he walked across the lawns
toward Hagrid’s cabin. Students lying around on the grass sun-
bathing, talking, reading the Sunday Prophet, and eating sweets
looked up at him as he passed. Some called out to him, or else
waved, clearly eager to show that they, like the Prophet, had decided
he was something of a hero. Harry said nothing to any of them. He
had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days
ago, but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred it
that way.
He thought at first when he knocked on Hagrid’s cabin door that
he was out, but then Fang came charging around the corner and al-
most bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome. Hagrid, it
transpired, was picking runner beans in his back garden.
“All righ’, Harry!” he said, beaming, when Harry approached the
fence. “Come in, come in, we’ll have a cup o’ dandelion juice. . . .

853
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
“How’s things?” Hagrid asked him, as they settled down at his
wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice. “You — er — feelin’ all
righ’, are yeh?”
Harry knew from the look of concern on Hagrid’s face that he was
not referring to Harry’s physical well-being.
“I’m fine,” Harry said quickly, because he could not bear to discuss
the thing that he knew was in Hagrid’s mind. “So, where’ve you
been?”
“Bin hidin’ out in the mountains,” said Hagrid. “Up in a cave, like
Sirius did when he —”
Hagrid broke off, cleared his throat gruffly, looked at Harry, and
took a long draft of juice.
“Anyway, back now,” he said feebly.
“You — you look better,” said Harry, who was determined to keep
the conversation moving away from Sirius.
“Wha?” said Hagrid, raising a massive hand and feeling his face.
“Oh — oh yeah. Well, Grawpy’s loads better behaved now, loads.
Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back, ter tell yeh the truth.
He’s a good lad, really. . . . I’ve bin thinkin’ abou’ tryin’ ter find him a
lady friend, actually. . . .”
Harry would normally have tried to persuade Hagrid out of this
idea at once. The prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the
forest, possibly even wilder and more brutal than Grawp, was posi-
tively alarming, but somehow Harry could not muster the energy nec-
essary to argue the point. He was starting to wish he was alone again,
and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large
gulps of his dandelion juice, half emptying his glass.
“Ev’ryone knows you’ve bin tellin’ the truth now, Harry,” said Ha-
grid softly and unexpectedly. “Tha’s gotta be better, hasn’ it?”
Harry shrugged.
“Look . . .” Hagrid leaned toward him across the table, “I knew

854
THE SECOND
WAR BEGINS
Sirius longer ’n you did. . . . He died in battle, an’ tha’s the way he’d’ve
wanted ter go —”
“He didn’t want to go at all!” said Harry angrily.
Hagrid bowed his great shaggy head.
“Nah, I don’ reckon he did,” he said quietly. “But still, Harry . . . he
was never one ter sit around at home an’ let other people do the fightin’.
He couldn’ have lived with himself if he hadn’ gone ter help —”
Harry leapt up again.
“I’ve got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing,”
he said mechanically.
“Oh,” said Hagrid, looking rather upset. “Oh . . . all righ then,
Harry . . . Take care of yerself then, an’ drop back in if yeh’ve got a
mo. . . .”
“Yeah . . . right . . .”
Harry crossed to the door as fast as he could and pulled it open. He
was out in the sunshine again before Hagrid had finished saying good-
bye and walked away across the lawn. Once again, people called out
to him as he passed. He closed his eyes for a few moments, wishing
they would all vanish, that he could open his eyes and find himself
alone in the grounds. . . .
A few days ago, before his exams had finished and he had seen the
vision Voldemort had planted in his mind, he would have given al-
most anything for the Wizarding world to know that he had been
telling the truth, for them to believe that Voldemort was back and
know that he was neither a liar nor mad. Now, however . . .
He walked a short way around the lake, sat down on its bank, shel-
tered from the gaze of passersby behind a tangle of shrubs, and stared
out over the gleaming water, thinking. . . .
Perhaps the reason he wanted to be alone was because he had felt
isolated from everybody since his talk with Dumbledore. An invisible
barrier separated him from the rest of the world. He was — he had

855
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
always been — a marked man. It was just that he had never really un-
derstood what that meant. . . .
And yet sitting here on the edge of the lake, with the terrible weight
of grief dragging at him, with the loss of Sirius so raw and fresh inside,
he could not muster any great sense of fear. It was sunny and the
grounds around him were full of laughing people, and even though he
felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race, it
was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include,
or end in, murder. . . .
He sat there for a long time, gazing out at the water, trying not to
think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across
from here, on the opposite bank, that Sirius had collapsed trying to
fend off a hundred dementors. . . .
The sun had fallen before he realized that he was cold. He got up
and returned to the castle, wiping his face on his sleeve as he went.
Ron and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days
before the end of term. Hermione showed signs of wanting to talk
about Sirius, but Ron tended to make hushing noises every time she
mentioned his name. Harry was not sure whether or not he wanted to
talk about his godfather yet; his wishes varied with his mood. He
knew one thing, though: Unhappy as he felt at the moment, he would
greatly miss Hogwarts in a few days’ time when he was back at num-
ber four, Privet Drive. Even though he now understood exactly why
he had to return there every summer, he did not feel any better about
it. Indeed, he had never dreaded his return more.
Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term.
It seemed that she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinner-
time, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortunately for
her, she met Peeves on the way, who seized his last chance to do as
Fred had instructed and chased her gleefully from the premises,

856
THE SECOND
WAR BEGINS
whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk.
Many students ran out into the entrance hall to watch her running
away down the path, and the Heads of Houses tried only halfheart-
edly to restrain their pupils. Indeed, Professor McGonagall sank back
into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and
was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering af-
ter Umbridge herself, because Peeves had borrowed her walking stick.
Their last evening at school arrived; most people had finished pack-
ing and were already heading down to the end-of-term feast, but
Harry had not even started.
“Just do it tomorrow!” said Ron, who was waiting by the door of
their dormitory. “Come on, I’m starving. . . .”
“I won’t be long. . . . Look, you go ahead. . . .”
But when the dormitory door closed behind Ron, Harry made no ef-
fort to speed up his packing. The very last thing he wanted to do was to
attend the end-of-term feast. He was worried that Dumbledore would
make some reference to him in his speech. He was sure to mention
Voldemort’s return; he had talked to them about it last year, after all. . . .
Harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his
trunk to make way for folded ones and, as he did so, noticed a badly
wrapped package lying in a corner of it. He could not think what it
was doing there. He bent down, pulled it out from underneath his
trainers, and examined it.
He realized what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him
just inside the front door of twelve Grimmauld Place. Use it if you need
me, all right?
Harry sank down onto his bed and unwrapped the package. Out
fell a small, square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry
held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him.
He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled
note from Sirius.

857
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
This is a two-way mirror. I’ve got the other.
If you need to speak to me, just say my name
into it; you’ll appear in my mirror and I’ll be
able to talk in yours. James and I used to use
them when we were in separate detentions.
And Harry’s heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead
parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able
to talk to Sirius again, right now, he knew it —
He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the
dormitory was quite empty. He looked back at the mirror, raised it in
front of his face with trembling hands, and said, loudly and clearly,
“Sirius.”
His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even
closer, excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at
him through the fog were definitely his own.
He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang
clearly through the room, “Sirius Black!”
Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the
mirror was still, definitely, his own. . . .
Sirius didn’t have his mirror on him when he went through the arch-
way, said a small voice in Harry’s head. That’s why it’s not working. . . .
Harry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled the mirror
back into the trunk where it shattered. He had been convinced, for a
whole, shining minute, that he was going to see Sirius, talk to him
again. . . .
Disappointment was burning in his throat. He got up and began
throwing his things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken
mirror —
But then an idea struck him. . . . A better idea than a mirror . . . A

858
THE SECOND
WAR BEGINS
much bigger, more important idea . . . How had he never thought of
it before — why had he never asked?
He was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral stair-
case, hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing. He hurtled across
the empty common room, through the portrait hole and off along the
corridor, ignoring the Fat Lady, who called after him, “The feast is
about to start, you know, you’re cutting it very fine!”
But Harry had no intention of going to the feast . . .
How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you
didn’t need one, yet now . . .
He ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either
alive or dead. They were all, clearly, in the Great Hall. Outside his
Charms classroom he came to a halt, panting and thinking disconso-
lately that he would have to wait until later, until after the end of the
feast . . .
But just as he had given up hope he saw it — a translucent some-
body drifting across the end of the corridor.
“Hey — hey Nick! NICK!”
The ghost stuck its head back out of the wall, revealing the extrav-
agantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de
Mimsy-Porpington.
“Good evening,” he said, withdrawing the rest of his body from the
solid stone and smiling at Harry. “I am not the only one who is late,
then? Though,” he sighed, “in rather different senses, of course . . .”
“Nick, can I ask you something?”
A most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nick’s face as
he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little
straighter, apparently to give himself thinking time. He desisted only
when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely.
“Er — now, Harry?” said Nick, looking discomforted. “Can’t it
wait until after the feast?”

859
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
“No — Nick — please,” said Harry, “I really need to talk to you.
Can we go in here?”
Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Head-
less Nick sighed.
“Oh very well,” he said, looking resigned. “I can’t pretend I haven’t
been expecting it.”
Harry was holding the door open for him, but he drifted through
the wall instead.
“Expecting what?” Harry asked, as he closed the door.
“You to come and find me,” said Nick, now gliding over to the win-
dow and looking out at the darkening grounds. “It happens, some-
times . . . when somebody has suffered a . . . loss.”
“Well,” said Harry, refusing to be deflected. “You were right,
I’ve — I’ve come to find you.”
Nick said nothing.
“It’s —” said Harry, who was finding this more awkward than he had
anticipated, “it’s just — you’re dead. But you’re still here, aren’t you?”
Nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds.
“That’s right, isn’t it?” Harry urged him. “You died, but I’m talking
to you. . . . You can walk around Hogwarts and everything, can’t you?”
“Yes,” said Nearly Headless Nick quietly, “I walk and talk, yes.”
“So, you came back, didn’t you?” said Harry urgently. “People can
come back, right? As ghosts. They don’t have to disappear completely.
Well ?” he added impatiently, when Nick continued to say nothing.
Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, “Not everyone can come
back as a ghost.”
“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly.
“Only . . . only wizards.”
“Oh,” said Harry, and he almost laughed with relief. “Well, that’s
okay then, the person I’m asking about is a wizard. So he can come
back, right?”

860
THE SECOND
WAR BEGINS
Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at
Harry. “He won’t come back.”
“Who?”
“Sirius Black,” said Nick.
“But you did!” said Harry angrily. “You came back — you’re dead
and you didn’t disappear —”
“Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to
walk palely where their living selves once trod,” said Nick miserably.
“But very few wizards choose that path.”
“Why not?” said Harry. “Anyway — it doesn’t matter — Sirius
won’t care if it’s unusual, he’ll come back, I know he will!”
And so strong was his belief that Harry actually turned his head to
check the door, sure, for a split second, that he was going to see Sirius,
pearly white and transparent but beaming, walking through it toward
him.
“He will not come back,” repeated Nick quietly. “He will have . . .
gone on.”
“What d’you mean, ‘gone on’?” said Harry quickly. “Gone on
where? Listen — what happens when you die, anyway? Where do you
go? Why doesn’t everyone come back? Why isn’t this place full of
ghosts? Why — ?”
“I cannot answer,” said Nick.
“You’re dead, aren’t you?” said Harry exasperatedly. “Who can an-
swer better than you?”
“I was afraid of death,” said Nick. “I chose to remain behind. I
sometimes wonder whether I oughtn’t to have . . . Well, that is neither
here nor there. . . . In fact, I am neither here nor there. . . .” He gave
a small sad chuckle. “I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry, for
I chose my feeble imitation of life instead. I believe learned wizards
study the matter in the Department of Mysteries —”
“Don’t talk to me about that place!” said Harry fiercely.

861
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
“I am sorry not to have been more help,” said Nick gently. “Well
. . . well, do excuse me . . . the feast, you know . . .”
And he left the room, leaving Harry there alone, gazing blankly at
the wall through which Nick had disappeared.
Harry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again
in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once
more. He walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty
castle, wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again.
He had turned the corner toward the Fat Lady’s corridor when he
saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall. A sec-
ond glance showed him that it was Luna. There were no good hiding
places nearby, she was bound to have heard his footsteps, and in any
case, Harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the
moment.
“Hello,” said Luna vaguely, glancing around at him as she stepped
back from the notice.
“How come you’re not at the feast?” Harry asked.
“Well, I’ve lost most of my possessions,” said Luna serenely. “Peo-
ple take them and hide them, you know. But as it’s the last night, I re-
ally do need them back, so I’ve been putting up signs.”
She gestured toward the notice board, upon which, sure enough,
she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes, with a plea
for their return.
An odd feeling rose in Harry — an emotion quite different from
the anger and grief that had filled him since Sirius’s death. It was a few
moments before he realized that he was feeling sorry for Luna.
“How come people hide your stuff?” he asked her, frowning.
“Oh . . . well . . .” She shrugged. “I think they think I’m a bit odd,
you know. Some people call me ‘Loony’ Lovegood, actually.”
Harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather
painfully.

862
THE SECOND
WAR BEGINS
“That’s no reason for them to take your things,” he said flatly.
“D’you want help finding them?”
“Oh no,” she said, smiling at him. “They’ll come back, they always
do in the end. It was just that I wanted to pack tonight. Anyway . . .
why aren’t you at the feast?”
Harry shrugged. “Just didn’t feel like it.”
“No,” said Luna, observing him with those oddly misty, protuber-
ant eyes. “I don’t suppose you do. That man the Death Eaters killed
was your godfather, wasn’t he? Ginny told me.”
Harry nodded curtly, but found that for some reason he did not
mind Luna talking about Sirius. He had just remembered that she too
could see thestrals.
“Have you . . .” he began. “I mean, who . . . has anyone you’ve
known ever died?”
“Yes,” said Luna simply, “my mother. She was a quite extraordinary
witch, you know, but she did like to experiment and one of her spells
went rather badly wrong one day. I was nine.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled.
“Yes, it was rather horrible,” said Luna conversationally. “I still feel
very sad about it sometimes. But I’ve still got Dad. And anyway, it’s
not as though I’ll never see Mum again, is it?”
“Er — isn’t it?” said Harry uncertainly.
She shook her head in disbelief. “Oh, come on. You heard them,
just behind the veil, didn’t you?”
“You mean . . .”
“In that room with the archway. They were just lurking out of
sight, that’s all. You heard them.”
They looked at each other. Luna was smiling slightly. Harry did not
know what to say, or to think. Luna believed so many extraordinary
things . . . yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil
too. . . .

863
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
“Are you sure you don’t want me to help you look for your stuff?”
he said.
“Oh no,” said Luna. “No, I think I’ll just go down and have some
pudding and wait for it all to turn up. . . . It always does in the end.
. . . Well, have a nice holiday, Harry.”
“Yeah . . . yeah, you too.”
She walked away from him, and as he watched her go, he found that
the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly.
The journey home on the Hogwarts Express next day was eventful in
several ways. Firstly, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who had clearly been
waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher wit-
nesses, attempted to ambush Harry halfway down the train as he
made his way back from the toilet. The attack might have succeeded
had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the at-
tack right outside a compartment full of D.A. members, who saw
what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to
Harry’s aid. By the time Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan
Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein, and Terry Boot
had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry had
taught them, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle resembled nothing so much
as three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniforms as Harry,
Ernie, and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them
there to ooze.
“I must say, I’m looking forward to seeing Malfoy’s mother’s face
when he gets off the train,” said Ernie with some satisfaction, as he
watched Malfoy squirm above him. Ernie had never quite got over the
indignity of Malfoy docking points from Hufflepuff during his brief
spell as a member of the Inquisitorial Squad.
“Goyle’s mum’ll be really pleased, though,” said Ron, who had
come to investigate the source of the commotion. “He’s loads better-

864
THE SECOND
WAR BEGINS
looking now. . . . Anyway, Harry, the food trolley’s just stopped if you
want anything. . . .”
Harry thanked the others and accompanied Ron back to their
compartment, where he bought a large pile of Cauldron Cakes and
Pumpkin Pasties. Hermione was reading the Daily Prophet again,
Ginny was doing a quiz in The Quibbler, and Neville was stroking his
Mimbulus mimbletonia, which had grown a great deal over the year
and now made odd crooning noises when touched.
Harry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard
chess while Hermione read out snippets from the Prophet. It was now
full of articles about how to repel dementors, attempts by the Min-
istry to track down Death Eaters, and hysterical letters claiming that
the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very
morning. . . .
“It hasn’t really started yet,” sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up
the newspaper again. “But it won’t be long now. . . .”
“Hey, Harry,” said Ron, nodding toward the glass window onto the
corridor.
Harry looked around. Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta
Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. His and Cho’s eyes met for
a moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked back down
at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its
square by Ron’s knight.
“What’s — er — going on with you and her anyway?” Ron asked
quietly.
“Nothing,” said Harry truthfully.
“I — er — heard she’s going out with someone else now,” said
Hermione tentatively.
Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at
all. Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no
longer quite connected with him. So much of what he had wanted

865
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
before Sirius’s death felt that way these days. . . . The week that had
elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much,
much longer: It stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in
it, and the one without.
“You’re well out of it, mate,” said Ron forcefully. “I mean, she’s
quite good-looking and all that, but you want someone a bit more
cheerful.”
“She’s probably cheerful enough with someone else,” said Harry,
shrugging.
“Who’s she with now anyway?” Ron asked Hermione, but it was
Ginny who answered.
“Michael Corner,” she said.
“Michael — but —” said Ron, craning around in his seat to stare
at her. “But you were going out with him!”
“Not anymore,” said Ginny resolutely. “He didn’t like Gryffindor
beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch and got really sulky, so I ditched him
and he ran off to comfort Cho instead.” She scratched her nose ab-
sently with the end of her quill, turned The Quibbler upside down,
and began marking her answers. Ron looked highly delighted.
“Well, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot,” he said, prodding
his queen forward toward Harry’s quivering castle. “Good for you.
Just choose someone — better — next time.”
He cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he said it.
“Well, I’ve chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he’s better?” asked
Ginny vaguely.
“WHAT?” shouted Ron, upending the chessboard. Crookshanks
went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered
and hooted angrily from overhead.
As the train slowed down in the approach to King’s Cross, Harry
thought he had never wanted to leave it less. He even wondered fleet-
ingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off, but remained

866
THE SECOND
WAR BEGINS
stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would
take him back to Hogwarts. When it finally puffed to a standstill,
however, he lifted down Hedwig’s cage and prepared to drag his trunk
from the train as usual.
When the ticket inspector signaled to him, Ron, and Hermione
that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms
nine and ten, however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the other
side: a group of people standing there to greet him whom he had not
expected at all.
There was Mad-Eye Moody, looking quite as sinister with his
bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done
without it, his gnarled hands clutching a long staff, his body wrapped
in a voluminous traveling cloak. Tonks stood just behind him, her
bright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering
through the dirty glass station ceiling, wearing heavily patched jeans
and a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend the weird sisters.
Next to Tonks was Lupin, his face pale, his hair graying, a long and
threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers. At the
front of the group stood Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, dressed in their Mug-
gle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new
jackets in some lurid green, scaly material.
“Ron, Ginny!” called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying forward and hugging
her children tightly. “Oh, and Harry dear — how are you?”
“Fine,” lied Harry, as she pulled him into a tight embrace. Over her
shoulder he saw Ron goggling at the twins’ new clothes.
“What are they supposed to be?” he asked, pointing at the jackets.
“Finest dragon skin, little bro,” said Fred, giving his zip a little
tweak. “Business is booming and we thought we’d treat ourselves.”
“Hello, Harry,” said Lupin, as Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry and
turned to greet Hermione.
“Hi,” said Harry. “I didn’t expect . . . what are you all doing here?”

867
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
“Well,” said Lupin with a slight smile, “we thought we might have
a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you
home.”
“I dunno if that’s a good idea,” said Harry at once.
“Oh, I think it is,” growled Moody, who had limped a little closer.
“That’ll be them, will it, Potter?”
He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder; his magical eye was
evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat.
Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad-Eye was point-
ing and there, sure enough, were the three Dursleys, who looked
positively appalled to see Harry’s reception committee.
“Ah, Harry!” said Mr. Weasley, turning from Hermione’s parents,
whom he had been greeting enthusiastically, and who were taking it in
turns to hug Hermione. “Well — shall we do it, then?”
“Yeah, I reckon so, Arthur,” said Moody.
He and Mr. Weasley took the lead across the station toward the
place where the Dursleys stood, apparently rooted to the floor.
Hermione disengaged herself gently from her mother to join the
group.
“Good afternoon,” said Mr. Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon,
coming to a halt right in front of him. “You might remember me, my
name’s Arthur Weasley.”
As Mr. Weasley had singlehandedly demolished most of the Durs-
leys’ living room two years previously, Harry would have been very
surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him. Sure enough, Uncle
Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr. Weasley, but
chose not to say anything, partly, perhaps, because the Dursleys were
outnumbered two to one. Aunt Petunia looked both frightened and
embarrassed. She kept glancing around, as though terrified somebody
she knew would see her in such company. Dudley, meanwhile, seemed
to be trying to look small and insignificant, a feat at which he was fail-
ing extravagantly.

WAR BEGINS
“We thought we’d just have a few words with you about Harry,”
said Mr. Weasley, still smiling.
“Yeah,” growled Moody. “About how he’s treated when he’s at your
place.”
Uncle Vernon’s mustache seemed to bristle with indignation. Possi-
bly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression
that he was dealing with a kindred spirit, he addressed himself to
Moody.
“I am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my
house —”
“I expect what you’re not aware of would fill several books, Durs-
ley,” growled Moody.
“Anyway, that’s not the point,” interjected Tonks, whose pink hair
seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together, for
she closed her eyes rather than look at her. “The point is, if we find
out you’ve been horrible to Harry —”
“— and make no mistake, we’ll hear about it,” added Lupin
pleasantly.
“Yes,” said Mr. Weasley, “even if you won’t let Harry use the
fellytone —”
“Telephone,” whispered Hermione.
“Yeah, if we get any hint that Potter’s been mistreated in any way,
you’ll have us to answer to,” said Moody.
Uncle Vernon swelled ominously. His sense of outrage seemed to
outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs.
“Are you threatening me, sir?” he said, so loudly that passersby ac-
tually turned to stare.
“Yes, I am,” said Mad-Eye, who seemed rather pleased that Uncle
Vernon had grasped this fact so quickly.
“And do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated?”
barked Uncle Vernon.
“Well . . .” said Moody, pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his

sinisterly revolving magical eye. Uncle Vernon leapt backward in hor-
ror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley. “Yes, I’d have to say
you do, Dursley.”
He turned from Uncle Vernon to Harry. “So, Potter . . . give us a
shout if you need us. If we don’t hear from you for three days in a row,
we’ll send someone along. . . .”
Aunt Petunia whimpered piteously. It could not have been plainer
that she was thinking of what the neighbors would say if they caught
sight of these people marching up the garden path.
“ ’Bye, then, Potter,” said Moody, grasping Harry’s shoulder for a
moment with a gnarled hand.
“Take care, Harry,” said Lupin quietly. “Keep in touch.”
“Harry, we’ll have you away from there as soon as we can,” Mrs.
Weasley whispered, hugging him again.
“We’ll see you soon, mate,” said Ron anxiously, shaking Harry’s
hand.
“Really soon, Harry,” said Hermione earnestly. “We promise.”
Harry nodded. He somehow could not find words to tell them
what it meant to him, to see them all ranged there, on his side. Instead
he smiled, raised a hand in farewell, turned around, and led the way
out of the station toward the sunlit street, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt
Petunia, and Dudley hurrying along in his wake.
